<h2>NOTE TO THE PRESENT EDITION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Such</span>  has been the rapidity of the demand for successive impressions
of this book, that I have found it impossible, until now, to
correct at pages <a href="#Page_31">31</a>, <a href="#Page_87">87</a>, and <a href="#Page_97">97</a> three errors of statement made in the
former editions; and some few other mistakes, not in themselves important,
at pages <a href="#Page_96">96</a>, <a href="#Page_101">101</a>, and <a href="#Page_102">102</a>. I take the opportunity of adding
that the mention at p. <a href="#Page_83">83</a> is not an allusion to the well-known "Penny"
and "Saturday" Magazines, but to weekly periodicals of some years'
earlier date resembling them in form. One of them, I have since
found from a later mention by Dickens himself, was presumably of a
less wholesome and instructive character. "I used," he says, "when
I was at school, to take in the <i>Terrific Register</i>, making myself unspeakably
miserable, and frightening my very wits out of my head, for
the small charge of a penny weekly; which, considering that there was
an illustration to every number in which there was always a pool of
blood, and at least one body, was cheap." An obliging correspondent
writes to me upon my reference to the Fox-under-the-hill, at p. <a href="#Page_62">62</a>:
"Will you permit me to say that the house, shut up and almost ruinous,
is still to be found at the bottom of a curious and most precipitous
court, the entrance of which is just past Salisbury Street.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It
was once, I think, the approach to the halfpenny boats. The house is
now shut out from the water-side by the Embankment."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Dickens</span>, the most popular novelist of the
century, and one of the greatest humorists that England
has produced, was born at Landport in Portsea on Friday,
the 7th of February, 1812.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>His father, John Dickens, a clerk in the Navy-pay
office, was at this time stationed in the Portsmouth
dockyard. He had made acquaintance with the lady,
Elizabeth Barrow, who became afterwards his wife,
through her elder brother, Thomas Barrow, also engaged
on the establishment at Somerset House; and she bore
him in all a family of eight children, of whom two died
in infancy. The eldest, Fanny (born 1810), was followed
by Charles (entered in the baptismal register of Portsea
as Charles John Huffham, though on the very rare
occasions when he subscribed that name he wrote
Huffam); by another son, named Alfred, who died in
childhood; by Letitia (born 1816); by another daughter,
Harriet, who died also in childhood; by Frederick (born
1820); by Alfred Lamert (born 1822); and by Augustus
(born 1827); of all of whom only the second daughter
now survives.</p>

<p>Walter Scott tells us, in his fragment of autobiography,
speaking of the strange remedies applied to his lameness,
that he remembered lying on the floor in the parlor of
his grandfather's farm-house, swathed up in a sheepskin
warm from the body of the sheep, being then not three
years old. David Copperfield's memory goes beyond
this. He represents himself seeing so far back into the
blank of his infancy as to discern therein his mother
and her servant, dwarfed to his sight by stooping down
or kneeling on the floor, and himself going unsteadily
from the one to the other. He admits this may be
fancy, though he believes the power of observation in
numbers of very young children to be quite wonderful
for its closeness and accuracy, and thinks that the recollection
of most of us can go farther back into such times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
than many of us suppose. But what he adds is certainly
not fancy. "If it should appear from anything I may
set down in this narrative that I was a child of close
observation, or that as a man I have a strong memory
of my childhood, I undoubtedly lay claim to both of
these characteristics." Applicable as it might be to
David Copperfield, this was simply and unaffectedly
true of Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>He has often told me that he remembered the small
front garden to the house at Portsea, from which he was
taken away when he was two years old, and where,
watched by a nurse through a low kitchen-window almost
level with the gravel walk, he trotted about with something
to eat, and his little elder sister with him. He
was carried from the garden one day to see the soldiers
exercise; and I perfectly recollect that, on our being
at Portsmouth together while he was writing <i>Nickleby</i>,
he recognized the exact shape of the military parade
seen by him as a very infant, on the same spot, a quarter
of a century before.</p>

<p>When his father was again brought up by his duties
to London from Portsmouth, they went into lodgings
in Norfolk Street, Middlesex Hospital; and it lived
also in the child's memory that they had come away
from Portsea in the snow. Their home, shortly after,
was again changed, on the elder Dickens being placed
upon duty in Chatham dockyard; and the house where
he lived in Chatham, which had a plain-looking whitewashed
plaster front and a small garden before and behind,
was in St. Mary's Place, otherwise called the
Brook, and next door to a Baptist meeting-house called
Providence Chapel, of which a Mr. Giles, to be presently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
mentioned, was minister. Charles at this time
was between four and five years old;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and here he
stayed till he was nine. Here the most durable of his
early impressions were received; and the associations
that were around him when he died were those which
at the outset of his life had affected him most strongly.</p>

<p>The house called Gadshill Place stands on the strip
of highest ground in the main road between Rochester
and Gravesend. Often had we traveled past it together,
years and years before it became his home, and
never without some allusion to what he told me when
first I saw it in his company, that amid the recollections
connected with his childhood it held always a
prominent place, for, upon first seeing it as he came
from Chatham with his father, and looking up at it with
much admiration, he had been promised that he might
himself live in it, or in some such house, when he came
to be a man, if he would only work hard enough.
Which for a long time was his ambition. The story is
a pleasant one, and receives authentic confirmation at
the opening of one of his essays on traveling abroad,
when as he passes along the road to Canterbury there
crosses it a vision of his former self:</p>

<p>"So smooth was the old high-road, and so fresh were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the horses, and so fast went I, that it was midway between
Gravesend and Rochester, and the widening river
was bearing the ships, white-sailed or black-smoked, out
to sea, when I noticed by the wayside a very queer
small boy.</p>

<p>"'Holloa!' said I to the very queer small boy,
'where do you live?'</p>

<p>"'At Chatham,' says he.</p>

<p>"'What do you do there?' says I.</p>

<p>"'I go to school,' says he.</p>

<p>"I took him up in a moment, and we went on. Presently,
the very queer small boy says, 'This is Gadshill
we are coming to, where Falstaff went out to rob those
travelers, and ran away.'</p>

<p>"'You know something about Falstaff, eh?' said I.</p>

<p>"'All about him,' said the very queer small boy. 'I
am old (I am nine), and I read all sorts of books. But
<i>do</i> let us stop at the top of the hill, and look at the
house there, if you please!'</p>

<p>"'You admire that house?' said I.</p>

<p>"'Bless you, sir,' said the very queer small boy,
'when I was not more than half as old as nine, it used
to be a treat for me to be brought to look at it. And
now I am nine, I come by myself to look at it. And
ever since I can recollect, my father, seeing me so fond
of it, has often said to me, <i>If you were to be very persevering
and were to work hard, you might some day come
to live in it</i>. Though that's impossible!' said the very
queer small boy, drawing a low breath, and now staring
at the house out of window with all his might.</p>

<p>"I was rather amazed to be told this by the very
queer small boy; for that house happens to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> <i>my</i>
house, and I have reason to believe that what he said
was true."</p>

<p>The queer small boy was indeed his very self. He
was a very little and a very sickly boy. He was subject
to attacks of violent spasm which disabled him for any
active exertion. He was never a good little cricket-player.
He was never a first-rate hand at marbles, or
peg-top, or prisoner's base. But he had great pleasure
in watching the other boys, officers' sons for the most
part, at these games, reading while they played; and
he had always the belief that this early sickness had
brought to himself one inestimable advantage, in the
circumstance of his weak health having strongly inclined
him to reading. It will not appear, as my narrative
moves on, that he owed much to his parents, or
was other than in his first letter to Washington Irving
he described himself to have been, a "very small and
not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy;" but he has
frequently been heard to say that his first desire for
knowledge, and his earliest passion for reading, were
awakened by his mother, who taught him the first
rudiments not only of English, but also, a little later,
of Latin. She taught him regularly every day for a
long time, and taught him, he was convinced, thoroughly
well. I once put to him a question in connection
with this to which he replied in almost exactly the
words he placed five years later in the mouth of David
Copperfield: "I faintly remember her teaching me the
alphabet; and when I look upon the fat black letters
in the primer, the puzzling novelty of their shapes, and
the easy good nature of O and S, always seem to present
themselves before me as they used to do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Then followed the preparatory day-school, a school
for girls and boys to which he went with his sister
Fanny, and which was in a place called Rome (pronounced
Room) Lane. Revisiting Chatham in his
manhood, and looking for the place, he found it had
been pulled down to make a new street, "ages" before;
but out of the distance of the ages arose nevertheless
a not dim impression that it had been over a
dyer's shop; that he went up steps to it; that he had
frequently grazed his knees in doing so; and that in
trying to scrape the mud off a very unsteady little
shoe, he generally got his leg over the scraper.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Other
similar memories of childhood have dropped from him
occasionally in his lesser writings; whose readers may
remember how vividly portions of his boyhood are reproduced
in his fancy of the Christmas-tree, and will
hardly have forgotten what he says, in his thoughtful
little paper on Nurses' stories, of the doubtful places
and people to which children may be introduced before
they are six years old, and forced, night after night, to
go back to against their wills, by servants to whom they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
are intrusted. That childhood exaggerates what it
sees, too, has he not tenderly told? How he thought
the Rochester High Street must be at least as wide as
Regent Street, which he afterwards discovered to be
little better than a lane; how the public clock in it,
supposed to be the finest clock in the world, turned out
to be as moon-faced and weak a clock as a man's eyes
ever saw; and how in its town-hall, which had appeared
to him once so glorious a structure that he had set it
up in his mind as the model on which the genie of the
lamp built the palace for Aladdin, he had painfully to
recognize a mere mean little heap of bricks, like a
chapel gone demented. Yet not so painfully, either,
when second thoughts wisely came. "Ah! who was I
that I should quarrel with the town for being changed
to me, when I myself had come back, so changed, to
it? All my early readings and early imaginations dated
from this place, and I took them away so full of innocent
construction and guileless belief, and I brought
them back so worn and torn, so much the wiser and so
much the worse!"</p>

<p>And here I may at once expressly mention, what already
has been hinted, that even as Fielding described
himself and his belongings in Captain Booth and
Amelia, and protested always that he had writ in his
books nothing more than he had seen in life, so it may
be said of Dickens in more especial relation to David
Copperfield. Many guesses have been made since his
death, connecting David's autobiography with his own;
accounting, by means of such actual experiences, for the
so frequent recurrence in his writings of the prison-life,
its humor and pathos, described in them with such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
wonderful reality; and discovering in what David tells
Steerforth at school of the stories he had read in his
childhood, what it was that had given the bent to his
own genius. There is not only truth in all this, but it
will very shortly be seen that the identity went deeper
than any had supposed, and covered experiences not less
startling in the reality than they appear to be in the
fiction.</p>

<p>Of the "readings" and "imaginations" which he
describes as brought away from Chatham, this authority
can tell us. It is one of the many passages in <i>Copperfield</i>
which are literally true, and its proper place is here.
"My father had left a small collection of books in a
little room up-stairs to which I had access (for it adjoined
my own), and which nobody else in our house
ever troubled. From that blessed little room, <i>Roderick
Random</i>, <i>Peregrine Pickle</i>, <i>Humphrey Clinker</i>, <i>Tom
Jones</i>, the <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i>, <i>Don Quixote</i>, <i>Gil Blas</i>,
and <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> came out, a glorious host, to keep
me company. They kept alive my fancy, and my hope
of something beyond that place and time,&mdash;they, and
the <i>Arabian Nights</i> and the <i>Tales of the Genii</i>,&mdash;and
did me no harm; for whatever harm was in some of
them was not there for me; <i>I</i> knew nothing of it. It
is astonishing to me now how I found time, in the midst
of my porings and blunderings over heavier themes, to
read those books as I did. It is curious to me how I
could ever have consoled myself under my small troubles
(which were great troubles to me), by impersonating my
favorite characters in them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have been Tom
Jones (a child's Tom Jones, a harmless creature) for a
week together. I have sustained my own idea of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Roderick Random for a month at a stretch, I verily
believe. I had a greedy relish for a few volumes of
voyages and travels&mdash;I forget what, now&mdash;that were on
those shelves; and for days and days I can remember
to have gone about my region of our house, armed with
the centre-piece out of an old set of boot-trees: the
perfect realization of Captain Somebody, of the royal
British Navy, in danger of being beset by savages, and
resolved to sell his life at a great price.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When I
think of it, the picture always rises in my mind, of a
summer evening, the boys at play in the churchyard,
and I sitting on my bed, reading as if for life. Every
barn in the neighborhood, every stone in the church,
and every foot of the churchyard, had some association
of its own, in my mind, connected with these books,
and stood for some locality made famous in them. I
have seen Tom Pipes go climbing up the church-steeple;
I have watched Strap, with the knapsack on his back,
stopping to rest himself upon the wicket-gate; and I
<i>know</i> that Commodore Trunnion held that club with
Mr. Pickle, in the parlor of our little village ale-house."
Every word of this personal recollection had
been written down as fact, some years before it found
its way into <i>David Copperfield;</i> the only change in the
fiction being his omission of the name of a cheap series
of novelists then in course of publication, by which his
father had become happily the owner of so large a lump
of literary treasure in his small collection of books.</p>

<p>The usual result followed. The child took to writing,
himself, and became famous in his childish circle for
having written a tragedy called <i>Misnar</i>, the Sultan of
India, founded (and very literally founded, no doubt)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
on one of the <i>Tales of the Genii</i>. Nor was this his only
distinction. He told a story offhand so well, and sang
small comic songs so especially well, that he used to be
elevated on chairs and tables, both at home and abroad,
for more effective display of these talents; and when he
first told me of this, at one of the Twelfth-night parties
on his eldest son's birthday, he said he never recalled
it that his own shrill little voice of childhood did not
again tingle in his ears, and he blushed to think what
a horrible little nuisance he must have been to many
unoffending grown-up people who were called upon to
admire him.</p>

<p>His chief ally and encourager in these displays was a
youth of some ability, much older than himself, named
James Lamert, stepson to his mother's sister, and therefore
a sort of cousin, who was his great patron and
friend in his childish days. Mary, the eldest daughter
of Charles Barrow, himself a lieutenant in the navy,
had for her first husband a commander in the navy
called Allen; on whose death by drowning at Rio
Janeiro she had joined her sister, the navy-pay clerk's
wife, at Chatham; in which place she subsequently
took for her second husband Dr. Lamert, an army-surgeon,
whose son James, even after he had been sent to
Sandhurst for his education, continued still to visit Chatham
from time to time. He had a turn for private
theatricals; and as his father's quarters were in the
ordnance hospital there, a great rambling place otherwise
at that time almost uninhabited, he had plenty
of room in which to get up his entertainments. The
staff-doctor himself played his part, and his portrait
will be found in <i>Pickwick</i>.</p>

<p>By Lamert, I have often heard him say, he was first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
taken to the theatre at the very tenderest age. He could
hardly, however, have been younger than Charles Lamb,
whose first experience was of having seen <i>Artaxerxes</i>
when six years old; and certainly not younger than
Walter Scott, who was only four when he saw <i>As You
Like It</i> on the Bath stage, and remembered having
screamed out, <i>Ain't they brothers?</i> when scandalized
by Orlando and Oliver beginning to fight.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But he
was at any rate old enough to recollect how his young
heart leaped with terror as the wicked king Richard,
struggling for life against the virtuous Richmond,
backed up and bumped against the box in which he
was; and subsequent visits to the same sanctuary, as
he tells us, revealed to him many wondrous secrets, "of
which not the least terrific were, that the witches in
<i>Macbeth</i> bore an awful resemblance to the thanes and
other proper inhabitants of Scotland; and that the
good king Duncan couldn't rest in his grave, but was
constantly coming out of it and calling himself somebody
else."</p>

<p>During the last two years of Charles's residence at
Chatham, he was sent to a school kept in Clover Lane
by the young Baptist minister already named, Mr.
William Giles. I have the picture of him here, very
strongly in my mind, as a sensitive, thoughtful, feeble-bodied
little boy, with an unusual sort of knowledge
and fancy for such a child, and with a dangerous kind
of wandering intelligence that a teacher might turn to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
good or evil, happiness or misery, as he directed it.
Nor does the influence of Mr. Giles, such as it was,
seem to have been other than favorable. Charles had
himself a not ungrateful sense in after-years that this
first of his masters, in his little-cared-for childhood, had
pronounced him to be a boy of capacity; and when,
about half-way through the publication of <i>Pickwick</i>, his
old teacher sent a silver snuff-box with admiring inscription
to the "inimitable Boz," it reminded him of praise
far more precious obtained by him at his first year's examination
in the Clover Lane academy, when his recitation
of a piece out of the <i>Humorist's Miscellany</i> about
Doctor Bolus had received, unless his youthful vanity
bewildered him, a double encore. A habit, the only
bad one taught him by Mr. Giles, of taking for a time,
in very moderate quantities, the snuff called Irish blackguard,
was the result of this gift from his old master;
but he abandoned it after some few years, and it was
never resumed.</p>

<p>It was in the boys' playing-ground near Clover Lane
in which the school stood, that, according to one of his
youthful memories, he had been, in the hay-making
time, delivered from the dungeons of Seringapatam,
an immense pile "(of haycock)," by his countrymen
the victorious British "(boy next door and his two
cousins)," and had been recognized with ecstasy by his
affianced one "(Miss Green)," who had come all the
way from England "(second house in the terrace)" to
ransom and marry him. It was in this playing-field, too,
as he has himself recorded, he first heard in confidence
from one whose father was greatly connected, "being
under government," of the existence of a terrible banditti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
called <i>the radicals</i>, whose principles were that the
prince-regent wore stays, that nobody had a right to any
salary, and that the army and navy ought to be put
down; horrors at which he trembled in his bed, after
supplicating that the radicals might be speedily taken
and hanged. Nor was it the least of the disappointments
of his visit in after-life to the scenes of his boyhood
that he found this play-field had been swallowed
up by a railway station. It was gone, with its two
beautiful trees of hawthorn; and where the hedge, the
turf, and all the buttercups and daisies had been, there
was nothing but the stoniest of jolting roads.</p>

<p>He was not much over nine years old when his father
was recalled from Chatham to Somerset House, and he
had to leave this good master, and the old place endeared
to him by recollections that clung to him afterwards all
his life long. It was here he had made the acquaintance
not only of the famous books that David Copperfield
specially names, of <i>Roderick Random</i>, <i>Peregrine Pickle</i>,
<i>Humphrey Clinker</i>, <i>Tom Jones</i>, the <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i>,
<i>Don Quixote</i>, <i>Gil Blas</i>, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>, and the <i>Tales of the Genii</i>, but also of the <i>Spectator</i>,
the <i>Tatler</i>, the <i>Idler</i>, the <i>Citizen of the World</i>,
and Mrs. Inchbald's <i>Collection of Farces</i>. These latter
had been, as well, in the little library to which access
was open to him; and of all of them his earliest remembrance
was the having read them over and over at Chatham,
not for the first, the second, or the third time.
They were a host of friends when he had no single
friend; and in leaving the place, I have often heard
him say, he seemed to be leaving them too, and everything
that had given his ailing little life its picturesqueness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
or sunshine. It was the birthplace of his fancy;
and he hardly knew what store he had set by its busy
varieties of change and scene, until he saw the falling
cloud that was to hide its pictures from him forever.
The gay bright regiments always going and coming,
the continual paradings and firings, the successions of
sham sieges and sham defenses, the plays got up by his
cousin in the hospital, the navy-pay yacht in which he
had sailed to Sheerness with his father, and the ships
floating out in the Medway with their far visions of
sea,&mdash;he was to lose them all. He was never to watch
the boys at their games any more, or see them sham
over again the sham sieges and sham defenses. He was
to be taken to London inside the stage-coach Commodore;
and Kentish woods and fields, Cobham park and
hall, Rochester cathedral and castle, and all the wonderful
romance together, including the red-cheeked
baby he had been wildly in love with, were to vanish
like a dream. "On the night before we came away,"
he told me, "my good master came flitting in among
the packing-cases to give me Goldsmith's <i>Bee</i> as a keepsake.
Which I kept for his sake, and its own, a long
time afterwards." A longer time afterwards he recollected
the stage-coach journey, and said in one of his
published papers that never had he forgotten, through
all the intervening years, the smell of the damp straw
in which he was packed and forwarded like game, carriage-paid.
"There was no other inside passenger, and
I consumed my sandwiches in solitude and dreariness,
and it rained hard all the way, and I thought life
sloppier than I expected to find it."</p>

<p>The earliest impressions received and retained by him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in London were of his father's money involvements; and
now first he heard mentioned "the deed," representing
that crisis of his father's affairs in fact which is ascribed
in fiction to Mr. Micawber's. He knew it in later days
to have been a composition with creditors; though at
this earlier date he was conscious of having confounded
it with parchments of a much more demoniacal description.
One result from the awful document soon showed
itself in enforced retrenchment. The family had to
take up its abode in a house in Bayham Street, Camden-town.</p>

<p>Bayham Street was about the poorest part of the
London suburbs then, and the house was a mean small
tenement, with a wretched little back-garden abutting
on a squalid court. Here was no place for new acquaintances
to him: no boys were near with whom he
might hope to become in any way familiar. A washerwoman
lived next door, and a Bow-Street officer lived
over the way. Many, many times has he spoken to me
of this, and how he seemed at once to fall into a solitary
condition apart from all other boys of his own age,
and to sink into a neglected state at home which had
been always quite unaccountable to him. "As I thought,"
he said on one occasion very bitterly, "in the little back-garret
in Bayham Street, of all I had lost in losing
Chatham, what would I have given, if I had had anything
to give, to have been sent back to any other
school, to have been taught something anywhere!"
He was at another school already, not knowing it.
The self-education forced upon him was teaching him,
all unconsciously as yet, what, for the future that
awaited him, it most behooved him to know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>That he took, from the very beginning of this Bayham-Street
life, his first impression of that struggling
poverty which is nowhere more vividly shown than in
the commoner streets of the ordinary London suburb,
and which enriched his earliest writings with a freshness
of original humor and quite unstudied pathos that
gave them much of their sudden popularity, there cannot
be a doubt. "I certainly understood it," he has
often said to me, "quite as well then as I do now."
But he was not conscious yet that he did so understand
it, or of the influence it was exerting on his life even
then. It seems almost too much to assert of a child,
say at nine or ten years old, that his observation of
everything was as close and good, or that he had as
much intuitive understanding of the character and
weaknesses of the grown-up people around him, as
when the same keen and wonderful faculty had made
him famous among men. But my experience of him led
me to put implicit faith in the assertion he unvaryingly
himself made, that he had never seen any cause to correct
or change what in his boyhood was his own secret
impression of anybody whom he had had, as a grown
man, the opportunity of testing in later years.</p>

<p>How it came that, being what he was, he should
now have fallen into the misery and neglect of the time
about to be described, was a subject on which thoughts
were frequently interchanged between us; and on one
occasion he gave me a sketch of the character of his
father, which, as I can here repeat it in the exact words
employed by him, will be the best preface I can make
to what I feel that I have no alternative but to tell. "I
know my father to be as kind-hearted and generous a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
man as ever lived in the world. Everything that I can
remember of his conduct to his wife, or children, or
friends, in sickness or affliction, is beyond all praise.
By me, as a sick child, he has watched night and day,
unweariedly and patiently, many nights and days. He
never undertook any business, charge, or trust, that he
did not zealously, conscientiously, punctually, honorably
discharge. His industry has always been untiring.
He was proud of me, in his way, and had a great admiration
of the comic singing. But, in the ease of his
temper, and the straitness of his means, he appeared to
have utterly lost at this time the idea of educating me
at all, and to have utterly put from him the notion that
I had any claim upon him, in that regard, whatever.
So I degenerated into cleaning his boots of a morning,
and my own; and making myself useful in the work
of the little house; and looking after my younger
brothers and sisters (we were now six in all); and going
on such poor errands as arose out of our poor way of
living."</p>

<p>The cousin by marriage of whom I have spoken,
James Lamert, who had lately completed his education
at Sandhurst and was waiting in hopes of a commission,
lived now with the family in Bayham Street, and had
not lost his taste for the stage, or his ingenuities in connection
with it. Taking pity on the solitary lad, he
made and painted a little theatre for him. It was the
only fanciful reality of his present life; but it could
not supply what he missed most sorely, the companionship
of boys of his own age, with whom he might share
in the advantages of school and contend for its prizes.
His sister Fanny was at about this time elected as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
pupil to the Royal Academy of Music; and he has told
me what a stab to his heart it was, thinking of his own
disregarded condition, to see her go away to begin her
education, amid the tearful good wishes of everybody
in the house.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as time went on, his own education still
unconsciously went on as well, under the sternest and
most potent of teachers; and, neglected and miserable
as he was, he managed gradually to transfer to London
all the dreaminess and all the romance with which he
had invested Chatham. There were then at the top of
Bayham Street some almshouses, and were still when
he revisited it with me nearly twenty-seven years ago;
and to go to this spot, he told me, and look from it
over the dust-heaps and dock-leaves and fields (no
longer there when we saw it together) at the cupola of
St. Paul's looming through the smoke, was a treat that
served him for hours of vague reflection afterwards.
To be taken out for a walk into the real town, especially
if it were anywhere about Covent Garden or the
Strand, perfectly entranced him with pleasure. But
most of all he had a profound attraction of repulsion
to St. Giles's. If he could only induce whomsoever
took him out to take him through Seven-Dials, he was
supremely happy. "Good Heaven!" he would exclaim,
"what wild visions of prodigies of wickedness,
want, and beggary arose in my mind out of that place!"
He was all this time, the reader will remember, still
subject to continual attacks of illness, and, by reason
of them, a very small boy even for his age.</p>

<p>That part of his boyhood is now very near of which,
when the days of fame and prosperity came to him, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
felt the weight upon his memory as a painful burden
until he could lighten it by sharing it with a friend;
and an accident I will presently mention led him first
to reveal it. There is, however, an interval of some
months still to be described, of which, from conversations
or letters that passed between us, after or because
of this confidence, and that already have yielded fruit
to these pages, I can supply some vague and desultory
notices. The use thus made of them, it is due to myself
to remark, was contemplated then; for though,
long before his death, I had ceased to believe it likely
that I should survive to write about him, he had never
withdrawn the wish at this early time strongly expressed,
or the confidences, not only then but to the
very eve of his death reposed in me, that were to enable
me to fulfill it.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The fulfillment indeed he had himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
rendered more easy by partially uplifting the veil in
<i>David Copperfield</i>.</p>

<p>The visits made from Bayham Street were chiefly to
two connections of the family, his mother's elder
brother and his godfather. The latter, who was a rigger,
and mast-, oar-, and block-maker, lived at Limehouse
in a substantial handsome sort of way, and was
kind to his godchild. It was always a great treat to
him to go to Mr. Huffham's; and the London night-sights
as he returned were a perpetual joy and marvel.
Here, too, the comic-singing accomplishment was
brought into play so greatly to the admiration of one
of the godfather's guests, an honest boat-builder, that
he pronounced the little lad to be a "progidy." The
visits to the uncle who was at this time fellow-clerk with
his father, in Somerset House, were nearer home. Mr.
Thomas Barrow, the eldest of his mother's family, had
broken his leg in a fall; and, while laid up with this
illness, his lodging was in Gerrard Street, Soho, in the
upper part of the house of a worthy gentleman then recently
deceased, a bookseller named Manson, father to
the partner in the celebrated firm of Christie &amp; Manson,
whose widow at this time carried on the business.
Attracted by the look of the lad as he went up-stairs,
these good people lent him books to amuse him;
among them Miss Porter's <i>Scottish Chiefs</i>, Holbein's
<i>Dance of Death</i>, and George Colman's <i>Broad Grins</i>.
The latter seized his fancy very much; and he was so
impressed by its description of Covent Garden, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
piece called "The Elder Brother," that he stole down
to the market by himself to compare it with the book.
He remembered, as he said in telling me this, snuffing
up the flavor of the faded cabbage-leaves as if it were
the very breath of comic fiction. Nor was he far
wrong, as comic fiction then and for some time after
was. It was reserved for himself to give sweeter and
fresher breath to it. Many years were to pass first, but
he was beginning already to make the trial.</p>

<p>His uncle was shaved by a very odd old barber out
of Dean Street, Soho, who was never tired of reviewing
the events of the last war, and especially of detecting
Napoleon's mistakes, and rearranging his whole
life for him on a plan of his own. The boy wrote a
description of this old barber, but never had courage
to show it. At about the same time, taking for his
model the description of the canon's housekeeper in
<i>Gil Blas</i>, he sketched a deaf old woman who waited
on them in Bayham Street, and who made delicate
hashes with walnut-ketchup. As little did he dare to
show this, either; though he thought it, himself, extremely
clever.</p>

<p>In Bayham Street, meanwhile, affairs were going on
badly; the poor boy's visits to his uncle, while the
latter was still kept a prisoner by his accident, were
interrupted by another attack of fever; and on his
recovery the mysterious "deed" had again come uppermost.
His father's resources were so low, and all
his expedients so thoroughly exhausted, that trial was
to be made whether his mother might not come to the
rescue. The time was arrived for her to exert herself, she
said; and she "must do something." The godfather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
down at Limehouse was reported to have an Indian
connection. People in the East Indies always sent
their children home to be educated. She would set up
a school. They would all grow rich by it. And then,
thought the sick boy, "perhaps even I might go to
school myself."</p>

<p>A house was soon found at number four, Gower Street
north; a large brass plate on the door announced <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Dickens's Establishment</span>; and the result I can give
in the exact words of the then small actor in the comedy,
whose hopes it had raised so high: "I left, at a great
many other doors, a great many circulars calling attention
to the merits of the establishment. Yet nobody
ever came to school, nor do I recollect that anybody
ever proposed to come, or that the least preparation was
made to receive anybody. But I know that we got on
very badly with the butcher and baker; that very often
we had not too much for dinner; and that at last my
father was arrested." The interval between the sponging-house
and the prison was passed by the sorrowful
lad in running errands and carrying messages for the
prisoner, delivered with swollen eyes and through shining
tears; and the last words said to him by his father
before he was finally carried to the Marshalsea were to
the effect that the sun was set upon him forever. "I
really believed at the time," said Dickens to me, "that
they had broken my heart." He took afterwards ample
revenge for this false alarm by making all the world
laugh at them in <i>David Copperfield</i>.</p>

<p>The readers of Mr. Micawber's history who remember
David's first visit to the Marshalsea prison, and how
upon seeing the turnkey he recalled the turnkey in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
blanket in <i>Roderick Random</i>, will read with curious
interest what follows, written as a personal experience
of fact two or three years before the fiction had even
entered into his thoughts:</p>

<p>"My father was waiting for me in the lodge, and we
went up to his room (on the top story but one), and
cried very much. And he told me, I remember, to
take warning by the Marshalsea, and to observe that if
a man had twenty pounds a year and spent nineteen
pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence, he would be
happy; but that a shilling spent the other way would
make him wretched. I see the fire we sat before, now;
with two bricks inside the rusted grate, one on each side,
to prevent its burning too many coals. Some other
debtor shared the room with him, who came in by-and-by;
and, as the dinner was a joint-stock repast, I was
sent up to 'Captain Porter' in the room overhead, with
Mr. Dickens's compliments, and I was his son, and
could he, Captain P., lend me a knife and fork?</p>

<p>"Captain Porter lent the knife and fork, with his
compliments in return. There was a very dirty lady in
his little room; and two wan girls, his daughters, with
shock heads of hair. I thought I should not have liked
to borrow Captain Porter's comb. The captain himself
was in the last extremity of shabbiness; and if I could
draw at all, I would draw an accurate portrait of the
old, old, brown great-coat he wore, with no other coat
below it. His whiskers were large. I saw his bed rolled
up in a corner; and what plates, and dishes, and pots
he had, on a shelf; and I knew (God knows how) that
the two girls with the shock heads were Captain Porter's
natural children, and that the dirty lady was not married<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to Captain P. My timid, wondering station on
his threshold was not occupied more than a couple of
minutes, I dare say; but I came down again to the
room below with all this as surely in my knowledge as
the knife and fork were in my hand."</p>

<p>How there was something agreeable and gipsy-like in
the dinner after all, and how he took back the captain's
knife and fork early in the afternoon, and how he went
home to comfort his mother with an account of his visit,
David Copperfield has also accurately told. Then, at
home, came many miserable daily struggles that seemed
to last an immense time, yet did not perhaps cover
many weeks. Almost everything by degrees was sold
or pawned, little Charles being the principal agent in
those sorrowful transactions. Such of the books as had
been brought from Chatham&mdash;<i>Peregrine Pickle</i>, <i>Roderick
Random</i>, <i>Tom Jones</i>, <i>Humphrey Clinker</i>, and all the
rest&mdash;went first. They were carried off from the little
chiffonier, which his father called the library, to a bookseller
in the Hampstead Road, the same that David
Copperfield describes as in the City Road; and the
account of the sales, as they actually occurred and were
told to me long before David was born, was reproduced
word for word in his imaginary narrative: "The keeper
of this bookstall, who lived in a little house behind it,
used to get tipsy every night, and to be violently
scolded by his wife every morning. More than once,
when I went there early, I had audience of him in a
turn-up bedstead, with a cut in his forehead or a black
eye bearing witness to his excesses overnight (I am
afraid he was quarrelsome in his drink); and he, with a
shaking hand, endeavoring to find the needful shillings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in one or other of the pockets of his clothes, which lay
upon the floor, while his wife, with a baby in her arms
and her shoes down at heel, never left off rating him.
Sometimes he had lost his money, and then he would
ask me to call again; but his wife had always got some
(had taken his, I dare say, while he was drunk), and
secretly completed the bargain on the stairs, as we went
down together."</p>

<p>The same pawnbroker's shop, too, which was so well
known to David, became not less familiar to Charles;
and a good deal of notice was here taken of him by the
pawnbroker, or by his principal clerk who officiated
behind the counter, and who, while making out the
duplicate, liked of all things to hear the lad conjugate
a Latin verb and translate or decline his <i>musa</i> and
<i>dominus</i>. Everything to this accompaniment went
gradually; until, at last, even of the furniture of Gower
Street number four there was nothing left except a few
chairs, a kitchen table, and some beds. Then they
encamped, as it were, in the two parlors of the emptied
house, and lived there night and day.</p>

<p>All which is but the prelude to what remains to be
described.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> incidents to be told now would probably never
have been known to me, or indeed any of the occurrences
of his childhood and youth, but for the accident
of a question which I put to him one day in the March
or April of 1847.</p>

<p>I asked if he remembered ever having seen in his
boyhood our friend the elder Mr. Dilke, his father's
acquaintance and contemporary, who had been a clerk
in the same office in Somerset House to which Mr.
John Dickens belonged. Yes, he said, he recollected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
seeing him at a house in Gerrard Street, where his
uncle Barrow lodged during an illness, and Mr. Dilke
had visited him. Never at any other time. Upon
which I told him that some one else had been intended
in the mention made to me, for that the reference implied
not merely his being met accidentally, but his
having had some juvenile employment in a warehouse
near the Strand; at which place Mr. Dilke, being with
the elder Dickens one day, had noticed him, and received,
in return for the gift of a half-crown, a very
low bow. He was silent for several minutes; I felt
that I had unintentionally touched a painful place in
his memory; and to Mr. Dilke I never spoke of the
subject again. It was not, however, then, but some
weeks later, that Dickens made further allusion to my
thus having struck unconsciously upon a time of which
he never could lose the remembrance while he remembered
anything, and the recollection of which, at intervals,
haunted him and made him miserable, even to
that hour.</p>

<p>Very shortly afterwards I learnt in all their detail the
incidents that had been so painful to him, and what
then was said to me or written respecting them revealed
the story of his boyhood. The idea of <i>David Copperfield</i>,
which was to take all the world into his confidence,
had not at this time occurred to him; but what
it had so startled me to know, his readers were afterwards
told with only such change or addition as for the
time might sufficiently disguise himself under cover of
his hero. For the poor little lad, with good ability
and a most sensitive nature, turned at the age of ten
into a "laboring hind" in the service of "Murdstone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and Grinby," and conscious already of what made it
seem very strange to him that he could so easily have
been thrown away at such an age, was indeed himself.
His was the secret agony of soul at finding himself
"companion to Mick Walker and Mealy Potatoes,"
and his the tears that mingled with the water in which
he and they rinsed and washed out bottles. It had all
been written, as fact, before he thought of any other
use for it; and it was not until several months later,
when the fancy of <i>David Copperfield</i>, itself suggested
by what he had so written of his early troubles, began
to take shape in his mind, that he abandoned his first
intention of writing his own life. Those warehouse
experiences fell then so aptly into the subject he had
chosen, that he could not resist the temptation of immediately
using them; and the manuscript recording
them, which was but the first portion of what he had
designed to write, was embodied in the substance of
the eleventh and earlier chapters of his novel. What
already had been sent to me, however, and proof-sheets
of the novel interlined at the time, enable me now to
separate the fact from the fiction, and to supply to the
story of the author's childhood those passages, omitted
from the book, which, apart from their illustration of
the growth of his character, present to us a picture of
tragical suffering, and of tender as well as humorous
fancy, unsurpassed in even the wonders of his published
writings.</p>

<p>The person indirectly responsible for the scenes to be
described was the young relative James Lamert, the
cousin by his aunt's marriage of whom I have made frequent
mention, who got up the plays at Chatham, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
after passing at Sandhurst had been living with the
family in Bayham Street in the hope of obtaining a
commission in the army. This did not come until long
afterwards, when, in consideration of his father's services,
he received it, and relinquished it then in favor
of a younger brother; but he had meanwhile, before
the family removed from Camden-town, ceased to live
with them. The husband of a sister of his (of the
same name as himself, being indeed his cousin, George
Lamert), a man of some property, had recently embarked
in an odd sort of commercial speculation, and
had taken him into his office and his house, to assist in
it. I give now the fragment of the autobiography of
Dickens:</p>

<p>"This speculation was a rivalry of 'Warren's Blacking,
30, Strand,'&mdash;at that time very famous. One
Jonathan Warren (the famous one was Robert), living
at 30, Hungerford Stairs, or Market, Strand (for I forget
which it was called then), claimed to have been the
original inventor or proprietor of the blacking-recipe,
and to have been deposed and ill used by his renowned
relation. At last he put himself in the way of selling
his recipe, and his name, and his 30, Hungerford Stairs,
Strand (30, Strand, very large, and the intermediate
direction very small), for an annuity; and he set forth
by his agents that a little capital would make a great
business of it. The man of some property was found
in George Lamert, the cousin and brother-in-law of
James. He bought this right and title, and went into
the blacking-business and the blacking-premises.</p>

<p>"&mdash;In an evil hour for me, as I often bitterly thought.
Its chief manager, James Lamert, the relative who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
lived with us in Bayham Street, seeing how I was employed
from day to day, and knowing what our domestic
circumstances then were, proposed that I should go
into the blacking-warehouse, to be as useful as I could,
at a salary, I think, of six shillings a week. I am not
clear whether it was six or seven. I am inclined to
believe, from my uncertainty on this head, that it was
six at first, and seven afterwards. At any rate, the offer
was accepted very willingly by my father and mother,
and on a Monday morning I went down to the blacking-warehouse
to begin my business life.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful to me how I could have been so
easily cast away at such an age. It is wonderful to me
that, even after my descent into the poor little drudge
I had been since we came to London, no one had compassion
enough on me&mdash;a child of singular abilities,
quick, eager, delicate, and soon hurt, bodily or mentally&mdash;to
suggest that something might have been
spared, as certainly it might have been, to place me at
any common school. Our friends, I take it, were tired
out. No one made any sign. My father and mother
were quite satisfied. They could hardly have been
more so if I had been twenty years of age, distinguished
at a grammar-school, and going to Cambridge.</p>

<p>"The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the
left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It
was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course
on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted
rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and
the old gray rats swarming down in the cellars, and the
sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the
stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The
counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the
coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in
which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover
the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper,
and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them
round with a string; and then to clip the paper close
and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot
of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain
number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch
of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label,
and then go on again with more pots. Two or three
other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on
similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron
and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show
me the trick of using the string and tying the knot.
His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of
using his name, long afterwards, in <i>Oliver Twist</i>.</p>

<p>"Our relative had kindly arranged to teach me
something in the dinner-hour; from twelve to one, I
think it was; every day. But an arrangement so incompatible
with counting-house business soon died
away, from no fault of his or mine; and, for the same
reason, my small work-table, and my grosses of pots,
my papers, string, scissors, paste-pot, and labels, by
little and little, vanished out of the recess in the counting-house,
and kept company with the other small
work-tables, grosses of pots, papers, string, scissors, and
paste-pots, down-stairs. It was not long before Bob
Fagin and I, and another boy whose name was Paul
Green, but who was currently believed to have been
christened Poll (a belief which I transferred, long afterwards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
again, to Mr. Sweedlepipe, in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>),
worked generally, side by side. Bob Fagin was an
orphan, and lived with his brother-in-law, a waterman.
Poll Green's father had the additional distinction of
being a fireman, and was employed at Drury Lane
theatre; where another relation of Poll's, I think his
little sister, did imps in the pantomimes.</p>

<p>"No words can express the secret agony of my soul
as I sunk into this companionship; compared these
every-day associates with those of my happier childhood;
and felt my early hopes of growing up to be a
learned and distinguished man, crushed in my breast.
The deep remembrance of the sense I had of being
utterly neglected and hopeless; of the shame I felt in
my position; of the misery it was to my young heart
to believe that, day by day, what I had learned, and
thought, and delighted in, and raised my fancy and my
emulation up by, was passing away from me, never to
be brought back any more; cannot be written. My
whole nature was so penetrated with the grief and
humiliation of such considerations, that even now,
famous and caressed and happy, I often forget in my
dreams that I have a dear wife and children; even
that I am a man; and wander desolately back to that
time of my life.</p>

<p>"My mother and my brothers and sisters (excepting
Fanny in the Royal Academy of Music) were still encamped,
with a young servant-girl from Chatham workhouse,
in the two parlors in the emptied house in Gower
Street north. It was a long way to go and return within
the dinner-hour, and usually I either carried my dinner
with me, or went and bought it at some neighboring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
shop. In the latter case, it was commonly a saveloy
and a penny loaf; sometimes, a fourpenny plate of beef
from a cook's shop; sometimes, a plate of bread and
cheese, and a glass of beer, from a miserable old public-house
over the way: the Swan, if I remember right, or
the Swan and something else that I have forgotten.
Once, I remember tucking my own bread (which I had
brought from home in the morning) under my arm,
wrapped up in a piece of paper like a book, and going
into the best dining-room in Johnson's alamode beef-house
in Clare Court, Drury Lane, and magnificently
ordering a small plate of alamode beef to eat with it.
What the waiter thought of such a strange little apparition,
coming in all alone, I don't know; but I can see
him now, staring at me as I ate my dinner, and bringing
up the other waiter to look. I gave him a halfpenny,
and I wish, now, that he hadn't taken it."</p>

<p>I lose here for a little while the fragment of direct
narrative, but I perfectly recollect that he used to
describe Saturday night as his great treat. It was a
grand thing to walk home with six shillings in his pocket,
and to look in at the shop-windows and think what it
would buy. Hunt's roasted corn, as a British and
patriotic substitute for coffee, was in great vogue just
then; and the little fellow used to buy it, and roast it
on the Sunday. There was a cheap periodical of selected
pieces called the <i>Portfolio</i>, which he had also a
great fancy for taking home with him. The new proposed
"deed," meanwhile, had failed to propitiate his
father's creditors; all hope of arrangement passed away;
and the end was that his mother and her encampment
in Gower Street north broke up and went to live in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Marshalsea. I am able at this point to resume his own
account:</p>

<p>"The key of the house was sent back to the landlord,
who was very glad to get it; and I (small Cain that I
was, except that I had never done harm to any one)
was handed over as a lodger to a reduced old lady, long
known to our family, in Little College Street, Camden-town,
who took children in to board, and had once
done so at Brighton; and who, with a few alterations
and embellishments, unconsciously began to sit for Mrs.
Pipchin in <i>Dombey</i> when she took in me.</p>

<p>"She had a little brother and sister under her care
then; somebody's natural children, who were very
irregularly paid for; and a widow's little son. The
two boys and I slept in the same room. My own exclusive
breakfast, of a penny cottage loaf and a penny-worth
of milk, I provided for myself. I kept another
small loaf, and a quarter of a pound of cheese, on a
particular shelf of a particular cupboard; to make my
supper on when I came back at night. They made a
hole in the six or seven shillings, I know well; and I
was out at the blacking-warehouse all day, and had to
support myself upon that money all the week. I suppose
my lodging was paid for, by my father. I certainly
did not pay it myself; and I certainly had no
other assistance whatever (the making of my clothes, I
think, excepted), from Monday morning until Saturday
night. No advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no
consolation, no support, from any one that I can call
to mind, so help me God.</p>

<p>"Sundays, Fanny and I passed in the prison. I was
at the academy in Tenterden Street, Hanover Square,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
at nine o'clock in the morning, to fetch her; and we
walked back there together, at night.</p>

<p>"I was so young and childish, and so little qualified&mdash;how
could I be otherwise?&mdash;to undertake the whole
charge of my own existence, that, in going to Hungerford
Stairs of a morning, I could not resist the stale
pastry put out at half-price on trays at the confectioners'
doors in Tottenham Court Road; and I often spent
in that the money I should have kept for my dinner.
Then I went without my dinner, or bought a roll, or a
slice of pudding. There were two pudding-shops between
which I was divided, according to my finances.
One was in a court close to St. Martin's Church (at
the back of the church) which is now removed altogether.
The pudding at that shop was made with currants,
and was rather a special pudding, but was dear:
two penn'orth not being larger than a penn'orth of
more ordinary pudding. A good shop for the latter
was in the Strand, somewhere near where the Lowther
Arcade is now. It was a stout, hale pudding, heavy
and flabby; with great raisins in it, stuck in whole, at
great distances apart. It came up hot, at about noon
every day; and many and many a day did I dine off it.</p>

<p>"We had half an hour, I think, for tea. When I
had money enough, I used to go to a coffee-shop, and
have half a pint of coffee, and a slice of bread-and-butter.
When I had no money, I took a turn in
Covent Garden market, and stared at the pineapples.
The coffee-shops to which I most resorted were, one in
Maiden Lane; one in a court (non-existent now) close
to Hungerford market; and one in St. Martin's Lane,
of which I only recollect that it stood near the church,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and that in the door there was an oval glass plate, with
<span class="smcap">coffee-room</span> painted on it, addressed towards the
street. If I ever find myself in a very different kind
of coffee-room now, but where there is such an inscription
on glass, and read it backward on the wrong side
<span class="smcap">moor-eeffoc</span> (as I often used to do then, in a dismal
reverie,) a shock goes through my blood.</p>

<p>"I know I do not exaggerate, unconsciously and unintentionally,
the scantiness of my resources and the
difficulties of my life. I know that if a shilling or so
were given me by any one, I spent it in a dinner or a
tea. I know that I worked, from morning to night,
with common men and boys, a shabby child. I know
that I tried, but ineffectually, not to anticipate my
money, and to make it last the week through; by putting
it away in a drawer I had in the counting-house,
wrapped into six little parcels, each parcel containing
the same amount and labeled with a different day. I
know that I have lounged about the streets, insufficiently
and unsatisfactorily fed. I know that, but for the mercy
of God, I might easily have been, for any care that was
taken of me, a little robber or a little vagabond.</p>

<p>"But I held some station at the blacking-warehouse
too. Besides that my relative at the counting-house did
what a man so occupied, and dealing with a thing so
anomalous, could, to treat me as one upon a different
footing from the rest, I never said, to man or boy, how
it was that I came to be there, or gave the least indication
of being sorry that I was there. That I suffered
in secret, and that I suffered exquisitely, no one ever
knew but I. How much I suffered, it is, as I have
said already, utterly beyond my power to tell. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
man's imagination can overstep the reality. But I kept
my own counsel, and I did my work. I knew from the
first that, if I could not do my work as well as any of
the rest, I could not hold myself above slight and contempt.
I soon became at least as expeditious and as
skillful with my hands as either of the other boys.
Though perfectly familiar with them, my conduct and
manners were different enough from theirs to place a
space between us. They, and the men, always spoke
of me as 'the young gentleman.' A certain man (a
soldier once) named Thomas, who was the foreman, and
another named Harry, who was the carman and wore a
red jacket, used to call me 'Charles' sometimes, in
speaking to me; but I think it was mostly when we were
very confidential, and when I had made some efforts to
entertain them over our work with the results of some
of the old readings, which were fast perishing out of
my mind. Poll Green uprose once, and rebelled
against the 'young gentleman' usage; but Bob Fagin
settled him speedily.</p>

<p>"My rescue from this kind of existence I considered
quite hopeless, and abandoned as such, altogether;
though I am solemnly convinced that I never, for one
hour, was reconciled to it, or was otherwise than miserably
unhappy. I felt keenly, however, the being so
cut off from my parents, my brothers and sisters, and,
when my day's work was done, going home to such a
miserable blank; and <i>that</i>, I thought, might be corrected.
One Sunday night I remonstrated with my
father on this head, so pathetically, and with so many
tears, that his kind nature gave way. He began to
think that it was not quite right. I do believe he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
had never thought so before, or thought about it. It
was the first remonstrance I had ever made about my
lot, and perhaps it opened up a little more than I intended.
A back-attic was found for me at the house of
an insolvent-court agent, who lived in Lant Street in
the borough, where Bob Sawyer lodged many years afterwards.
A bed and bedding were sent over for me, and
made up on the floor. The little window had a pleasant
prospect of a timber-yard; and when I took possession
of my new abode I thought it was a Paradise."</p>

<p>There is here another blank, which it is, however,
not difficult to supply from letters and recollections of
my own. What was to him of course the great pleasure
of his paradise of a lodging was its bringing him again,
though after a fashion sorry enough, within the circle
of home. From this time he used to breakfast "at
home,"&mdash;in other words, in the Marshalsea; going to
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 't'">it</ins> as early as the gates were open, and for the most part
much earlier. They had no want of bodily comforts
there. His father's income, still going on, was amply
sufficient for that; and in every respect indeed but
elbow-room, I have heard him say, the family lived
more comfortably in prison than they had done for a
long time out of it. They were waited on still by the
maid-of-all-work from Bayham Street, the orphan girl
of the Chatham workhouse, from whose sharp little
worldly and also kindly ways he took his first impression
of the Marchioness in the <i>Old Curiosity Shop</i>. She also
had a lodging in the neighborhood, that she might be
early on the scene of her duties; and when Charles met
her, as he would do occasionally, in his lounging-place
by London Bridge, he would occupy the time before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the gates opened by telling her quite astonishing fictions
about the wharves and the tower. "But I hope I believed
them myself," he would say. Besides breakfast,
he had supper also in the prison, and got to his lodging
generally at nine o'clock. The gates closed always at
ten.</p>

<p>I must not omit what he told me of the landlord of
this little lodging. He was a fat, good-natured, kind
old gentleman. He was lame, and had a quiet old
wife; and he had a very innocent grown-up son, who
was lame too. They were all very kind to the boy.
He was taken with one of his old attacks of spasm one
night, and the whole three of them were about his bed
until morning. They were all dead when he told me
this; but in another form they still live very pleasantly
as the Garland family in the <i>Old Curiosity Shop</i>.</p>

<p>He had a similar illness one day in the warehouse,
which I can describe in his own words: "Bob Fagin
was very good to me on the occasion of a bad attack
of my old disorder. I suffered such excruciating pain
that time, that they made a temporary bed of straw in
my old recess in the counting-house, and I rolled about
on the floor, and Bob filled empty blacking-bottles with
hot water, and applied relays of them to my side, half
the day. I got better, and quite easy towards evening;
but Bob (who was much bigger and older than I) did
not like the idea of my going home alone, and took me
under his protection. I was too proud to let him know
about the prison, and, after making several efforts to
get rid of him, to all of which Bob Fagin in his goodness
was deaf, shook hands with him on the steps of
a house near Southwark Bridge on the Surrey side,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
making believe that I lived there. As a finishing piece
of reality in case of his looking back, I knocked at the
door, I recollect, and asked, when the woman opened
it, if that was Mr. Robert Fagin's house."</p>

<p>The Saturday nights continued, as before, to be precious
to him. "My usual way home was over Blackfriars
Bridge, and down that turning in the Blackfriars
Road which has Rowland Hill's chapel on one side, and
the likeness of a golden dog licking a golden pot over a
shop-door on the other. There are a good many little
low-browed old shops in that street, of a wretched kind;
and some are unchanged now. I looked into one a few
weeks ago, where I used to buy boot-laces on Saturday
nights, and saw the corner where I once sat down on a
stool to have a pair of ready-made half-boots fitted on.
I have been seduced more than once, in that street on
a Saturday night, by a show-van at a corner; and have
gone in, with a very motley assemblage, to see the Fat-pig,
the Wild-indian, and the Little-lady. There were
two or three hat-manufactories there then (I think they
are there still); and among the things which, encountered
anywhere or under any circumstances, will instantly
recall that time, is the smell of hat-making."</p>

<p>His father's attempts to avoid going through the
court having failed, all needful ceremonies had to be
undertaken to obtain the benefit of the insolvent debtors'
act; and in one of these little Charles had his part to
play. One condition of the statute was that the wearing-apparel
and personal matters retained were not to
exceed twenty pounds sterling in value. "It was necessary,
as a matter of form, that the clothes I wore should
be seen by the official appraiser. I had a half-holiday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to enable me to call upon him, at his own time, at a
house somewhere beyond the Obelisk. I recollect his
coming out to look at me with his mouth full, and a
strong smell of beer upon him, and saying good-naturedly
that 'that would do,' and 'it was all right.'
Certainly the hardest creditor would not have been disposed
(even if he had been legally entitled) to avail
himself of my poor white hat, little jacket, or corduroy
trowsers. But I had a fat old silver watch in my pocket,
which had been given me by my grandmother before
the blacking-days, and I had entertained my doubts as
I went along whether that valuable possession might
not bring me over the twenty pounds. So I was greatly
relieved, and made him a bow of acknowledgment as I
went out."</p>

<p>Still, the want felt most by him was the companionship
of boys of his own age. He had no such acquaintance.
Sometimes he remembered to have played on
the coal-barges at dinner-time, with Poll Green and
Bob Fagin; but those were rare occasions. He generally
strolled alone, about the back streets of the
Adelphi, or explored the Adelphi arches. One of his
favorite localities was a little public-house by the water-side,
called the Fox-under-the-hill, approached by an
underground passage which we once missed in looking
for it together; and he had a vision which he has mentioned
in <i>Copperfield</i> of sitting eating something on a
bench outside, one fine evening, and looking at some
coal-heavers dancing before the house. "I wonder
what they thought of me," says David. He had himself
already said the same in his fragment of autobiography.</p>

<p>Another characteristic little incident he made afterwards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
one of David's experiences, but I am able to
give it here without the disguises that adapt it to the
fiction: "I was such a little fellow, with my poor
white hat, little jacket, and corduroy trowsers, that
frequently, when I went into the bar of a strange
public-house for a glass of ale or porter to wash down
the saveloy and the loaf I had eaten in the street, they
didn't like to give it me. I remember, one evening
(I had been somewhere for my father, and was going
back to the borough over Westminster Bridge), that I
went into a public-house in Parliament Street,&mdash;which
is still there, though altered,&mdash;at the corner of the
short street leading into Cannon Row, and said to
the landlord behind the bar, 'What is your very best&mdash;the
VERY <i>best</i>&mdash;ale, a glass?' For the occasion was a
festive one, for some reason: I forget why. It may
have been my birthday, or somebody else's. 'Two-pence,'
says he. 'Then,' says I, 'just draw me a glass
of that, if you please, with a good head to it.' The
landlord looked at me, in return, over the bar, from
head to foot, with a strange smile on his face, and,
instead of drawing the beer, looked round the screen
and said something to his wife, who came out from
behind it, with her work in her hand, and joined him
in surveying me. Here we stand, all three, before me
now, in my study in Devonshire Terrace. The landlord,
in his shirt-sleeves, leaning against the bar window-frame;
his wife, looking over the little half-door;
and I, in some confusion, looking up at them from
outside the partition. They asked me a good many
questions, as what my name was, how old I was, where
I lived, how I was employed, etc. etc. To all of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
which, that I might commit nobody, I invented appropriate
answers. They served me with the ale, though
I suspect it was not the strongest on the premises; and
the landlord's wife, opening the little half-door and
bending down, gave me a kiss that was half admiring
and half compassionate, but all womanly and good, I
am sure."</p>

<p>A later, and not less characteristic, incident of the
true story of this time found also a place, three or four
years after it was written, in his now famous fiction.
It preceded but by a short time the discharge, from the
Marshalsea, of the elder Dickens; to whom a rather
considerable legacy from a relative had accrued not
long before ("some hundreds," I understood), and
had been paid into court during his imprisonment.
The scene to be described arose on the occasion of a
petition drawn up by him before he left, praying, not
for the abolition of imprisonment for debt, as David
Copperfield relates, but for the less dignified but more
accessible boon of a bounty to the prisoners to drink
his majesty's health on his majesty's forthcoming birthday.</p>

<p>"I mention the circumstance because it illustrates, to
me, my early interest in observing people. When I
went to the Marshalsea of a night, I was always delighted
to hear from my mother what she knew about
the histories of the different debtors in the prison; and
when I heard of this approaching ceremony, I was so
anxious to see them all come in, one after another
(though I knew the greater part of them already, to
speak to, and they me), that I got leave of absence on
purpose, and established myself in a corner, near the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
petition. It was stretched out, I recollect, on a great
ironing-board, under the window, which in another part
of the room made a bedstead at night. The internal
regulations of the place, for cleanliness and order, and
for the government of a common room in the ale-house,
where hot water and some means of cooking, and a good
fire, were provided for all who paid a very small subscription,
were excellently administered by a governing
committee of debtors, of which my father was chairman
for the time being. As many of the principal officers
of this body as could be got into the small room without
filling it up, supported him, in front of the petition;
and my old friend Captain Porter (who had washed
himself, to do honor to so solemn an occasion) stationed
himself close to it, to read it to all who were unacquainted
with its contents. The door was then thrown
open, and they began to come in, in a long file; several
waiting on the landing outside, while one entered, affixed
his signature, and went out. To everybody in
succession, Captain Porter said, 'Would you like to
hear it read?' If he weakly showed the least disposition
to hear it, Captain Porter, in a loud sonorous
voice, gave him every word of it. I remember a certain
luscious roll he gave to such words as 'Majesty&mdash;gracious
Majesty&mdash;your gracious Majesty's unfortunate
subjects&mdash;your Majesty's well-known munificence,'&mdash;as
if the words were something real in his mouth, and
delicious to taste; my poor father meanwhile listening
with a little of an author's vanity, and contemplating
(not severely) the spikes on the opposite wall. Whatever
was comical in this scene, and whatever was pathetic,
I sincerely believe I perceived in my corner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
whether I demonstrated or not, quite as well as I should
perceive it now. I made out my own little character
and story for every man who put his name to the sheet
of paper. I might be able to do that now, more truly:
not more earnestly, or with a closer interest. Their
different peculiarities of dress, of face, of gait, of manner,
were written indelibly upon my memory. I would
rather have seen it than the best play ever played; and
I thought about it afterwards, over the pots of paste-blacking,
often and often. When I looked, with my
mind's eye, into the Fleet prison during Mr. Pickwick's
incarceration, I wonder whether half a dozen
men were wanting from the Marshalsea crowd that
came filing in again, to the sound of Captain Porter's
voice!"</p>

<p>When the family left the Marshalsea they all went to
lodge with the lady in Little College Street, a Mrs. Roylance,
who has obtained unexpected immortality as Mrs.
Pipchin; and they afterwards occupied a small house in
Somers-town. But, before this time, Charles was present
with some of them in Tenterden Street to see his sister.
Fanny received one of the prizes given to the pupils of
the Royal Academy of Music. "I could not bear to
think of myself&mdash;beyond the reach of all such honorable
emulation and success. The tears ran down my
face. I felt as if my heart were rent. I prayed, when
I went to bed that night, to be lifted out of the humiliation
and neglect in which I was. I never had suffered
so much before. There was no envy in this." There
was little need that he should say so. Extreme enjoyment
in witnessing the exercise of her talents, the
utmost pride in every success obtained by them, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
manifested always to a degree otherwise quite unusual
with him; and on the day of her funeral, which we
passed together, I had most affecting proof of his tender
and grateful memory of her in these childish days. A
few more sentences, certainly not less touching than
any that have gone before, will bring the story of them
to its close. They stand here exactly as written by
him:</p>

<p>"I am not sure that it was before this time, or after
it, that the blacking-warehouse was removed to Chandos
Street, Covent Garden. It is no matter. Next to
the shop at the corner of Bedford Street in Chandos
Street are two rather old-fashioned houses and shops
adjoining one another. They were one then, or thrown
into one, for the blacking-business; and had been a
butter-shop. Opposite to them was, and is, a public-house,
where I got my ale, under these new circumstances.
The stones in the street may be smoothed by
my small feet going across to it at dinner-time, and
back again. The establishment was larger now, and
we had one or two new boys. Bob Fagin and I had
attained to great dexterity in tying up the pots. I
forget how many we could do in five minutes. We
worked, for the light's sake, near the second window
as you come from Bedford Street; and we were so
brisk at it that the people used to stop and look in.
Sometimes there would be quite a little crowd there.
I saw my father coming in at the door one day when
we were very busy, and I wondered how he could
bear it.</p>

<p>"Now, I generally had my dinner in the warehouse.
Sometimes I brought it from home, so I was better off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
I see myself coming across Russell Square from Somers-town,
one morning, with some cold hotch-potch in
a small basin tied up in a handkerchief. I had the
same wanderings about the streets as I used to have, and
was just as solitary and self-dependent as before; but I
had not the same difficulty in merely living. I never,
however, heard a word of being taken away, or of
being otherwise than quite provided for.</p>

<p>"At last, one day, my father, and the relative so
often mentioned, quarreled; quarreled by letter, for I
took the letter from my father to him which caused the
explosion, but quarreled very fiercely. It was about
me. It may have had some backward reference, in
part, for anything I know, to my employment at the
window. All I am certain of is, that, soon after I had
given him the letter, my cousin (he was a sort of cousin,
by marriage) told me he was very much insulted about
me, and that it was impossible to keep me after that.
I cried very much, partly because it was so sudden, and
partly because in his anger he was violent about my
father, though gentle to me. Thomas, the old soldier,
comforted me, and said he was sure it was for the best.
With a relief so strange that it was like oppression, I
went home.</p>

<p>"My mother set herself to accommodate the quarrel,
and did so next day. She brought home a request for
me to return next morning, and a high character of me,
which I am very sure I deserved. My father said I
should go back no more, and should go to school. I
do not write resentfully or angrily; for I know how all
these things have worked together to make me what I
am; but I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my
being sent back.</p>

<p>"From that hour until this at which I write, no word
of that part of my childhood which I have now gladly
brought to a close has passed my lips to any human
being. I have no idea how long it lasted; whether for
a year, or much more, or less. From that hour until
this my father and my mother have been stricken dumb
upon it. I have never heard the least allusion to it,
however far off and remote, from either of them. I have
never, until I now impart it to this paper, in any burst
of confidence with any one, my own wife not excepted,
raised the curtain I then dropped, thank God.</p>

<p>"Until old Hungerford market was pulled down,
until old Hungerford Stairs were destroyed, and the
very nature of the ground changed, I never had the
courage to go back to the place where my servitude
began. I never saw it. I could not endure to go near
it. For many years, when I came near to Robert
Warren's in the Strand, I crossed over to the opposite
side of the way, to avoid a certain smell of the cement
they put upon the blacking-corks, which reminded me
of what I was once. It was a very long time before I
liked to go up Chandos Street. My old way home by
the borough made me cry, after my eldest child could
speak.</p>

<p>"In my walks at night I have walked there often,
since then, and by degrees I have come to write this.
It does not seem a tithe of what I might have written,
or of what I meant to write."</p>

<p>The substance of some after-talk explanatory of
points in the narrative, of which a note was made at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the time, may be briefly added. He could hardly have
been more than twelve years old when he left the place,
and was still unusually small for his age; much smaller,
though two years older, than his own eldest son was at
the time of these confidences. His mother had been
in the blacking-warehouse many times; his father not
more than once or twice. The rivalry of Robert Warren
by Jonathan's representatives, the cousins George
and James, was carried to wonderful extremes in the
way of advertisement; and they were all very proud, he
told me, of the cat scratching the boot, which was <i>their</i>
house's device. The poets in the house's regular employ
he remembered, too, and made his first study from
one of them for the poet of Mrs. Jarley's wax-work.
The whole enterprise, however, had the usual end of
such things. The younger cousin tired of the concern;
and a Mr. Wood, the proprietor who took James's
share and became George's partner, sold it ultimately
to Robert Warren. It continued to be his at the time
Dickens and myself last spoke of it together, and he
had made an excellent bargain of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> what way these strange experiences of his boyhood
affected him afterwards, this narrative of his life
must show; but there were influences that made themselves
felt even on his way to manhood.</p>

<p>What at once he brought out of the humiliation that
had impressed him so deeply, though scarcely as yet
quite consciously, was a natural dread of the hardships
that might still be in store for him, sharpened by what
he had gone through; and this, though in its effect for
the present imperfectly understood, became by degrees
a passionate resolve, even while he was yielding to circumstances,
<i>not to be</i> what circumstances were conspiring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to make him. All that was involved in what he
had suffered and sunk into, could not have been known
to him at the time; but it was plain enough later, as
we see; and in conversation with me after the revelation
was made, he used to find, at extreme points in
his life, the explanation of himself in those early trials.
He had derived great good from them, but not without
alloy. The fixed and eager determination, the restless
and resistless energy, which opened to him opportunities
of escape from many mean environments, not
by turning off from any path of duty, but by resolutely
rising to such excellence or distinction as might be
attainable in it, brought with it some disadvantage
among many noble advantages. Of this he was himself
aware, but not to the full extent. What it was
that in society made him often uneasy, shrinking, and
over-sensitive, he knew; but all the danger he ran in
bearing down and overmastering the feeling, he did
not know. A too great confidence in himself, a sense
that everything was possible to the will that would
make it so, laid occasionally upon him self-imposed
burdens greater than might be borne by any one with
safety. In that direction there was in him, at such
times, something even hard and aggressive; in his determinations
a something that had almost the tone of
fierceness; something in his nature that made his
resolves insuperable, however hasty the opinions on
which they had been formed. So rare were these manifestations,
however, and so little did they prejudice a
character as entirely open and generous as it was at all
times ardent and impetuous, that only very infrequently,
towards the close of the middle term of a friendship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
which lasted without the interruption of a day for more
than three-and-thirty years, were they ever unfavorably
presented to me. But there they were; and when I
have seen strangely present, at such chance intervals, a
stern and even cold isolation of self-reliance side by
side with a susceptivity almost feminine and the most
eager craving for sympathy, it has seemed to me as
though his habitual impulses for everything kind and
gentle had sunk, for the time, under a sudden hard
and inexorable sense of what fate had dealt to him in
those early years. On more than one occasion, indeed,
I had confirmation of this. "I must entreat you,"
he wrote to me in June, 1862, "to pause for an instant,
and go back to what you know of my childish days,
and to ask yourself whether it is natural that something
of the character formed in me then, and lost under
happier circumstances, should have reappeared in the
last five years. The never-to-be-forgotten misery of
that old time bred a certain shrinking sensitiveness in
a certain ill-clad ill-fed child, that I have found come
back in the never-to-be-forgotten misery of this later
time."</p>

<p>One good there was, however, altogether without
drawback, and which claims simply to be mentioned
before my narrative is resumed. The story of his
childish misery has itself sufficiently shown that he
never throughout it lost his precious gift of animal
spirits, or his native capacity for humorous enjoyment;
and there were positive gains to him from what he underwent,
which were also rich and lasting. To what in
the outset of his difficulties and trials gave the decisive
bent to his genius, I have already made special reference;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and we are to observe, of what followed, that
with the very poor and unprosperous, out of whose
sufferings and strugglings, and the virtues as well as
vices born of them, his not least splendid successes were
wrought, his childish experiences had made him actually
one. They were not his clients whose cause he pleaded
with such pathos and humor, and on whose side he got
the laughter and tears of all the world, but in some sort
his very self. Nor was it a small part of this manifest
advantage that he should have obtained his experience
as a child and not as a man; that only the good part,
the flower and fruit of it, was plucked by him; and
that nothing of the evil part, none of the earth in which
the seed was planted, remained to soil him.</p>

<p>His next move in life can also be given in his own language:
"There was a school in the Hampstead Road
kept by Mr. Jones, a Welshman, to which my father
dispatched me to ask for a card of terms. The boys
were at dinner, and Mr. Jones was carving for them
with a pair of holland sleeves on, when I acquitted
myself of this commission. He came out, and gave me
what I wanted; and hoped I should become a pupil.
I did. At seven o'clock one morning, very soon
afterwards, I went as day-scholar to Mr. Jones's establishment,
which was in Mornington Place, and had its
school-room sliced away by the Birmingham Railway,
when that change came about. The school-room, however,
was not threatened by directors or civil engineers
then, and there was a board over the door, graced with
the words <span class="smcap">Wellington House Academy</span>."</p>

<p>At Wellington House Academy he remained nearly
two years, being a little over fourteen years of age when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
he quitted it. In his minor writings as well as in
<i>Copperfield</i> will be found general allusions to it, and
there is a paper among his pieces reprinted from <i>Household
Words</i> which purports specifically to describe it.
To the account therein given of himself when he went
to the school, as advanced enough, so safely had his
memory retained its poor fragments of early schooling,
to be put into <i>Virgil</i>, as getting sundry prizes, and as
attaining to the eminent position of its first boy, one of
his two schoolfellows with whom I have had communication
makes objection; but both admit that the
general features of the place are reproduced with wonderful
accuracy, and more especially in those points for
which the school appears to have been much more
notable than for anything connected with the scholarship
of its pupils.</p>

<p>In the reprinted piece Dickens describes it as remarkable
for white mice. He says that red-polls, linnets,
and even canaries were kept by the boys in desks,
drawers, hat-boxes, and other strange refuges for birds;
but that white mice were the favorite stock, and that
the boys trained the mice much better than the master
trained the boys. He recalled in particular one white
mouse who lived in the cover of a Latin dictionary,
ran up ladders, drew Roman chariots, shouldered
muskets, turned wheels, and even made a very creditable
appearance on the stage as the dog of Mont&agrave;rgis,
who might have achieved greater things but for having
had the misfortune to mistake his way in a triumphal
procession to the Capitol, when he fell into a deep inkstand
and was dyed black and drowned.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he mentions the school as one also of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
some celebrity in its neighborhood, though nobody
could have said why; and adds that among the boys
the master was supposed to know nothing, and one of
the ushers was supposed to know everything. "We
are still inclined to think the first-named supposition
perfectly correct. We went to look at the place only
this last midsummer, and found that the railway had
cut it up, root and branch. A great trunk line had
swallowed the playground, sliced away the school-room,
and pared off the corner of the house. Which, thus
curtailed of its proportions, presented itself in a green
stage of stucco, profile-wise towards the road, like a
forlorn flat-iron without a handle, standing on end."</p>

<p>One who knew him in those early days, Mr. Owen
P. Thomas, thus writes to me (February, 1871): "I
had the honor of being Mr. Dickens's schoolfellow for
about two years (1824-1826), both being day-scholars,
at Mr. Jones's 'Classical and Commercial Academy,'
as then inscribed in front of the house, and which was
situated at the corner of Granby Street and the Hampstead
Road. The house stands now in its original state,
but the school and large playground behind disappeared
on the formation of the London and Northwestern
Railway, which at this point runs in a slanting direction
from Euston Square underneath the Hampstead
Road. We were all companions and playmates when
out of school, as well as fellow-students therein." (Mr.
Thomas includes in this remark the names of Henry
Danson, now a physician in practice in London; of
Daniel Tobin, whom I remember to have been frequently
assisted by his old schoolfellow in later years;
and of Richard Bray.) "You will find a graphic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
sketch of the school by Mr. Dickens himself in <i>Household
Words</i> of 11th October, 1851. The article is
entitled Our School. The names of course are feigned;
but, allowing for slight coloring, the persons and incidents
described are all true to life, and easily recognizable
by any one who attended the school at the time.
The Latin master was Mr. Manville, or Mandeville,
who for many years was well known at the library of
the British Museum. The academy, after the railroad
overthrew it, was removed to another house in the
neighborhood, but Mr. Jones and two at least of his
assistant masters have long ago departed this life."</p>

<p>One of the latter was the usher believed to know
everything, who was writing-master, mathematical master,
English master, divided the little boys with the
Latin master, made out the bills, mended the pens, and
always called at parents' houses to inquire after sick boys,
because he had gentlemanly manners. This picture my
correspondent recognized; as well as those of the fat
little dancing-master who taught them hornpipes, of the
Latin master who stuffed his ears with onions for his
deafness, of the gruff serving-man who nursed the boys
in scarlet fever, and of the principal himself, who was
always ruling ciphering-books with a bloated mahogany
ruler, smiting the palms of offenders with the same
diabolical instrument, or viciously drawing a pair of
pantaloons tight with one of his large hands and caning
the wearer with the other.</p>

<p>"My recollection of Dickens whilst at school," Mr.
Thomas continues, "is that of a healthy-looking boy,
small but well built, with a more than usual flow of
spirits, inducing to harmless fun, seldom or never I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
think to mischief, to which so many lads at that age are
prone. I cannot recall anything that then indicated he
would hereafter become a literary celebrity; but perhaps
he was too young then. He usually held his head more
erect than lads ordinarily do, and there was a general
smartness about him. His weekday dress of jacket and
trowsers, I can clearly remember, was what is called
pepper-and-salt; and, instead of the frill that most boys
of his age wore then, he had a turn-down collar, so that
he looked less youthful in consequence. He invented
what we termed a 'lingo,' produced by the addition of
a few letters of the same sound to every word; and it
was our ambition, walking and talking thus along the
street, to be considered foreigners. As an alternate
amusement the present writer well remembers extemporizing
tales of some sort, and reciting them offhand,
with Dickens and Danson or Tobin walking on either
side of him. I inclose you a copy of a note I received
from him when he was between thirteen and fourteen
years of age, perhaps one of the earliest productions of
his pen. The Leg referred to was the Legend of something,
a pamphlet romance I had lent him; the Clavis
was of course the Latin school-book so named."</p>

<p>There is some underlying whim or fun in the "Leg"
allusions which Mr. Thomas appears to have overlooked,
and certainly fails to explain; but the note, which is
here given in fac-simile, may be left to speak for itself;
and in the signature the reader will be amused to see
the first faint beginning of a flourish afterwards famous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>"After a lapse of years," Mr. Thomas continues,
"I recognized the celebrated writer as the individual
I had known so well as a boy, from having preserved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
this note; and upon Mr. Dickens visiting Reading in
December, 1854, to give one of his earliest readings
for the benefit of the literary institute, of which he had
become president on Mr. Justice Talfourd's death, I
took the opportunity of showing it to him, when he
was much diverted therewith. On the same occasion
we conversed about mutual schoolfellows, and among
others Daniel Tobin was referred to, whom I remembered
to have been Dickens's <i>most</i> intimate companion
in the school-days (1824 to 1826). His reply was that
Tobin either was then, or had previously been, assisting
him in the capacity of amanuensis; but there is a
subsequent mystery about Tobin, in connection with
his friend and patron, which I have never been able to
comprehend; for I understood shortly afterwards that
there was entire separation between them, and it must
have been an offense of some gravity to have sundered
an acquaintance formed in early youth, and which had
endured, greatly to Tobin's advantage, so long. He
resided in our school-days in one of the now old and
grimy-looking stone-fronted houses in George Street,
Euston Road, a few doors from the Orange-tree tavern.
It is the opinion of the other schoolfellow with whom
we were intimate, Doctor Danson, that upon leaving
school Mr. Dickens and Tobin entered the same solicitor's
office, and this he thinks was either in or near
Lincoln's Inn Fields."</p>



<p>The offense of Tobin went no deeper than the having
at last worn out even Dickens's patience and kindness.
His applications for relief were so incessantly
repeated, that to cut him and them adrift altogether
was the only way of escape from what had become an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
intolerable nuisance. To Mr. Thomas's letter the
reader will thank me for adding one not less interesting
with which Dr. Henry Danson has favored me.
We have here, with the same fun and animal spirits, a
little of the proneness to mischief which his other
schoolfellow says he was free from; but the mischief
is all of the harmless kind, and might perhaps
have been better described as but part of an irrepressible
vivacity:</p>

<p>"My impression is that I was a schoolfellow of
Dickens for nearly two years: he left before me, I
think at about fifteen years of age. Mr. Jones's school,
called the Wellington Academy, was in the Hampstead
Road, at the northeast corner of Granby Street.
The school-house was afterwards removed for the London
and Northwestern Railway. It was considered at
the time a very superior sort of school,&mdash;one of the
best, indeed, in that part of London; but it was
most shamefully mismanaged, and the boys made but
very little progress. The proprietor, Mr. Jones, was
a Welshman; a most ignorant fellow, and a mere
tyrant; whose chief employment was to scourge the
boys. Dickens has given a very lively account of
this place in his paper entitled Our School, but it is
very mythical in many respects, and more especially
in the compliment he pays in it to himself. I do not
remember that Dickens distinguished himself in any
way, or carried off any prizes. My belief is that he
did not learn Greek or Latin there; and you will
remember there is no allusion to the classics in any
of his writings. He was a handsome, curly-headed
lad, full of animation and animal spirits, and probably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was connected with every mischievous prank in the
school. I do not think he came in for any of Mr.
Jones's scourging propensity: in fact, together with
myself, he was only a day-pupil, and with these there
was a wholesome fear of tales being carried home to
the parents. His personal appearance at that time is
vividly brought home to me in the portrait of him
taken a few years later by Mr. Lawrence. He resided
with his friends in a very small house in a street leading
out of Seymour Street, north of Mr. Judkin's
chapel.</p>

<p>"Depend on it, he was quite a self-made man, and
his wonderful knowledge and command of the English
language must have been acquired by long and
patient study after leaving his last school.</p>

<p>"I have no recollection of the boy you name. His
chief associates were, I think, Tobin, Mr. Thomas,
Bray, and myself. The first-named was his chief ally,
and his acquaintance with him appears to have continued
many years afterwards. At about that time
Penny and Saturday Magazines were published weekly,
and were greedily read by us. We kept bees, white
mice, and other living things clandestinely in our
desks; and the mechanical arts were a good deal
cultivated, in the shape of coach-building, and making
pumps and boats, the motive power of which was
the white mice.</p>

<p>"I think at that time Dickens took to writing small
tales, and we had a sort of club for lending and circulating
them. Dickens was also very strong in using a
sort of lingo, which made us quite unintelligible to
bystanders. We were very strong, too, in theatricals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
We mounted small theatres, and got up very gorgeous
scenery to illustrate the <i>Miller and his Men</i> and <i>Cherry
and Fair Star</i>. I remember the present Mr. Beverley,
the scene-painter, assisted us in this. Dickens was
always a leader at these plays, which were occasionally
presented with much solemnity before an audience of
boys and in the presence of the ushers. My brother,
assisted by Dickens, got up the <i>Miller and his Men</i>, in
a very gorgeous form. Master Beverley constructed
the mill for us in such a way that it could tumble to
pieces with the assistance of crackers. At one representation
the fireworks in the last scene, ending with
the destruction of the mill, were so very real that the
police interfered and knocked violently at the doors.
Dickens's after-taste for theatricals might have had its
origin in these small affairs.</p>

<p>"I quite remember Dickens on one occasion heading
us in Drummond Street in pretending to be poor boys,
and asking the passers-by for charity,&mdash;especially old
ladies, one of whom told us she 'had no money for
beggar-boys.' On these adventures, when the old ladies
were quite staggered by the impudence of the demand,
Dickens would explode with laughter and take to his
heels.</p>

<p>"I met him one Sunday morning shortly after he
left the school, and we very piously attended the morning
service at Seymour Street Chapel. I am sorry to
say Master Dickens did not attend in the slightest degree
to the service, but incited me to laughter by
declaring his dinner was ready and the potatoes would
be spoiled, and in fact behaved in such a manner that
it was lucky for us we were not ejected from the chapel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"I heard of him some time after from Tobin, whom
I met carrying a foaming pot of London particular in
Lincoln's Inn Fields, and I then understood that
Dickens was in the same or some neighboring office.</p>

<p>"Many years elapsed after this before I became aware,
from accidentally reading Our School, that the brilliant
and now famous Dickens was my old schoolfellow. I
didn't like to intrude myself upon him; and it was not
until three or four years ago, when he presided at the
University College dinner at Willis's rooms, and made
a most brilliant and effective speech, that I sent him a
congratulatory note reminding him of our former fellowship.
To this he sent me a kind note in reply, and
which I value very much. I send you copies of these."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>From Dickens himself I never heard much allusion to
the school thus described; but I knew that, besides
being the subject dealt with in <i>Household Words</i>, it had
supplied some of the lighter traits of Salem House for
<i>Copperfield;</i> and that to the fact of one of its tutors
being afterwards engaged to teach a boy of Macready's,
our common friend, Dickens used to point for one of
the illustrations of his favorite theory as to the smallness
of the world, and how things and persons apparently
the most unlikely to meet were continually
knocking up against each other. The employment as
his amanuensis of his schoolfellow Tobin dates as early
as his Doctors'-Commons days, but both my correspondents
are mistaken in the impression they appear
to have received that Tobin had been previously his
fellow-clerk in the same attorney's office. I had thought
him more likely to have been accompanied there by
another of his boyish acquaintances who became afterwards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a solicitor, Mr. Mitton, not recollected by either
of my correspondents in connection with the school,
but whom I frequently met with him in later years, and
for whom he had the regard arising out of such early
associations. In this, however, I have since discovered
my own mistake: the truth being that it was this gentleman's
connection, not with the Wellington Academy,
but with a school kept by Mr. Dawson in Hunter Street,
Brunswick Square, where the brothers of Dickens were
subsequently placed, which led to their early knowledge
of each other. I fancy that they were together
also, for a short time, at Mr. Molloy's in New Square,
Lincoln's Inn; but, whether or not this was so, Dickens
certainly had not quitted school many months
before his father had made sufficient interest with an
attorney of Gray's Inn, Mr. Edward Blackmore, to
obtain him regular employment in his office. In this
capacity of clerk, our only trustworthy glimpse of him
we owe to the last-named gentleman, who has described
briefly, and I do not doubt authentically, the services
so rendered by him to the law. It cannot be said that
they were noteworthy, though it might be difficult to
find a more distinguished person who has borne the
title, unless we make exception for the very father of
literature himself, whom Chaucer, with amusing illustration
of the way in which words change their meanings,
calls "that conceited clerke Hom&egrave;re."</p>

<p>"I was well acquainted," writes Mr. Edward Blackmore
of Alresford, "with his parents, and, being then
in practice in Gray's Inn, they asked me if I could find
employment for him. He was a bright, clever-looking
youth, and I took him as a clerk. He came to me in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
May, 1827, and left in November, 1828; and I have
now an account-book which he used to keep of petty
disbursements in the office, in which he charged himself
with the modest salary first of thirteen shillings
and sixpence, and afterwards of fifteen shillings, a week.
Several incidents took place in the office of which he
must have been a keen observer, as I recognized some
of them in his <i>Pickwick</i> and <i>Nickleby;</i> and I am much
mistaken if some of his characters had not their originals
in persons I well remember. His taste for theatricals
was much promoted by a fellow-clerk named
Potter, since dead, with whom he chiefly associated.
They took every opportunity, then unknown to me, of
going together to a minor theatre, where (I afterwards
heard) they not unfrequently engaged in parts. After
he left me I saw him at times in the lord chancellor's
court, taking notes of cases as a reporter. I then lost
sight of him until his <i>Pickwick</i> made its appearance."
This letter indicates the position he held at Mr. Blackmore's;
and we have but to turn to the passage in <i>Pickwick</i>
which describes the several grades of attorney's
clerk, to understand it more clearly. He was very far
below the articled clerk, who has paid a premium and
is attorney in perspective. He was not so high as the
salaried clerk, with nearly the whole of his weekly
thirty shillings spent on his personal pleasures. He was
not even on the level with his middle-aged copying-clerk,
always needy and uniformly shabby. He was simply
among, however his own nature may have lifted him
above, the "office-lads in their first surtouts, who feel
a befitting contempt for boys at day-schools, club as
they go home at night for saveloys and porter, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
think there's nothing like life." Thus far, not more
or less, had he now reached. He was one of the
office-lads, and probably in his first surtout.</p>

<p>But, even thus, the process of education went on,
defying what seemed to interrupt it; and in the amount
of his present equipment for his needs of life, what he
brought from the Wellington House Academy can have
borne but the smallest proportion to his acquirement
at Mr. Blackmore's. Yet to seek to identify, without
help from himself, any passages in his books with those
boyish law-experiences, would be idle and hopeless
enough. In the earliest of his writings, and down
to the very latest, he worked exhaustively the field
which is opened by an attorney's office to a student
of life and manners; but we have not now to deal with
his numerous varieties of the <i>genus</i> clerk drawn thus
for the amusement of others, but with the acquisitions
which at present he was storing up for himself from the
opportunities such offices opened to him. Nor would
it be possible to have better illustrative comment on all
these years than is furnished by his father's reply to a
friend it was now hoped to interest on his behalf, which
more than once I have heard him whimsically, but
good-humoredly, imitate. "Pray, Mr. Dickens, where
was your son educated?" "Why, indeed, sir&mdash;ha!
ha!&mdash;he may be said to have educated himself!" Of
the two kinds of education which Gibbon says that all
men who rise above the common level receive,&mdash;the
first, that of his teachers, and the second, more personal
and more important, <i>his own</i>,&mdash;he had the advantage
only of the last. It nevertheless sufficed for
him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Very nearly another eighteen months were now to be
spent mainly in practical preparation for what he was,
at this time, led finally to choose as an employment
from which a fair income was certain with such talents
as he possessed; his father already having taken to it,
in these latter years, in aid of the family resources. In
his father's house, which was at Hampstead through the
first portion of the Mornington Street school time, then
in the house out of Seymour Street mentioned by Dr.
Danson, and afterwards, upon the elder Dickens going
into the gallery, in Bentinck Street, Manchester Square,
Charles had continued to live; and, influenced doubtless
by the example before him, he took sudden determination
to qualify himself thoroughly for what his
father was lately become, a newspaper parliamentary
reporter. He set resolutely, therefore, to the study of
short-hand; and, for the additional help of such general
information about books as a fairly-educated youth
might be expected to have, as well as to satisfy some
higher personal cravings, he became an assiduous attendant
in the British Museum reading-room. He
would frequently refer to these days as decidedly the
usefulest to himself he had ever passed; and, judging
from the results, they must have been so. No man who
knew him in later years, and talked to him familiarly
of books and things, would have suspected his education
in boyhood, almost entirely self-acquired as it was,
to have been so rambling or hap-hazard as I have here
described it. The secret consisted in this, that, whatever
for the time he had to do, he lifted himself, there
and then, to the level of, and at no time disregarded
the rules that guided the hero of his novel. "Whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all my
heart to do well. What I have devoted myself to, I
have devoted myself to completely. Never to put one
hand to anything on which I could throw my whole
self, and never to affect depreciation of my work,
whatever it was, I find now to have been my golden
rules."</p>

<p>Of the difficulties that beset his short-hand studies,
as well as of what first turned his mind to them, he has
told also something in <i>Copperfield</i>. He had heard that
many men distinguished in various pursuits had begun
life by reporting the debates in parliament, and he was
not deterred by a friend's warning that the mere mechanical
accomplishment for excellence in it might take
a few years to master thoroughly; "a perfect and entire
command of the mystery of short-hand writing and
reading being about equal in difficulty to the mastery
of six languages." Undaunted, he plunged into it,
self-teaching in this as in graver things, and, having
bought Mr. Gurney's half-guinea book, worked steadily
his way through its distractions. "The changes that
were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant
such a thing, and in such another position something
else entirely different; the wonderful vagaries that were
played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that
resulted from marks like flies' legs; the tremendous
effects of a curve in a wrong place; not only troubled
my waking hours, but reappeared before me in my
sleep. When I had groped my way, blindly, through
these difficulties, and had mastered the alphabet, there
then appeared a procession of new horrors, called arbitrary
characters; the most despotic characters I have ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
known; who insisted, for instance, that a thing like the
beginning of a cobweb meant expectation, and that a
pen-and-ink sky-rocket stood for disadvantageous.
When I had fixed these wretches in my mind, I found
that they had driven everything else out of it; then,
beginning again, I forgot them; while I was picking
them up, I dropped the other fragments of the system:
in short, it was almost heart-breaking."</p>

<p>What it was that made it not quite heart-breaking to
the hero of the fiction, its readers know; and something
of the same kind was now to enter into the actual
experience of its writer. First let me say, however,
that after subduing to his wants in marvelously quick
time this unruly and unaccommodating servant of stenography,
what he most desired was still not open to
him. "There never <i>was</i> such a short-hand writer,"
has been often said to me by Mr. Beard, the friend he
first made in that line when he entered the gallery, and
with whom to the close of his life he maintained the
friendliest intercourse. But there was no opening for
him in the gallery yet. He had to pass nearly two
years as a reporter for one of the offices in Doctors'
Commons, practicing in this and the other law courts,
before he became a sharer in parliamentary toils and
triumphs; and what sustained his young hero through
something of the same sort of trial was also his own
support. He too had his Dora, at apparently the same
hopeless elevation; striven for as the one only thing to
be attained, and even more unattainable, for neither
did he succeed nor happily did she die; but the one
idol, like the other, supplying a motive to exertion for
the time, and otherwise opening out to the idolater,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
both in fact and fiction, a highly unsubstantial, happy,
foolish time. I used to laugh and tell him I had no
belief in any but the book Dora, until the incident of
a sudden reappearance of the real one in his life, nearly
six years after <i>Copperfield</i> was written, convinced me
there had been a more actual foundation for those
chapters of his book than I was ready to suppose. Still,
I would hardly admit it, and, that the matter could
possibly affect him then, persisted in a stout refusal to
believe. His reply (1855) throws a little light on this
juvenile part of his career, and I therefore venture to
preserve it:</p>

<p>"I don't quite apprehend what you mean by my
overrating the strength of the feeling of five-and-twenty
years ago. If you mean of my own feeling, and will
only think what the desperate intensity of my nature
is, and that this began when I was Charley's age; that
it excluded every other idea from my mind for four
years, at a time of life when four years are equal to
four times four; and that I went at it with a determination
to overcome all the difficulties, which fairly lifted
me up into that newspaper life, and floated me away
over a hundred men's heads; then you are wrong,
because nothing can exaggerate that. I have positively
stood amazed at myself ever since!&mdash;And so I suffered,
and so worked, and so beat and hammered away at the
maddest romances that ever got into any boy's head and
stayed there, that to see the mere cause of it all, now,
loosens my hold upon myself. Without for a moment
sincerely believing that it would have been better if we
had never got separated, I cannot see the occasion of
so much emotion as I should see any one else. No one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
can imagine in the most distant degree what pain the
recollection gave me in <i>Copperfield</i>. And, just as I can
never open that book as I open any other book, I cannot
see the face (even at four-and-forty), or hear the
voice, without going wandering away over the ashes of
all that youth and hope in the wildest manner." More
and more plainly seen, however, in the light of four-and-forty,
the romance glided visibly away, its work
being fairly done; and at the close of the month following
that in which this letter was written, during
which he had very quietly made a formal call with his
wife at his youthful Dora's house, and contemplated
with a calm equanimity, in the hall, her stuffed favorite
Jip, he began the fiction in which there was a Flora to
set against its predecessor's Dora, both derived from
the same original. The fancy had a comic humor in it
he found it impossible to resist, but it was kindly and
pleasant to the last;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and if the later picture showed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
him plenty to laugh at in this retrospect of his youth,
there was nothing he thought of more tenderly than
the earlier, as long as he was conscious of anything.</p>

Hearty Appreciator.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Dickens</span> was nineteen years old when at last he entered
the gallery. His father, with whom he still lived
in Bentinck Street, had already, as we have seen, joined
the gallery as a reporter for one of the morning papers,
and was now in the more comfortable circumstances
derived from the addition to his official pension which
this praiseworthy labor insured; but his own engagement
on the <i>Chronicle</i> dates somewhat later. His
first parliamentary service was given to the <i>True Sun</i>,
a journal which had then on its editorial staff some dear
friends of mine, through whom I became myself a contributor
to it, and afterwards, in common with all concerned,
whether in its writing, reporting, printing, or
publishing, a sharer in its difficulties. The most formidable
of these arrived one day in a general strike of
the reporters; and I well remember noticing at this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
dread time, on the staircase of the magnificent mansion
we were lodged in, a young man of my own age, whose
keen animation of look would have arrested attention
anywhere, and whose name, upon inquiry, I then for
the first time heard. It was coupled with the fact,
which gave it interest even then, that "young Dickens"
had been spokesman for the recalcitrant reporters, and
conducted their case triumphantly. He was afterwards
during two sessions engaged for the <i>Mirror of Parliament</i>,
which one of his uncles by the mother's side
originated and conducted; and finally, in his twenty-third
year, he became a reporter for the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>A step far more momentous to him (though then he
did not know it) he had taken shortly before. In the
December number for 1833 of what then was called the
<i>Old Monthly Magazine</i>, his first published piece of
writing had seen the light. He has described himself
dropping this paper (Mr. Minns and his Cousin, as he
afterwards entitled it, but which appeared in the magazine
as A Dinner at Poplar Walk) stealthily one evening
at twilight, with fear and trembling, into a dark
letter-box in a dark office up a dark court in Fleet
Street; and he has told his agitation when it appeared
in all the glory of print: "On which occasion I
walked down to Westminster Hall, and turned into it
for half an hour, because my eyes were so dimmed
with joy and pride that they could not bear the street,
and were not fit to be seen there." He had purchased
the magazine at a shop in the Strand; and exactly two
years afterwards, in the younger member of a publishing
firm who had called, at the chambers in Furnival's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Inn to which he had moved soon after entering the
gallery, with the proposal that originated <i>Pickwick</i>, he
recognized the person he had bought that magazine
from, and whom before or since he had never seen.</p>

<p>This interval of two years more than comprised
what remained of his career in the gallery and the engagements
connected with it; but that this occupation
was of the utmost importance in its influence on his life,
in the discipline of his powers as well as of his character,
there can be no doubt whatever. "To the wholesome
training of severe newspaper work, when I was a very
young man, I constantly refer my first successes," he
said to the New York editors when he last took leave
of them. It opened to him a wide and varied range
of experience, which his wonderful observation, exact as
it was humorous, made entirely his own. He saw the
last of the old coaching-days, and of the old inns that
were a part of them; but it will be long before the
readers of his living page see the last of the life of either.
"There never was," he once wrote to me (in 1845),
"anybody connected with newspapers who, in the same
space of time, had so much express and post-chaise experience
as I. And what gentlemen they were to serve,
in such things, at the old <i>Morning Chronicle!</i> Great
or small it did not matter. I have had to charge for
half a dozen break-downs in half a dozen times as many
miles. I have had to charge for the damage of a great-coat
from the drippings of a blazing wax candle, in writing
through the smallest hours of the night in a swift-flying
carriage-and-pair. I have had to charge for all
sorts of breakages fifty times in a journey without question,
such being the ordinary results of the pace which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
we went at. I have charged for broken hats, broken
luggage, broken chaises, broken harness&mdash;everything
but a broken head, which is the only thing they would
have grumbled to pay for."</p>

<p>Something to the same effect he said publicly twenty
years later, on the occasion of his presiding, in May,
1865, at the second annual dinner of the Newspaper
Press Fund, when he condensed within the compass of
his speech a summary of the whole of his reporting life.
"I am not here," he said, "advocating the case of a
mere ordinary client of whom I have little or no knowledge.
I hold a brief to-night for my brothers. I went
into the gallery of the House of Commons as a parliamentary
reporter when I was a boy, and I left it&mdash;I can
hardly believe the inexorable truth&mdash;nigh thirty years
ago. I have pursued the calling of a reporter under
circumstances of which many of my brethren here can
form no adequate conception. I have often transcribed
for the printer, from my short-hand notes, important
public speeches in which the strictest accuracy was required,
and a mistake in which would have been to a
young man severely compromising, writing on the palm
of my hand, by the light of a dark-lantern, in a post-chaise
and four, galloping through a wild country, and
through the dead of the night, at the then surprising
rate of fifteen miles an hour. The very last time I was
at Exeter, I strolled into the castle-yard there, to identify,
for the amusement of a friend, the spot on which
I once 'took,' as we used to call it, an election-speech
of Lord John Russell at the Devon contest, in the midst
of a lively fight maintained by all the vagabonds in that
division of the county, and under such a pelting rain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
that I remember two good-natured colleagues, who
chanced to be at leisure, held a pocket-handkerchief
over my note-book, after the manner of a state canopy
in an ecclesiastical procession. I have worn my knees
by writing on them on the old back row of the old
gallery of the old House of Commons; and I have worn
my feet by standing to write in a preposterous pen in
the old House of Lords, where we used to be huddled
together like so many sheep,&mdash;kept in waiting, say,
until the woolsack might want restuffing. Returning
home from exciting political meetings in the country to
the waiting press in London, I do verily believe I have
been upset in almost every description of vehicle known
in this country. I have been, in my time, belated on
miry by-roads, towards the small hours, forty or fifty
miles from London, in a wheelless carriage, with exhausted
horses and drunken post-boys, and have got
back in time for publication, to be received with never-forgotten
compliments by the late Mr. Black, coming
in the broadest of Scotch from the broadest of hearts I
ever knew. These trivial things I mention as an assurance
to you that I never have forgotten the fascination
of that old pursuit. The pleasure that I used to feel in
the rapidity and dexterity of its exercise has never faded
out of my breast. Whatever little cunning of hand or
head I took to it, or acquired in it, I have so retained
as that I fully believe I could resume it to-morrow, very
little the worse from long disuse. To this present year
of my life, when I sit in this hall, or where not, hearing
a dull speech (the phenomenon does occur), I sometimes
beguile the tedium of the moment by mentally
following the speaker in the old, old way; and sometimes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
if you can believe me, I even find my hand going
on the table-cloth, taking an imaginary note of it all."
The latter I have known him do frequently. It was
indeed a quite ordinary habit with him.</p>

<p>Mr. James Grant, a writer who was himself in the
gallery with Dickens, and who states that among its
eighty or ninety reporters he occupied the very highest
rank, not merely for accuracy in reporting but for marvelous
quickness in transcribing, has lately also told
us that while there he was exceedingly reserved in his
manners, and that, though showing the usual courtesies
to all he was concerned with in his duties, the only personal
intimacy he formed was with Mr. Thomas Beard,
then too reporting for the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>. I have
already mentioned the friendly and familiar relations
maintained with this gentleman to the close of his life;
and in confirmation of Mr. Grant's statement I can
further say that the only other associate of these early
reporting days to whom I ever heard him refer with
special regard was the late Mr. Vincent Dowling, many
years editor of <i>Bell's Life</i>, with whom he did not continue
much personal intercourse, but of whose character
as well as talents he had formed a very high
opinion. Nor is there anything to add to the notice
of these days which the reader's fancy may not easily
supply. A letter has been kept as written by him while
engaged on one of his "expresses;" but it is less for
its saying anything new, than for its confirming with a
pleasant vividness what has been said already, that its
contents will justify mention here.</p>

<p>He writes, on a "Tuesday morning" in May, 1835,
from the Bush Inn, Bristol; the occasion that has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
taken him to the west, connected with a reporting party,
being Lord John Russell's Devonshire contest above
named, and his associate-chief being Mr. Beard, intrusted
with command for the <i>Chronicle</i> in this particular
express. He expects to forward "the conclusion of
Russell's dinner" by Cooper's company's coach leaving
the Bush at half-past six next morning; and by the
first Ball's coach on Thursday morning he will forward
the report of the Bath dinner, indorsing the parcel for
immediate delivery, with extra rewards for the porter.
Beard is to go over to Bath next morning. He is himself
to come back by the mail from Marlborough; he
has no doubt, if Lord John makes a speech of any ordinary
dimensions, it can be done by the time Marlborough
is reached; "and taking into consideration
the immense importance of having the addition of
saddle-horses from thence, it is, beyond all doubt,
worth an effort.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I need not say," he continues,
"that it will be sharp work and will require two of us;
for we shall both be up the whole of the previous night,
and shall have to sit up all night again to get it off in
time." He adds that as soon as they have had a little
sleep they will return to town as quickly as they can;
but they have, if the express succeeds, to stop at sundry
places along the road to pay money and notify satisfaction.
And so, for himself and Beard, he is his
editor's very sincerely.</p>

<p>Another anecdote of these reporting days, with its
sequel, may be added from his own alleged relation, in
which, however, mistakes occur that it seems strange
he should have made. The story, as told, is that the
late Lord Derby, when Mr. Stanley, had on some important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
occasion made a speech which all the reporters
found it necessary greatly to abridge; that its essential
points had nevertheless been so well given in the
<i>Chronicle</i> that Mr. Stanley, having need of it for himself
in greater detail, had sent a request to the reporter
to meet him in Carlton House Terrace and take down
the entire speech; that Dickens attended and did the
work accordingly, much to Mr. Stanley's satisfaction;
and that, on his dining with Mr. Gladstone in recent
years, and finding the aspect of the dining-room
strangely familiar, he discovered afterwards on inquiry
that it was there he had taken the speech. The story,
as it actually occurred, is connected with the brief life
of the <i>Mirror of Parliament</i>. It was not at any special
desire of Mr. Stanley's, but for that new record of the
debates, which had been started by one of the uncles
of Dickens and professed to excel <i>Hansard</i> in giving
verbatim reports, that the famous speech against
O'Connell was taken as described. The young reporter
went to the room in Carlton Terrace because
the work of his uncle Barrow's publication required to
be done there; and if, in later years, the great author
was in the same room as the guest of the prime minister,
it must have been but a month or two before he
died, when for the first time he visited and breakfasted
with Mr. Gladstone.</p>

<p>The mention of his career in the gallery may close
with the incident. I will only add that his observation
while there had not led him to form any high
opinion of the House of Commons or its heroes, and
that of the Pickwickian sense which so often takes the
place of common sense in our legislature he omitted no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
opportunity of declaring his contempt at every part of
his life.</p>

<p>The other occupation had meanwhile not been lost
sight of, and for this we are to go back a little. Since
the first sketch appeared in the <i>Monthly Magazine</i>, nine
others have enlivened the pages of later numbers of the
same magazine, the last in February, 1835, and that
which appeared in the preceding August having first
had the signature of Boz. This was the nickname of
a pet child, his youngest brother Augustus, whom in
honor of the <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i> he had dubbed Moses,
which being facetiously pronounced through the nose
became Boses, and being shortened became Boz. "Boz
was a very familiar household word to me, long before
I was an author, and so I came to adopt it." Thus had
he fully invented his Sketches by Boz before they were
even so called, or any one was ready to give much attention
to them; and the next invention needful to
himself was some kind of payment in return for them.
The magazine was owned as well as conducted at this
time by a Mr. Holland, who had come back from Bolivar's
South American campaigns with the rank of captain,
and had hoped to make it a popular mouthpiece
for his ardent liberalism. But this hope, as well as his
own health, quite failed; and he had sorrowfully to decline
receiving any more of the sketches when they had
to cease as voluntary offerings. I do not think that
either he or the magazine lived many weeks after an
evening I passed with him in Doughty Street in 1837,
when he spoke in a very touching way of the failure
of this and other enterprises of his life, and of the help
that Dickens had been to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing thus being forthcoming from the <i>Monthly</i>, it
was of course but natural the sketches too should cease
to be forthcoming; and, even before the above-named
February number appeared, a new opening had been
found for them. An evening offshoot to the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i> had been lately in hand; and to a countryman
of Black's engaged in the preparations for it, Mr.
George Hogarth, Dickens was communicating from his
rooms in Furnival's Inn, on the evening of Tuesday,
the 20th of January, 1835, certain hopes and fancies he
had formed. This was the beginning of his knowledge
of an accomplished and kindly man, with whose family
his relations were soon to become so intimate as to have
an influence on all his future career. Mr. Hogarth had
asked him, as a favor to himself, to write an original
sketch for the first number of the enterprise, and in
writing back to say with what readiness he should comply,
and how anxiously he should desire to do his best
for the person who had made the request, he mentioned
what had arisen in his mind. It had occurred to him
that he might not be unreasonably or improperly trespassing
farther on Mr. Hogarth if, trusting to his kindness
to refer the application to the proper quarter, he
begged to ask whether it was probable, if he commenced
a regular series of articles under some attractive
title for the <i>Evening Chronicle</i>, its conductors would
think he had any claim to <i>some</i> additional remuneration
(of course, of no great amount) for doing so. In short,
he wished to put it to the proprietors&mdash;first, whether
a continuation of some chapters of light papers in the
style of his street-sketches would be considered of use
to the new journal; and secondly, if so, whether they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
would not think it fair and reasonable that, taking his
share of the ordinary reporting business of the <i>Chronicle</i>
besides, he should receive something for the papers
beyond his ordinary salary as a reporter. The request
was thought fair, he began the sketches, and his salary
was raised from five to seven guineas a week.</p>

<p>They went on, with undiminished spirit and freshness,
throughout the year; and, much as they were
talked of outside as well as in the world of newspapers,
nothing in connection with them delighted the writer
half so much as the hearty praise of his own editor.
Mr. Black is one of the men who has passed without
recognition out of a world his labors largely benefited,
but with those who knew him no man was so popular,
as well for his broad kindly humor as for his honest
great-hearted enjoyment of whatever was excellent in
others. Dickens to the last remembered that it was
most of all the cordial help of this good old mirth-loving
man which had started him joyfully on his career
of letters. "It was John Black that flung the slipper
after me," he would often say. "Dear old Black! my
first hearty out-and-out appreciator," is an expression
in one of his letters written to me in the year he died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> opening of 1836 found him collecting into two
volumes the first series of <i>Sketches by Boz</i>, of which he
had sold the copyright for a conditional payment of (I
think) a hundred and fifty pounds to a young publisher
named Macrone, whose acquaintance he had made
through Mr. Ainsworth a few weeks before.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> At this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
time also, we are told in a letter before quoted, the
editorship of the <i>Monthly Magazine</i> having come into
Mr. James Grant's hands, this gentleman, applying to
him through its previous editor to know if he would
again contribute to it, learned two things: the first,
that he was going to be married; and the second, that,
having entered into an arrangement to write a monthly
serial, his duties in future would leave him small spare
time. Both pieces of news were soon confirmed. The
<i>Times</i> of the 26th of March, 1836, gave notice that on
the 31st would be published the first shilling number
of the <i>Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club, edited
by Boz;</i> and the same journal of a few days later announced
that on the 2d of April Mr. Charles Dickens
had married Catherine, the eldest daughter of Mr.
George Hogarth, whom already we have met as his
fellow-worker on the <i>Chronicle</i>. The honeymoon was
passed in the neighborhood to which at all times of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
interest in his life he turned with a strange recurring
fondness; and while the young couple are at the quiet
little village of Chalk, on the road between Gravesend
and Rochester, I will relate exactly the origin of the
ever-memorable Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>A young publishing-house had started recently,
among other enterprises ingenious rather than important,
a Library of Fiction; among the authors they
wished to enlist in it was the writer of the sketches in
the <i>Monthly;</i> and, to the extent of one paper during the
past year, they had effected this through their editor,
Mr. Charles Whitehead, a very ingenious and very
unfortunate man. "I was not aware," wrote the elder
member of the firm to Dickens, thirteen years later, in
a letter to which reference was made<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in the preface to
<i>Pickwick</i> in one of his later editions, "that you were
writing in the <i>Chronicle</i>, or what your name was; but
Whitehead, who was an old <i>Monthly</i> man, recollected
it, and got you to write The Tuggs's at Ramsgate."</p>

<p>And now comes another person on the scene. "In
November, 1835," continues Mr. Chapman, "we published
a little book called the <i>Squib Annual</i>, with plates
by Seymour; and it was during my visit to him to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
after them that he said he should like to do a series of
cockney-sporting plates of a superior sort to those he
had already published. I said I thought they might
do, if accompanied by letter-press and published in
monthly parts; and, this being agreed to, we wrote to
the author of <i>Three Courses and a Dessert</i>, and proposed
it; but, receiving no answer, the scheme dropped
for some months, till Seymour said he wished us to
decide, as another job had offered which would fully
occupy his time; and it was on this we decided to ask
you to do it. Having opened already a connection
with you for our Library of Fiction, we naturally applied
to you to do the <i>Pickwick;</i> but I do not think
we even mentioned our intention to Mr. Seymour, and
I am quite sure that from the beginning to the end
nobody but yourself had anything whatever to do with
it. Our prospectus was out at the end of February,
and it had all been arranged before that date."</p>

<p>The member of the firm who carried the application
to him in Furnival's Inn was not the writer of this letter,
but Mr. Hall, who had sold him two years before,
not knowing that he was the purchaser, the magazine
in which his first effusion was printed; and he has himself
described what passed at the interview: "The
idea propounded to me was that the monthly something
should be a vehicle for certain plates to be executed by
Mr. Seymour; and there was a notion, either on the
part of that admirable humorous artist, or of my visitor,
that a <span class="smcap">Nimrod Club</span>, the members of which were
to go out shooting, fishing, and so forth, and getting
themselves into difficulties through their want of dexterity,
would be the best means of introducing these.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
I objected, on consideration that, although born and
partly bred in the country, I was no great sportsman,
except in regard to all kinds of locomotion; that the
idea was not novel, and had already been much used;
that it would be infinitely better for the plates to arise
naturally out of the text; and that I would like to take
my own way, with a freer range of English scenes and
people, and was afraid I should ultimately do so in any
case, whatever course I might prescribe to myself at
starting. My views being deferred to, I thought of
Mr. Pickwick, and wrote the first number; from the
proof-sheets of which Mr. Seymour made his drawing
of the club and his happy portrait of its founder. I
connected Mr. Pickwick with a club, because of the
original suggestion; and I put in Mr. Winkle expressly
for the use of Mr. Seymour."</p>

<p>Mr. Hall was dead when this statement was first
made, in the preface to the cheap edition in 1847; but
Mr. Chapman clearly recollected his partner's account
of the interview, and confirmed every part of it, in his
letter of 1849,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> with one exception. In giving Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Seymour credit for the figure by which all the habitable
globe knows Mr. Pickwick, and which certainly at the
outset helped to make him a reality, it had given the
artist too much. The reader will hardly be so startled
as I was on coming to the closing line of Mr. Chapman's
confirmatory letter: "As this letter is to be historical,
I may as well claim what little belongs to me in
the matter, and that is the figure of Pickwick. Seymour's
first sketch was of a long, thin man. The present
immortal one he made from my description of a
friend of mine at Richmond, a fat old beau, who would
wear, in spite of the ladies' protests, drab tights and
black gaiters. His name was John Foster."</p>

<p>On the coincidences, resemblances, and surprises of
life, Dickens liked especially to dwell, and few things
moved his fancy so pleasantly. The world, he would
say, was so much smaller than we thought it; we were
all so connected by fate without knowing it; people
supposed to be far apart were so constantly elbowing
each other; and to-morrow bore so close a resemblance
to nothing half so much as to yesterday. Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
were the only two leading incidents of his own life
before I knew him, his marriage and the first appearance
of his Pickwick; and it turned out after all that
I had some shadowy association with both. He was
married on the anniversary of my birthday, and the
original of the figure of Mr. Pickwick bore my name.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The first number had not yet appeared when his
<i>Sketches by Boz, Illustrative of Every-Day Life and
Every-Day People</i>, came forth in two duodecimos with
some capital cuts by Cruikshank, and with a preface in
which he spoke of the nervousness he should have had
in venturing alone before the public, and of his delight
in getting the help of Cruikshank, who had frequently
contributed to the success, though his well-earned
reputation rendered it impossible for him ever to have
shared the hazard, of similar undertakings. It very
soon became apparent that there was no hazard here.
The <i>Sketches</i> were much more talked about than the
first two or three numbers of <i>Pickwick</i>, and I remember
still with what hearty praise the book was first
named to me by my dear friend Albany Fonblanque,
as keen and clear a judge as ever lived either of books
or men. Richly did it merit all the praise it had, and
more, I will add, than he was ever disposed to give to
it himself. He decidedly underrated it. He gave, in
subsequent writings, so much more perfect form and
fullness to everything it contained, that he did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
care to credit himself with the marvel of having yet so
early anticipated so much. But the first sprightly runnings
of his genius are undoubtedly here. Mr. Bumble
is in the parish sketches, and Mr. Dawkins the dodger
in the Old Bailey scenes. There is laughter and fun to
excess, never misapplied; there are the minute points
and shades of character, with all the discrimination
and nicety of detail, afterwards so famous; there is
everywhere the most perfect ease and skill of handling.
The observation shown throughout is nothing short of
wonderful. Things are painted literally as they are,
and, whatever the picture, whether of every-day vulgar,
shabby-genteel, or downright low, with neither the
condescending air which is affectation, nor the too
familiar one which is slang. The book altogether is a
perfectly unaffected, unpretentious, honest performance.
Under its manly, sensible, straightforward vein of talk
there is running at the same time a natural flow of sentiment
never sentimental, of humor always easy and
unforced, and of pathos for the most part dramatic or
picturesque, under which lay the germ of what his
mature genius took afterwards most delight in. Of
course there are inequalities in it, and some things that
would have been better away; but it is a book that
might have stood its ground, even if it had stood alone,
as containing unusually truthful observation of a sort
of life between the middle class and the low, which,
having few attractions for bookish observers, was quite
unhackneyed ground. It had otherwise also the very
special merit of being in no respect bookish or commonplace
in its descriptions of the old city with which
its writer was so familiar. It was a picture of every-day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
London at its best and worst, in its humors and
enjoyments as well as its sufferings and sins, pervaded
everywhere not only with the absolute reality of the
things depicted, but also with that subtle sense and
mastery of feeling which gives to the reader's sympathies
invariably right direction, and awakens consideration,
tenderness, and kindness precisely for those who most
need such help.</p>

<p>Between the first and the second numbers of <i>Pickwick</i>,
the artist, Mr. Seymour, died by his own hand;
and the number came out with three instead of four
illustrations. Dickens had seen the unhappy man only
once, forty-eight hours before his death; when he went
to Furnival's Inn with an etching for the "stroller's
tale" in that number, which, altered at Dickens's suggestion,
he brought away again for the few further
touches that occupied him to a late hour of the night
before he destroyed himself. A notice attached to the
number informed the public of this latter fact. There
was at first a little difficulty in replacing him, and for
a single number Mr. Buss was interposed. But before
the fourth number a choice had been made, which as
time went on was so thoroughly justified, that through
the greater part of the wonderful career which was
then beginning the connection was kept up, and Mr.
Hablot Browne's name is not unworthily associated
with the masterpieces of Dickens's genius. An incident
which I heard related by Mr. Thackeray at one
of the Royal Academy dinners belongs to this time:
"I can remember when Mr. Dickens was a very young
man, and had commenced delighting the world with
some charming humorous works in covers which were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
colored light green and came out once a month, that
this young man wanted an artist to illustrate his writings;
and I recollect walking up to his chambers in
Furnival's Inn, with two or three drawings in my hand,
which, strange to say, he did not find suitable." Dickens
has himself described another change now made in
the publication: "We started with a number of twenty-four
pages and four illustrations. Mr. Seymour's sudden
and lamented death before the second number
was published, brought about a quick decision upon a
point already in agitation: the number became one of
thirty-two pages with only two illustrations, and remained
so to the end."</p>

<p>The Session of 1836 terminated his connection with
the gallery, and some fruits of his increased leisure
showed themselves before the close of the year. His
eldest sister's musical attainments and connections had
introduced him to many cultivators and professors of
that art; he was led to take much interest in Mr. Braham's
enterprise at the St. James's theatre; and in aid
of it he wrote a farce for Mr. Harley, founded upon
one of his sketches, and the story and songs for an
opera composed by his friend Mr. Hullah. Both the
<i>Strange Gentleman</i>, acted in September, and the <i>Village
Coquettes</i>, produced in December, 1836, had a good
success; and the last is memorable to me for having
brought me first into personal communication with
Dickens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first letter I had from him was at the close of
1836, from Furnival's Inn, when he sent me the book
of his opera of the <i>Village Coquettes</i>, which had been
published by Mr. Bentley; and this was followed, two
months later, by his collected <i>Sketches</i>, both first and
second series; which he desired me to receive "as a
very small testimony of the donor's regard and obligations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
as well as of his desire to cultivate and avail himself
of a friendship which has been so pleasantly thrown
in his way.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In short, if you will receive them for
my sake and not for their own, you will very greatly
oblige me." I had met him in the interval at the house
of our common friend Mr. Ainsworth, and I remember
vividly the impression then made upon me.</p>

<p>Very different was his face in those days from that
which photography has made familiar to the present
generation. A look of youthfulness first attracted you,
and then a candor and openness of expression which
made you sure of the qualities within. The features
were very good. He had a capital forehead, a firm
nose with full wide nostril, eyes wonderfully beaming
with intellect and running over with humor and cheerfulness,
and a rather prominent mouth strongly marked
with sensibility. The head was altogether well formed
and symmetrical, and the air and carriage of it were
extremely spirited. The hair so scant and grizzled in
later days was then of a rich brown and most luxuriant
abundance, and the bearded face of his last two decades
had hardly a vestige of hair or whisker; but there was
that in the face as I first recollect it which no time could
change, and which remained implanted on it unalterably
to the last. This was the quickness, keenness, and
practical power, the eager, restless, energetic outlook
on each several feature, that seemed to tell so little of a
student or writer of books, and so much of a man of
action and business in the world. Light and motion
flashed from every part of it. <i>It was as if made of
steel</i>, was said of it, four or five years after the time to
which I am referring, by a most original and delicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
observer, the late Mrs. Carlyle. "What a face is his
to meet in a drawing-room!" wrote Leigh Hunt to me,
the morning after I made them known to each other.
"It has the life and soul in it of fifty human beings."
In such sayings are expressed not alone the restless and
resistless vivacity and force of which I have spoken, but
that also which lay beneath them of steadiness and hard
endurance.</p>

<p>Several unsuccessful efforts were made by each to get
the other to his house before the door of either was
opened at last. A son had been born to him on Twelfth-day
(the 6th January, 1837), and before the close of the
following month he and his wife were in the lodgings
at Chalk they had occupied after their marriage. Early
in March there is a letter from him accounting for the
failure of a promise to call on me because of "a crew
of house-agents and attorneys" through whom he had
nearly missed his conveyance to Chalk, and been made
"more than half wild besides." This was his last
letter from Furnival's Inn. In that same month he
went to 48, Doughty Street; and in his first letter to
me from that address, dated at the close of the month,
there is this passage: "We only called upon you a second
time in the hope of getting you to dine with us, and
were much disappointed not to find you. I have delayed
writing a reply to your note, meaning to call
upon you. I have been so much engaged, however, in
the pleasant occupation of 'moving' that I have not
had time; and I am obliged at last to write and say
that I have been long engaged to the <i>Pickwick</i> publishers
to a dinner in honor of that hero which comes
off to-morrow. I am consequently unable to accept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
your kind invite, which I frankly own I should have
liked much better."</p>

<p>That Saturday's celebration of his twelfth number,
the anniversary of the birth of <i>Pickwick</i>, preceded by
but a few weeks a personal sorrow which profoundly
moved him. His wife's next younger sister, Mary,
who lived with them, and by sweetness of nature even
more than by graces of person had made herself the
ideal of his life, died with a terrible suddenness that
for the time completely bore him down.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> His grief
and suffering were intense, and affected him, as will be
seen, through many after-years. The publication of
<i>Pickwick</i> was interrupted for two months, the effort of
writing it not being possible to him. He moved for
change of scene to Hampstead, and here, at the close
of May, I visited him, and became first his guest. More
than ordinarily susceptible at the moment to all kindliest
impressions, his heart opened itself to mine. I
left him as much his friend, and as entirely in his confidence,
as if I had known him for years. Nor had
many weeks passed before he addressed to me from
Doughty Street words which it is my sorrowful pride to
remember have had literal fulfillment: "I look back
with unmingled pleasure to every link which each ensuing
week has added to the chain of our attachment.
It shall go hard, I hope, ere anything but Death impairs
the toughness of a bond now so firmly riveted." It
remained unweakened till death came.</p>

<p>There were circumstances that drew us at once into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
frequent and close communication. What the sudden
popularity of his writings implied, was known to others
some time before it was known to himself; and he was
only now becoming gradually conscious of all the disadvantage
this had placed him at. He would have
laughed if, at this outset of his wonderful fortune in
literature, his genius acknowledged by all without misgiving,
young, popular, and prosperous, any one had
compared him to the luckless men of letters of former
days, whose common fate was to be sold into a slavery
which their later lives were passed in vain endeavors to
escape from. Not so was his fate to be, yet something
of it he was doomed to experience. He had unwittingly
sold himself into a quasi-bondage, and had to
purchase his liberty at a heavy cost, after considerable
suffering.</p>

<p>It was not until the fourth or fifth number of <i>Pickwick</i>
(in the latter Sam Weller made his first appearance)
that its importance began to be understood by
"the trade," and on the eve of the issue of its sixth
number, the 22d August, 1836, he had signed an agreement
with Mr. Bentley to undertake the editorship of a
monthly magazine to be started the following January,
to which he was to supply a serial story; and soon afterwards
he had agreed with the same publisher to write
two other tales, the first at a specified early date; the
expressed remuneration in each case being certainly
quite inadequate to the claims of a writer of any marked
popularity. Under these Bentley agreements he was
now writing, month by month, the first half of <i>Oliver
Twist</i>, and, under his Chapman &amp; Hall agreement,
the last half of <i>Pickwick</i>, not even by a week in advance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of the printer with either; when a circumstance
became known to him of which he thus wrote to me:</p>

<p>"I heard half an hour ago, on authority which leaves
me in no doubt about the matter (from the binder of
<i>Pickwick</i>, in fact), that Macrone intends publishing a
new issue of my <i>Sketches</i> in monthly parts of nearly the
same size and in just the same form as the <i>Pickwick
Papers</i>. I need not tell you that this is calculated to
injure me most seriously, or that I have a very natural
and most decided objection to being supposed to presume
upon the success of the <i>Pickwick</i>, and thus foist
this old work upon the public in its new dress for the
mere purpose of putting money in my own pocket.
Neither need I say that the fact of my name being
before the town, attached to three publications at the
same time, must prove seriously prejudicial to my reputation.
As you are acquainted with the circumstances
under which these copyrights were disposed of, and as
I know I may rely on your kind help, may I beg you to
see Macrone, and to state in the strongest and most emphatic
manner my feeling on this point? I wish him
to be reminded of the sums he paid for those books;
of the sale he has had for them; of the extent to which
he has already pushed them; and of the very great
profits he must necessarily have acquired from them. I
wish him also to be reminded that no intention of publishing
them in this form was in the remotest manner
hinted to me, by him or on his behalf, when he obtained
possession of the copyright. I then wish you to
put it to his feelings of common honesty and fair dealing
whether after this communication he will persevere
in his intention." What else the letter contained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
need not be quoted, but it strongly moved me to do
my best.</p>

<p>I found Mr. Macrone inaccessible to all arguments
of persuasion, however. That he had bought the book
for a small sum at a time when the smallest was not unimportant
to the writer, shortly before his marriage,
and that he had since made very considerable profits
by it, in no way disturbed his position that he had a
right to make as much as he could of what was his,
without regard to how it had become so. There was
nothing for it but to change front, and, admitting it
might be a less evil to the unlucky author to repurchase
than to let the monthly issue proceed, to ask
what further gain was looked for; but so wide a mouth
was opened at this that I would have no part in the
costly process of filling it. I told Dickens so, and
strongly counseled him to keep quiet for a time.</p>

<p>But the worry and vexation were too great with all
the work he had in hand, and I was hardly surprised
next day to receive the letter sent me; which yet
should be prefaced with the remark that suspense of any
kind was at all times intolerable to the writer. The
interval between the accomplishment of anything, and
"its first motion," Dickens never could endure, and
he was too ready to make any sacrifice to abridge or
end it. This did not belong to the strong side of his
character, and advantage was frequently taken of the
fact. "I sent down just now to know whether you
were at home (two o'clock), as Chapman &amp; Hall were
with me, and, the case being urgent, I wished to have
the further benefit of your kind advice and assistance.
Macrone and H&mdash;&mdash; (arcades ambo) waited on them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
this morning, and after a long discussion peremptorily
refused to take one farthing less than the two thousand
pounds. H&mdash;&mdash; repeated the statement of figures which
he made to you yesterday, and put it to Hall whether
he could say from his knowledge of such matters that
the estimate of probable profit was exorbitant. Hall,
whose judgment may be relied on in such matters, could
not dispute the justice of the calculation. And so the
matter stood. In this dilemma it occurred to them
(my <i>Pickwick</i> men), whether, if the <i>Sketches must</i> appear
in monthly numbers, it would not be better for
them to appear for their benefit and mine conjointly
than for Macrone's sole use and behoof; whether they,
having all the <i>Pickwick</i> machinery in full operation,
could not obtain for them a much larger sale than
Macrone could ever get; and whether, even at this
large price of two thousand pounds, we might not,
besides retaining the copyright, reasonably hope for a
good profit on the outlay. These suggestions having
presented themselves, they came straight to me (having
obtained a few hours' respite) and proposed that we
should purchase the copyrights between us for the two
thousand pounds, and publish them in monthly parts.
I need not say that no other form of publication would
repay the expenditure; and they wish me to explain by
an address that <i>they</i>, who may be fairly put forward as
the parties, have been driven into that mode of publication,
or the copyrights would have been lost. I
considered the matter in every possible way. I sent
for you, but you were out. I thought of"&mdash;what need
not be repeated, now that all is past and gone&mdash;"and
consented. Was I right? I think you will say yes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
I could not say no, though I was glad to have been no
party to a price so exorbitant; which yet profited extremely
little the person who received it. He died in
hardly more than two years; and if Dickens had enjoyed
the most liberal treatment at his hands, he could
not have exerted himself more generously for the widow
and children.</p>

<p>His new story was now beginning largely to share
attention with his <i>Pickwick Papers</i>, and it was delightful
to see how real all its people became to him. What
I had most, indeed, to notice in him, at the very outset
of his career, was his indifference to any praise of
his performances on the merely literary side, compared
with the higher recognition of them as bits of actual
life, with the meaning and purpose on their part, and
the responsibility on his, of realities rather than creatures
of fancy. The exception that might be drawn
from <i>Pickwick</i> is rather in seeming than substance. A
first book has its immunities, and the distinction of
this from the rest of the writings appears in what has
been said of its origin. The plan of it was simply to
amuse. It was to string together whimsical sketches
of the pencil by entertaining sketches of the pen; and,
at its beginning, where or how it was to end was as
little known to himself as to any of its readers. But
genius is a master as well as a servant, and when the
laughter and fun were at their highest something graver
made its appearance. He had to defend himself for
this; and he said that, though the mere oddity of a
new acquaintance was apt to impress one at first, the
more serious qualities were discovered when we became
friends with the man. In other words he might have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
said that the change was become necessary for his own
satisfaction. The book itself, in teaching him what his
power was, had made him more conscious of what
would be expected from its use; and this never afterwards
quitted him. In what he was to do hereafter,
as in all he was doing now, with <i>Pickwick</i> still to finish
and <i>Oliver</i> only beginning, it constantly attended him.
Nor could it well be otherwise, with all those fanciful
creations so real, to a nature in itself so practical and
earnest; and in this spirit I had well understood the
letter accompanying what had been published of <i>Oliver</i>
since its commencement the preceding February, which
reached me the day after I visited him. Something to
the effect of what has just been said, I had remarked
publicly of the portion of the story sent to me; and
his instant warm-hearted acknowledgment, of which I
permit myself to quote a line or two, showed me in
what perfect agreement we were: "How can I thank
you? Can I do better than by saying that the sense
of poor Oliver's reality, which I know you have had
from the first, has been the highest of all praise to me?
None that has been lavished upon me have I felt half
so much as that appreciation of my intent and meaning.
You know I have ever done so, for it was your
feeling for me and mine for you that first brought us
together, and I hope will keep us so till death do us
part. Your notices make me grateful, but very proud:
so have a care of them."</p>

<p>There was nothing written by him after this date
which I did not see before the world did, either in
manuscript or proofs; and in connection with the
latter I shortly began to give him the help which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
publicly mentioned twenty years later in dedicating
his collected writings to me. One of his letters reminds
me when these corrections began, and they
were continued very nearly to the last. They lightened
for him a labor of which he had more than
enough imposed upon him at this time by others, and
they were never anything but an enjoyment to me.
"I have," he wrote, "so many sheets of the <i>Miscellany</i>
to correct before I can begin <i>Oliver</i>, that I fear I shall
not be able to leave home this morning. I therefore
send your revise of the <i>Pickwick</i> by Fred, who is on
his way with it to the printers. You will see that
my alterations are very slight, but I think for the
better." This was the fourteenth number of the <i>Pickwick
Papers</i>. Fred was his next younger brother, who
lived with him at the time.</p>

<p>The number following this was the famous one in
which the hero finds himself in the Fleet; and another
of his letters will show what enjoyment the writing of
it had given to himself. I had sent to ask him where
we were to meet for a proposed ride that day. "<span class="smcap">Here</span>,"
was his reply. "I am slippered and jacketed, and,
like that same starling who is so very seldom quoted,
can't get out. I am getting on, thank Heaven, like
'a house o' fire,' and think the next <i>Pickwick</i> will bang
all the others. I shall expect you at one, and we will
walk to the stable together. If you know anybody at
Saint Paul's, I wish you'd send round and ask them
not to ring the bell so. I can hardly hear my own
ideas as they come into my head, and say what they
mean."</p>

<p>The exulting tone of confidence in what he had thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
been writing was indeed well justified. He had as yet
done nothing so remarkable, in blending humor with
tragedy, as his picture of what the poor side of a debtors'
prison was in the days of which we have seen that he
had himself had bitter experience; and we have but to
recall, as it rises sharply to the memory, what is contained
in this portion of a work that was not only
among his earliest but his least considered as to plan,
to understand what it was that not alone had given
him his fame so early, but that in itself held the germ
of the future that awaited him. Every point was a
telling one, and the truthfulness of the whole unerring.
The dreadful restlessness of the place, undefined yet
unceasing, unsatisfying and terrible, was pictured
throughout with De Foe's minute reality; while points
of character were handled in that greater style which
connects with the richest oddities of humor an insight
into principles of character universal as nature itself.
When he resolved that Sam Weller should be occupant
of the prison with Mr. Pickwick, he was perhaps thinking
of his favorite Smollett, and how, when Peregrine
Pickle was inmate of the Fleet, Hatchway and Pipes
refused to leave him; but Fielding himself might have
envied his way of setting about it. Nor is any portion
of his picture less admirable than this. The comedy
gradually deepening into tragedy; the shabby vagabonds
who are the growth of debtors' prisons, contrasting
with the poor simple creatures who are their
sacrifices and victims; Mr. Mivins and Mr. Smangle
side by side with the cobbler ruined by his legacy, who
sleeps under the table to remind himself of his old
four-poster; Mr. Pickwick's first night in the marshal's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
room, Sam Weller entertaining Stiggins in the snuggery,
Jingle in decline, and the chancery prisoner
dying; in all these scenes there was writing of the first
order, a deep feeling of character, that delicate form
of humor which has a quaintly pathetic turn in it as
well, comedy of the richest and broadest kind, and the
easy handling throughout of a master in his art. We
place the picture by the side of those of the great
writers of this style, of fiction in our language, and it
does not fall by the comparison.</p>

<p>Of what the reception of the book had been up to
this time, and of the popularity Dickens had won as its
author, this also will be the proper place to speak. For
its kind, its extent, and the absence of everything unreal
or factitious in the causes that contributed to it, it
is unexampled in literature. Here was a series of
sketches, without the pretense to such interest as attends
a well-constructed story; put forth in a form apparently
ephemeral as its purpose; having none that
seemed higher than to exhibit some studies of cockney
manners with help from a comic artist; and after four
or five parts had appeared, without newspaper notice
or puffing, and itself not subserving in the public anything
false or unworthy, it sprang into a popularity that
each part carried higher and higher, until people at this
time talked of nothing else, tradesmen recommended
their goods by using its name, and its sale, outstripping
at a bound that of all the most famous books of the
century, had reached to an almost fabulous number.
Of part one, the binder prepared four hundred; and
of part fifteen, his order was for more than forty thousand.
Every class, the high equally with the low, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
attracted to it. The charm of its gayety and good humor,
its inexhaustible fun, its riotous overflow of animal
spirits, its brightness and keenness of observation, and,
above all, the incomparable ease of its many varieties
of enjoyment, fascinated everybody. Judges on the
bench and boys in the street, gravity and folly, the
young and the old, those who were entering life and
those who were quitting it, alike found it to be irresistible.
"An archdeacon," wrote Mr. Carlyle afterwards
to me, "with his own venerable lips, repeated to me,
the other night, a strange profane story: of a solemn
clergyman who had been administering ghostly consolation
to a sick person; having finished, satisfactorily
as he thought, and got out of the room, he heard the
sick person ejaculate, 'Well, thank God, <i>Pickwick</i> will
be out in ten days any way!'&mdash;This is dreadful."</p>

<p>Let me add that there was something more in it all
than the gratification of mere fun and laughter, more
even than the rarer pleasure that underlies the outbreak
of all forms of genuine humor. Another chord had
been struck. Over and above the lively painting of
manners which at first had been so attractive, there was
something that left deeper mark. Genial and irrepressible
enjoyment, affectionate heartiness of tone,
unrestrained exuberance of mirth, these are not more
delightful than they are fleeting and perishable qualities;
but the attention eagerly excited by the charm of
them in <i>Pickwick</i> found itself retained by something
more permanent. We had all become suddenly conscious,
in the very thick of the extravaganza of adventure
and fun set before us, that here were real people.
It was not somebody talking humorously about them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
but they were there themselves. That a number of
persons belonging to the middle and lower ranks of life
(Wardles, Winkles, Wellers, Tupmans, Bardells, Snubbinses,
Perkers, Bob Sawyers, Dodsons, and Foggs) had
been somehow added to his intimate and familiar
acquaintance, the ordinary reader knew before half a
dozen numbers were out; and it took not many more
to make clear to the intelligent reader that a new and
original genius in the walk of Smollett and Fielding
had arisen in England.</p>

<p>I do not, for reasons to be hereafter stated, think the
<i>Pickwick Papers</i> comparable to the later books; but,
apart from the new vein of humor it opened, its wonderful
freshness and its unflagging animal spirits, it has
two characters that will probably continue to attract to
it an unfading popularity. Its pre-eminent achievement
is of course Sam Weller,&mdash;one of those people
that take their place among the supreme successes of
fiction, as one that nobody ever saw but everybody
recognizes, at once perfectly natural and intensely
original. Who is there that has ever thought him
tedious? Who is so familiar with him as not still to be
finding something new in him? Who is so amazed by
his inexhaustible resources, or so amused by his inextinguishable
laughter, as to doubt of his being as ordinary
and perfect a reality, nevertheless, as anything in
the London streets? When indeed the relish has been
dulled that makes such humor natural and appreciable,
and not his native fun only, his ready and rich illustration,
his imperturbable self-possession, but his devotion
to his master, his chivalry and his gallantry, are no
longer discovered, or believed no longer to exist, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the ranks of life to which he belongs, it will be worse
for all of us than for the fame of his creator. Nor,
when faith is lost in that possible combination of eccentricities
and benevolences, shrewdness and simplicity,
good sense and folly, all that suggests the ludicrous and
nothing that suggests contempt for it, which form the
delightful oddity of Pickwick, will the mistake committed
be one merely of critical misjudgment. But of
this there is small fear. Sam Weller and Mr. Pickwick
are the Sancho and the Quixote of Londoners, and as
little likely to pass away as the old city itself.</p>

<p>Dickens was very fond of riding in these early years,
and there was no recreation he so much indulged, or
with such profit to himself, in the intervals of his
hardest work. I was his companion oftener than I
could well afford the time for, the distances being great
and nothing else to be done for the day; but when a
note would unexpectedly arrive while I knew him to be
hunted hard by one of his printers, telling me he had
been sticking to work so closely that he must have
rest, and, by way of getting it, proposing we should
start together that morning at eleven o'clock for "a
fifteen-mile ride out, ditto in, and a lunch on the
road" with a wind-up of six o'clock dinner in Doughty
Street, I could not resist the good fellowship. His
notion of finding rest from mental exertion in as much
bodily exertion of equal severity, continued with him
to the last; taking in the later years what I always
thought the too great strain of as many miles in walking
as he now took in the saddle, and too often indulging
it at night; for, though he was always passionately
fond of walking, he observed as yet a moderation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
in it, even accepting as sufficient my seven or eight
miles' companionship. "What a brilliant morning for
a country walk!" he would write, with not another
word in his dispatch. Or, "Is it possible that you
can't, oughtn't, shouldn't, mustn't, <i>won't</i> be tempted,
this gorgeous day?" Or, "I start precisely&mdash;precisely,
mind&mdash;at half-past one. Come, come, <i>come</i>, and walk
in the green lanes. You will work the better for it all
the week. Come! I shall expect you." Or, "You
don't feel disposed, do you, to muffle yourself up and
start off with me for a good brisk walk over Hampstead
Heath? I knows a good 'ous there where we
can have a red-hot chop for dinner, and a glass of good
wine:" which led to our first experience of Jack
Straw's Castle, memorable for many happy meetings in
coming years. But the rides were most popular and
frequent. "I think," he would write, "Richmond and
Twickenham, thro' the park, out at Knightsbridge, and
over Barnes Common, would make a beautiful ride."
Or, "Do you know, I shouldn't object to an early
chop at some village inn?" Or, "Not knowing whether
my head was off or on, it became so addled with work,
I have gone riding the old road, and should be truly
delighted to meet or be overtaken by you." Or,
"Where shall it be&mdash;<i>oh, where</i>&mdash;Hampstead, Greenwich,
Windsor? <span class="smcap">where</span>?????? while the day is
bright, not when it has dwindled away to nothing!
For who can be of any use whatsomdever such a day
as this, excepting out of doors?" Or it might be interrogatory
summons to "A hard trot of three hours?"
or intimation as laconic "To be heard of at Eel-pie
House, Twickenham!" When first I knew him, I may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
add, his carriage for his wife's use was a small chaise
with a smaller pair of ponies, which, having a habit
of making sudden rushes up by-streets in the day and
peremptory standstills in ditches by night, were changed
in the following year for a more suitable equipage.</p>

<p>To this mention of his habits while at work when our
friendship began, I have to add what will complete the
relation already given, in connection with his <i>Sketches</i>,
of the uneasy sense accompanying his labor that it was
yielding insufficient for himself while it enriched others,
which is a needful part of his story at this time. At
midsummer, 1837, replying to some inquiries, and sending
his agreement with Mr. Bentley for the <i>Miscellany</i>
under which he was writing <i>Oliver</i>, he went on: "It
is a very extraordinary fact (I forgot it on Sunday) that
I have <span class="smcap">never had</span> from him a copy of the agreement
respecting the novel, which I never saw before or since
I signed it at his house one morning long ago. Shall
I ask him for a copy or no? I have looked at some
memoranda I made at the time, and I <i>fear</i> he has my
second novel on the same terms, under the same agreement.
This is a bad lookout, but we must try and
mend it. You will tell me you are very much surprised
at my doing business in this way. So am I, for in most
matters of labor and application I am punctuality
itself. The truth is (though you do not need I should
explain the matter to you, my dear fellow), that if I
had allowed myself to be worried by these things, I
could never have done as much as I have. But I
much fear, in my desire to avoid present vexations,
I have laid up a bitter store for the future." The
second novel, which he had promised in a complete form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
for a very early date, and had already selected subject
and title for, was published four years later as <i>Barnaby
Rudge;</i> but of the third he at present knew nothing but
that he was expected to begin it, if not in the magazine,
somewhere or other independently within a specified
time.</p>

<p>The first appeal made, in taking action upon his letter,
had reference to the immediate pressure of the <i>Barnaby</i>
novel; but it also opened up the question of the great
change of circumstances since these various agreements
had been precipitately signed by him, the very different
situation brought about by the extraordinary increase
in the popularity of his writings, and the advantage it
would be to both Mr. Bentley and himself to make more
equitable adjustment of their relations. Some misunderstandings
followed, but were closed by a compromise in
September, 1837; by which the third novel was abandoned<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
on certain conditions, and <i>Barnaby</i> was undertaken
to be finished by November, 1838. This involved
a completion of the new story during the progress of
<i>Oliver</i>, whatever might be required to follow on the
close of <i>Pickwick;</i> and I doubted its wisdom. But it
was accepted for the time.</p>

<p>He had meanwhile taken his wife abroad for a ten
days' summer holiday, accompanied by the shrewd
observant young artist, Mr. Hablot Browne, whose
admirable illustrations to <i>Pickwick</i> had more than supplied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Mr. Seymour's loss; and I had a letter from him
on their landing at Calais on the 2d of July:</p>

<p>"We have arranged for a post-coach to take us to
Ghent, Brussels, Antwerp, and a hundred other places,
that I cannot recollect now and couldn't spell if I did.
We went this afternoon in a barouche to some gardens
where the people dance, and where they were footing it
most heartily,&mdash;especially the women, who in their short
petticoats and light caps look uncommonly agreeable.
A gentleman in a blue surtout and silken berlins accompanied
us from the hotel, and acted as curator. He even
waltzed with a very smart lady (just to show us, condescendingly,
how it ought to be done), and waltzed
elegantly, too. We rang for slippers after we came back,
and it turned out that this gentleman was the Boots."</p>

<p>His later sea-side holiday was passed at Broadstairs,
as were those of many subsequent years, and the little
watering-place has been made memorable by his pleasant
sketch of it. From his letters to myself a few lines may
be given of his first doings and impressions there.</p>

<p>Writing on the 3d of September, he reports himself
just risen from an attack of illness. "I am much better,
and hope to begin <i>Pickwick No. 18</i> to-morrow. You
will imagine how queer I must have been when I tell
you that I have been compelled for four-and-twenty
mortal hours to abstain from porter or other malt
liquor!!! I have done it though&mdash;really.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have
discovered that the landlord of the Albion has delicious
hollands (but what is that to <i>you?</i> for you cannot sympathize
with my feelings), and that a cobbler who lives
opposite to my bedroom window is a Roman Catholic,
and gives an hour and a half to his devotions every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
morning behind his counter. I have walked upon the
sands at low-water from this place to Ramsgate, and sat
upon the same at high-ditto till I have been flayed with
the cold. I have seen ladies and gentlemen walking
upon the earth in slippers of buff, and pickling themselves
in the sea in complete suits of the same. I have
seen stout gentlemen looking at nothing through powerful
telescopes for hours, and, when at last they saw a
cloud of smoke, fancying a steamer behind it, and going
home comfortable and happy. I have found out that
our next neighbor has a wife and something else under
the same roof with the rest of his furniture,&mdash;the wife
deaf and blind, and the something else given to drinking.
And if you ever get to the end of this letter <i>you</i>
will find out that I subscribe myself on paper, as on
everything else (some atonement perhaps for its length
and absurdity)," etc. etc.</p>

<p>In his next letter (from 12, High Street, Broadstairs,
on the 7th) there is allusion to one of the many piracies
of <i>Pickwick</i>, which had distinguished itself beyond the
rest by a preface abusive of the writer plundered: "I
recollect this 'member of the Dramatic Authors' Society'
bringing an action once against Chapman who rented
the City theatre, in which it was proved that he had
undertaken to write under special agreement seven
melodramas for five pounds, to enable him to do which
a room had been hired in a gin-shop close by. The
defendant's plea was that the plaintiff was always drunk,
and had not fulfilled his contract. Well, if the <i>Pickwick</i>
has been the means of putting a few shillings in the
vermin-eaten pockets of so miserable a creature, and has
saved him from a workhouse or a jail, let him empty out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
his little pot of filth and welcome. I am quite content
to have been the means of relieving him. Besides, he
seems to have suffered by agreements!"</p>

<p>His own troubles in that way were compromised for
the time, as already hinted, at the close of this September
month; and at the end of the month following,
after finishing <i>Pickwick</i> and resuming <i>Oliver</i>, the latter
having been suspended by him during the recent disputes,
he made his first visit to Brighton. The opening
of his letter of Friday the 3d of November is full of
regrets that I had been unable to join them there: "It
is a beautiful day, and we have been taking advantage
of it, but the wind until to-day has been so high and
the weather so stormy that Kate has been scarcely able
to peep out of doors. On Wednesday it blew a perfect
hurricane, breaking windows, knocking down shutters,
carrying people off their legs, blowing the fires out, and
causing universal consternation. The air was for some
hours darkened with a shower of black hats (second-hand),
which are supposed to have been blown off the
heads of unwary passengers in remote parts of the town,
and have been industriously picked up by the fishermen.
Charles Kean was advertised for <i>Othello</i> 'for the
benefit of Mrs. Sefton, having most kindly postponed
for this one day his departure for London.' I have not
heard whether he got to the theatre, but I am sure
nobody else did. They do <i>The Honeymoon</i> to-night,
on which occasion I mean to patronize the drayma.
We have a beautiful bay-windowed sitting-room here,
fronting the sea, but I have seen nothing of B.'s
brother who was to have shown me the lions, and my
notions of the place are consequently somewhat confined:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
being limited to the pavilion, the chain-pier,
and the sea. The last is quite enough for me, and,
unless I am joined by some male companion (<i>do you
think I shall be?</i>), is most probably all I shall make
acquaintance with. I am glad you like <i>Oliver</i> this
month: especially glad that you particularize the first
chapter. I hope to do great things with Nancy. If I
can only work out the idea I have formed of her, and
of the female who is to contrast with her, I think I
may defy Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and all his works.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> I have had
great difficulty in keeping my hands off Fagin and the
rest of them in the evenings; but, as I came down for
rest, I have resisted the temptation, and steadily applied
myself to the labor of being idle. Did you ever read
(of course you have, though) De Foe's <i>History of the
Devil?</i> What a capital thing it is! I bought it for a
couple of shillings yesterday morning, and have been
quite absorbed in it ever since. We must have been
jolter-headed geniuses not to have anticipated M.'s
reply. My best remembrances to him. I see H. at
this moment. I must be present at a rehearsal of that
opera. It will be better than any comedy that was
ever played. Talking of comedies, I still see <span class="smcap">No
Thoroughfare</span> staring me in the face, every time I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
look down that road. I have taken places for Tuesday
next. We shall be at home at six o'clock, and I shall
hope at least to see you that evening. I am afraid you
will find this letter extremely dear at eightpence, but
if the warmest assurances of friendship and attachment,
and anxious lookings-forward to the pleasure of your
society, be worth anything, throw them into the balance,
together with a hundred good wishes and one
hearty assurance that I am," etc. etc. "<span class="smcap">Charles Dickens</span>.
No room for the flourish&mdash;I'll finish it the next
time I write to you."</p>

<p>The flourish that accompanied his signature is familiar
to every one. The allusion to the comedy expresses a
fancy he at this time had of being able to contribute
some such achievement in aid of Macready's gallant
efforts at Covent Garden to bring back to the stage its
higher associations of good literature and intellectual
enjoyment. It connects curiously now that unrealized
hope with the exact title of the only story he ever helped
himself to dramatize, and which Mr. Fechter played
at the Adelphi three years before his death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> remotely bearing on the stage, nevertheless, was
the employment on which I found him busy at his return
from Brighton; one result of his more satisfactory
relations with Mr. Bentley having led to a promise to
edit for him a life of the celebrated clown Grimaldi.
The manuscript had been prepared from autobiographical
notes by a Mr. Egerton Wilks, and contained one or two
stories told so badly, and so well worth better telling,
that the hope of enlivening their dullness at the cost of
very little labor constituted a sort of attraction for him.
Except the preface, he did not write a line of this biography,
such modifications or additions as he made
having been dictated by him to his father; whom I
found often in the supreme enjoyment of the office of
amanuensis. He had also a most indifferent opinion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the mass of material which in general composed it, describing
it to me as "twaddle," and his own modest
estimate of the book, on its completion, may be guessed
from the number of notes of admiration (no less than
thirty) which accompanied his written mention to
me of the sale with which it started in the first week
of its publication: "Seventeen hundred <i>Grimaldis</i>
have been already sold, and the demand increases
daily!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p>

<p>It was not to have all its own way, however. A great
many critical faults were found; and one point in particular
was urged against his handling such a subject,
that he could never himself even have seen Grimaldi.
To this last objection he was moved to reply, and had
prepared a letter for the <i>Miscellany</i>, "from editor to
sub-editor," which it was thought best to suppress, but
of which the opening remark may now be not unamusing:
"I understand that a gentleman unknown is going
about this town privately informing all ladies and gentlemen
of discontented natures, that, on a comparison
of dates and putting together of many little circumstances
which occur to his great sagacity, he has made
the profound discovery that I can never have seen
Grimaldi whose life I have edited, and that the book
must therefore of necessity be bad. Now, sir, although
I was brought up from remote country parts in the dark
ages of 1819 and 1820 to behold the splendor of Christmas
pantomimes and the humor of Joe, in whose honor
I am informed I clapped my hands with great precocity,
and although I even saw him act in the remote times
of 1823, yet as I had not then aspired to the dignity
of a tail-coat, though forced by a relentless parent into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
my first pair of boots, I am willing, with the view of
saving this honest gentleman further time and trouble,
to concede that I had not arrived at man's estate when
Grimaldi left the stage, and that my recollections of
his acting are, to my loss, but shadowy and imperfect.
Which confession I now make publickly, and without
mental qualification or reserve, to all whom it may concern.
But the deduction of this pleasant gentleman
that therefore the Grimaldi book must be bad, I must
take leave to doubt. I don't think that to edit a man's
biography from his own notes it is essential you should
have known him, and I don't believe that Lord Braybrooke
had more than the very slightest acquaintance
with Mr. Pepys, whose memoirs he edited two centuries
after he died."</p>

<p>Enormous meanwhile, and without objection audible
on any side, had been the success of the completed
<i>Pickwick</i>, which we celebrated by a dinner, with himself
in the chair and Talfourd in the vice-chair, everybody
in hearty good humor with every other body;
and a copy of which I received from him on the 11th
of December in the most luxurious of Hayday's bindings,
with a note worth preserving for its closing allusion.
The passage referred to in it was a comment, in
delicately chosen words, that Leigh Hunt had made on
the inscription at the grave in Kensal Green:<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> "Chapman
&amp; Hall have just sent me, with a copy of our deed,
three 'extra-super' bound copies of <i>Pickwick</i>, as per
specimen inclosed. The first I forward to you, the
second I have presented to our good friend Ainsworth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and the third Kate has retained for herself. Accept
your copy with one sincere and most comprehensive
expression of my warmest friendship and esteem; and
a hearty renewal, if there need be any renewal when
there has been no interruption, of all those assurances
of affectionate regard which our close friendship and
communion for a long time back has every day implied.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
That beautiful passage you were so kind and
considerate as to send me, has given me the only feeling
akin to pleasure (sorrowful pleasure it is) that I
have yet had, connected with the loss of my dear young
friend and companion; for whom my love and attachment
will never diminish, and by whose side, if it
please God to leave me in possession of sense to signify
my wishes, my bones, whenever or wherever I die, will
one day be laid. Tell Leigh Hunt when you have an
opportunity how much he has affected me, and how
deeply I thank him for what he has done. You cannot
say it too strongly."</p>

<p>The "deed" mentioned was one executed in the previous
month to restore to him a third ownership in the
book which had thus far enriched all concerned but
himself. The original understanding respecting it Mr.
Edward Chapman thus describes for me: "There was
no agreement about <i>Pickwick</i> except a verbal one.
Each number was to consist of a sheet and a half, for
which we were to pay fifteen guineas; and we paid him
for the first two numbers at once, as he required the
money to go and get married with. We were also to
pay more according to the sale, and I think <i>Pickwick</i>
altogether cost us three thousand pounds." Adjustment
to the sale would have cost four times as much,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and of the actual payments I have myself no note;
but, as far as my memory serves, they are overstated
by Mr. Chapman. My impression is that, above and
beyond the first sum due for each of the twenty numbers
(making no allowance for their extension after the
first to thirty-two pages), successive checks were given,
as the work went steadily on to the enormous sale it
reached, which brought up the entire sum received to two
thousand five hundred pounds. I had, however, always
pressed so strongly the importance to him of some
share in the copyright, that this at last was conceded
in the deed above mentioned, though five years were
to elapse before the right should accrue; and it was
only yielded as part consideration for a further agreement
entered into at the same date (the 19th of November,
1837), whereby Dickens engaged to "write a
new work, the title whereof shall be determined by
him, of a similar character and of the same extent as
the <i>Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club</i>," the first
number of which was to be delivered on the 15th of
the following March, and each of the numbers on the
same day of each of the successive nineteen months;
which was also to be the date of the payment to him,
by Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall, of twenty several sums
of one hundred and fifty pounds each for five years'
use of the copyright, the entire ownership in which
was then to revert to Dickens. The name of this
new book, as all the world knows, was <i>The Life and
Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby;</i> and between April,
1838, and October, 1839, it was begun and finished
accordingly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>All through the interval of these arrangements <i>Oliver
Twist</i> had been steadily continued. Month by month,
for many months, it had run its opening course with
the close of <i>Pickwick</i>, as we shall see it close with the
opening of <i>Nickleby;</i> and the expectations of those
who had built most confidently on the young novelist
were more than confirmed. Here was the interest of a
story simply but well constructed; and characters with
the same impress of reality upon them, but more carefully
and skillfully drawn. Nothing could be meaner
than the subject, the progress of a parish or workhouse
boy, nothing less so than its treatment. As each number
appeared, his readers generally became more and more
conscious of what already, as we have seen, had revealed
itself amid even the riotous fun of <i>Pickwick</i>,
that the purpose was not solely to amuse; and, far more
decisively than its predecessor, the new story further
showed what were the not least potent elements in the
still increasing popularity that was gathering around
the writer. His qualities could be appreciated as well
as felt in an almost equal degree by all classes of his
various readers. Thousands were attracted to him
because he placed them in the midst of scenes and
characters with which they were already themselves
acquainted; and thousands were reading him with no
less avidity because he introduced them to passages of
nature and life of which they before knew nothing, but
of the truth of which their own habits and senses
sufficed to assure them. Only to genius are so revealed
the affinities and sympathies of high and low, in regard
to the customs and usages of life; and only a writer
of the first rank can bear the application of such a test.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
For it is by the alliance of common habits, quite as
much as by the bonds of a common humanity, that we
are all of us linked together; and the result of being
above the necessity of depending on other people's
opinions, and that of being below it, are pretty much
the same. It would equally startle both high and low
to be conscious of the whole that is implied in this
close approximation; but for the common enjoyment
of which I speak such consciousness is not required;
and for the present Fagin may be left undisturbed in
his school of practical ethics with only the Dodger,
Charley Bates, and his other promising scholars.</p>

<p>With such work as this in hand, it will hardly seem
surprising that as the time for beginning <i>Nickleby</i> came
on, and as he thought of his promise for November, he
should have the sense of "something hanging over him
like a hideous nightmare." He felt that he could not
complete the <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> novel by the November
of that year, as promised, and that the engagement he
would have to break was unfitting him for engagements
he might otherwise fulfill. He had undertaken what,
in truth, was impossible. The labor of at once editing
the <i>Miscellany</i> and supplying it with monthly portions
of <i>Oliver</i> more than occupied all the time left him by
other labors absolutely necessary. "I no sooner get
myself up," he wrote, "high and dry, to attack <i>Oliver</i>
manfully, than up come the waves of each month's
work, and drive me back again into a sea of manuscript."
There was nothing for it but that he should
make further appeal to Mr. Bentley. "I have recently,"
he wrote to him on the 11th of February,
1838, "been thinking a great deal about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> <i>Barnaby
Rudge</i>. <i>Grimaldi</i> has occupied so much of the short
interval I had between the completion of the <i>Pickwick</i>
and the commencement of the new work, that I see it
will be wholly impossible for me to produce it by the
time I had hoped, with justice to myself or profit to
you. What I wish you to consider is this: would it
not be far more to your interest, as well as within the
scope of my ability, if <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> began in the
<i>Miscellany</i> immediately on the conclusion of <i>Oliver
Twist</i>, and were continued there for the same time,
and then published in three volumes? Take these
simple facts into consideration. If the <i>Miscellany</i> is to
keep its ground, it <i>must</i> have some continuous tale from
me when <i>Oliver</i> stops. If I sat down to <i>Barnaby
Rudge</i>, writing a little of it when I could (and with
all my other engagements it would necessarily be a very
long time before I could hope to finish it that way),
it would be clearly impossible for me to begin a new
series of papers in the <i>Miscellany</i>. The conduct of
three different stories at the same time, and the production
of a large portion of each, every month, would
have been beyond Scott himself. Whereas, having
<i>Barnaby</i> for the <i>Miscellany</i>, we could at once supply
the gap which the cessation of <i>Oliver</i> must create, and
you would have all the advantage of that prestige in
favor of the work which is certain to enhance the value
of <i>Oliver Twist</i> considerably. Just think of this at
your leisure. I am really anxious to do the best I can
for you as well as for myself, and in this case the
pecuniary advantage must be all on your side." This
letter nevertheless, which had also requested an overdue
account of the sales of the <i>Miscellany</i>, led to differences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
which were only adjusted after six months'
wrangling; and I was party to the understanding then
arrived at, by which, among other things, <i>Barnaby</i>
was placed upon the footing desired, and was to begin
when <i>Oliver</i> closed.</p>

<p>Of the progress of his <i>Oliver</i>, and his habits of writing
at the time, it may perhaps be worth giving some additional
glimpses from his letters of 1838. "I was thinking
about <i>Oliver</i> till dinner-time yesterday," he wrote
on the 9th of March,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> "and, just as I had fallen upon
him tooth and nail, was called away to sit with Kate.
I did eight slips, however, and hope to make them
fifteen this morning." Three days before, a little
daughter had been born to him, who became a little
god-daughter to me; on which occasion (having closed
his announcement with a postscript of "I can do nothing
this morning. What time will you ride? The
sooner the better, for a good long spell"), we rode out
fifteen miles on the great north road, and, after dining
at the Red Lion in Barnet on our way home, distinguished
the already memorable day by bringing in both
hacks dead lame.</p>

<p>On that day week, Monday, the 13th, after describing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
himself "sitting patiently at home waiting for
<i>Oliver Twist</i> who has not yet arrived," which was his
pleasant form of saying that his fancy had fallen into
sluggishness that morning, he made addition not less
pleasant as to some piece of painful news I had sent
him, now forgotten: "I have not yet seen the paper,
and you throw me into a fever. The comfort is, that
all the strange and terrible things come uppermost, and
that the good and pleasant things are mixed up with
every moment of our existence so plentifully that we
scarcely heed them." At the close of the month Mrs.
Dickens was well enough to accompany him to Richmond,
for now the time was come to start <i>Nickleby;</i>
and, having been away from town when <i>Pickwick's</i>
first number came out, he made it a superstition to be
absent at all future similar times. The magazine-day
of that April month, I remember, fell upon a Saturday,
and the previous evening had brought me a peremptory
summons: "Meet me at the Shakspeare on Saturday
night at eight; order your horse at midnight, and ride
back with me." Which was done accordingly. The
smallest hour was sounding from St. Paul's into the
night before we started, and the night was none of the
pleasantest; but we carried news that lightened every
part of the road, for the sale of <i>Nickleby</i> had reached
that day the astonishing number of nearly fifty thousand!
I left him working with unusual cheerfulness at
<i>Oliver Twist</i> when I left the Star and Garter on the
next day but one, after celebrating with both friends
on the previous evening an anniversary<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> which concerned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
us all (their second and my twenty-sixth), and
which we kept always in future at the same place, except
when they were living out of England, for twenty
successive years. It was a part of his love of regularity
and order, as well as of his kindliness of nature, to
place such friendly meetings as these under rules of
habit and continuance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> whole of his time not occupied by <i>Nickleby</i> was
now given to <i>Oliver</i>, and as the story shaped itself to
its close it took extraordinary hold of him. I never
knew him work so frequently after dinner, or to such
late hours (a practice he afterwards abhorred), as during
the final months of this task; which it was now his hope
to complete before October, though its close in the
magazine would not be due until the following March.
"I worked pretty well last night," he writes, referring
to it in May, "very well indeed; but, although I did
eleven close slips before half-past twelve, I have four to
write to complete the chapter; and, as I foolishly left
them till this morning, have the steam to get up afresh."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
A month later he writes, "I got to the sixteenth slip
last night, and shall try hard to get to the thirtieth before
I go to bed."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Then, on a "Tuesday night," at
the opening of August, he wrote, "Hard at work still.
Nancy is no more. I showed what I have done to Kate
last night, who was in an unspeakable '<i>state:</i>' from
which and my own impression I augur well. When I
have sent Sikes to the devil, I must have yours." "No,
no," he wrote, in the following month: "don't, don't
let us ride till to-morrow, not having yet disposed of
the Jew, who is such an out-and-outer that I don't know
what to make of him." No small difficulty to an inventor,
where the creatures of his invention are found
to be as real as himself; but this also was mastered;
and then there remained but the closing quiet chapter
to tell the fortunes of those who had figured in the tale.
To this he summoned me in the first week of September,
replying to a request of mine that he'd give me a
call that day: "Come and give <i>me</i> a call, and let us
have 'a bit o' talk' before we have a bit o' som'at else.
My missis is going out to dinner, and I ought to go, but
I have got a bad cold. So do you come, and sit here,
and read, or work, or do something, while I write the
LAST chapter of <i>Oliver</i>, which will be arter a lamb
chop." How well I remember that evening! and our
talk of what should be the fate of Charley Bates, on
behalf of whom (as indeed for the Dodger too) Talfourd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
had pleaded as earnestly in mitigation of judgment
as ever at the bar for any client he had most
respected.</p>

<p>The publication had been announced for October,
but the third-volume illustrations intercepted it a little.
This part of the story, as we have seen, had been
written in anticipation of the magazine, and the designs
for it, having to be executed "in a lump," were
necessarily done somewhat hastily. The matter supplied
in advance of the monthly portions in the magazine
formed the bulk of the last volume as published
in the book; and for this the plates had to be prepared
by Cruikshank also in advance of the magazine, to furnish
them in time for the separate publication: Sikes
and his dog, Fagin in the cell, and Rose Maylie and
Oliver, being the three last. None of these Dickens
had seen until he saw them in the book on the eve of
its publication; when he so strongly objected to one
of them that it had to be canceled. "I returned suddenly
to town yesterday afternoon," he wrote to the
artist at the end of October, "to look at the latter
pages of <i>Oliver Twist</i> before it was delivered to the
booksellers, when I saw the majority of the plates in
the last volume for the first time. With reference to
the last one,&mdash;Rose Maylie and Oliver,&mdash;without entering
into the question of great haste, or any other cause,
which may have led to its being what it is, I am quite
sure there can be little difference of opinion between
us with respect to the result. May I ask you whether
you will object to designing this plate afresh, and doing
so <i>at once</i>, in order that as few impressions as possible
of the present one may go forth? I feel confident you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
know me too well to feel hurt by this inquiry, and with
equal confidence in you I have lost no time in preferring
it." This letter, printed from a copy in Dickens's
handwriting fortunately committed to my keeping,
entirely disposes of a wonderful story<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> originally promulgated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
in America with a minute particularity of
detail that might have raised the reputation of Sir Benjamin
Backbite himself. Whether all Sir Benjamin's
laurels, however, should fall to the person by whom
the tale is told,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> or whether any part belongs to the authority
alleged for it, is unfortunately not quite clear.
There would hardly have been a doubt, if the fable
had been confined to the other side of the Atlantic;
but it has been reproduced and widely circulated on
this side also; and the distinguished artist whom it
calumniates by attributing the invention to him has
been left undefended from its slander. Dickens's
letter spares me the necessity of characterizing, by the
only word which would have been applicable to it, a
tale of such incredible and monstrous absurdity as that
one of the masterpieces of its author's genius had been
merely an illustration of etchings by Mr. Cruikshank!</p>

<p>The completed <i>Oliver Twist</i> found a circle of admirers,
not so wide in its range as those of others of
his books, but of a character and mark that made their
honest liking for it, and steady advocacy of it, important
to his fame; and the book has held its ground
in the first class of his writings. It deserves that place.
The admitted exaggerations in <i>Pickwick</i> are incident<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to its club's extravaganza of adventure, of which they
are part, and are easily separable from the reality of its
wit and humor, and its incomparable freshness; but no
such allowances were needed here. Make what deduction
the too scrupulous reader of <i>Oliver</i> might
please for "lowness" in the subject, the precision and
the unexaggerated force of the delineation were not to
be disputed. The art of copying from nature as it
really exists in the common walks had not been carried
by any one to greater perfection, or to better
results in the way of combination. Such was his
handling of the piece of solid, existing, every-day life,
which he made here the groundwork of his wit and
tenderness, that the book which did much to help out
of the world the social evils it portrayed will probably
preserve longest the picture of them as they then were.
Thus far, indeed, he had written nothing to which in a
greater or less degree this felicity did not belong. At
the time of which I am speaking, the debtors' prisons
described in <i>Pickwick</i>, the parochial management denounced
in <i>Oliver</i>, and the Yorkshire schools exposed
in <i>Nickleby</i>, were all actual existences,&mdash;which now
have no vivider existence than in the forms he thus
gave to them. With wiser purposes, he superseded the
old petrifying process of the magician in the Arabian
tale, and struck the prisons and parish abuses of his
country, and its schools of neglect and crime, into
palpable life forever. A portion of the truth of the
past, of the character and very history of the moral
abuses of his time, will thus remain always in his
writings; and it will be remembered that with only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the light arms of humor and laughter, and the gentle
ones of pathos and sadness, he carried cleansing and
reform into those Augean stables.</p>

<p>Not that such intentions are in any degree ever intruded
by this least didactic of writers. It is the fact
that teaches, and not any sermonizing drawn from it.
<i>Oliver Twist</i> is the history of a child born in a workhouse
and brought up by parish overseers, and there is
nothing introduced that is out of keeping with the design.
It is a series of pictures from the tragi-comedy
of lower life, worked out by perfectly natural agencies,
from the dying mother and the starved wretches of the
first volume, through the scenes and gradations of
crime, careless or deliberate, which have a frightful
consummation in the last volume, but are never without
the reliefs and self-assertions of humanity even in
scenes and among characters so debased. It is indeed
the primary purpose of the tale to show its little hero,
jostled as he is in the miserable crowd, preserved
everywhere from the vice of its pollution by an exquisite
delicacy of natural sentiment which clings to
him under every disadvantage. There is not a more
masterly touch in fiction, and it is by such that this
delightful fancy is consistently worked out to the last,
than Oliver's agony of childish grief on being brought
away from the branch-workhouse, the wretched home
associated only with suffering and starvation, and with
no kind word or look, but containing still his little
companions in misery.</p>

<p>Of the figures the book has made familiar to every
one it is not my purpose to speak. To name one or
two will be enough. Bumble and his wife; Charley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Bates and the Artful Dodger; the cowardly charity-boy,
Noah Claypole, whose <i>Such agony, please, sir</i>, puts the
whole of a school-life into one phrase; the so-called
merry old Jew, supple and black-hearted Fagin; and
Bill Sikes, the bolder-faced bulky-legged ruffian, with
his white hat and white shaggy dog,&mdash;who does not
know them all, even to the least points of dress, look,
and walk, and all the small peculiarities that express
great points of character? I have omitted poor
wretched Nancy; yet it is to be said of her, with such
honest truthfulness her strength and weakness are
shown, in the virtue that lies neighbored in her nature
so closely by vice, that the people meant to be entirely
virtuous show poorly beside her. But, though
Rose and her lover are trivial enough beside Bill and
his mistress, being indeed the weak part of the story,
it is the book's pre-eminent merit that vice is nowhere
made attractive in it. Crime is not more intensely
odious, all through, than it is also most wretched and
most unhappy. Not merely when its exposure comes,
when the latent recesses of guilt are laid bare, and all
the agonies of remorse are witnessed; not in the great
scenes only, but in those lighter passages where no
such aim might seem to have guided the apparently
careless hand, this is emphatically so. Whether it be
the comedy or the tragedy of crime, terror and retribution
dog closely at its heels. They are as plainly visible
when Fagin is first shown in his den, boiling the
coffee in the saucepan and stopping every now and
then to listen when there is the least noise below,&mdash;the
villainous confidence of habit never extinguishing in
him the anxious watchings and listenings of crime,&mdash;as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
when we see him at the last in the condemned cell,
like a poisoned human rat in a hole.</p>

<p>A word may be added upon the attacks directed
against the subject of the book, to which Dickens made
reply in one of his later editions, declaring his belief
that he had tried to do a service to society, and had
certainly done no disservice, in depicting a knot of
such associates in crime in all their deformity and squalid
wretchedness, skulking uneasily through a miserable life
to a painful and shameful death. It is, indeed, never
the subject that can be objectionable, if the treatment is
not so, as we may see by much popular writing since,
where subjects unimpeachably high are brought low by
degrading sensualism. When the object of a writer is
to exhibit the vulgarity of vice, and not its pretensions
to heroism or cravings for sympathy, he may measure
his subject with the highest. We meet with a succession
of swindlers and thieves in <i>Gil Blas;</i> we shake
hands with highwaymen and housebreakers all round in
the <i>Beggars' Opera;</i> we pack cards with La Ruse or
pick pockets with Jonathan in Fielding's <i>Mr. Wild the
Great;</i> we follow cruelty and vice from its least beginning
to its grossest ends in the prints of Hogarth; but
our morals stand none the looser for any of them. As
the spirit of the Frenchman was pure enjoyment, the
strength of the Englishmen lay in wisdom and satire.
The low was set forth to pull down the false pretensions
of the high. And though for the most part they differ
in manner and design from Dickens in this tale, desiring
less to discover the soul of goodness in things evil
than to brand the stamp of evil on things apt to pass for
good, their objects and results are substantially the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Familiar with the lowest kind of abasement of life, the
knowledge is used, by both him and them, to teach what
constitutes its essential elevation; and by the very coarseness
and vulgarity of the materials employed we measure
the gentlemanliness and beauty of the work that is done.
The quack in morality will always call such writing immoral,
and the impostors will continue to complain of
its treatment of imposture, but for the rest of the world
it will still teach the invaluable lesson of what men ought
to be from what they are. We cannot learn it more than
enough. We cannot too often be told that as the pride
and grandeur of mere external circumstance is the falsest
of earthly things, so the truth of virtue in the heart is
the most lovely and lasting; and from the pages of
<i>Oliver Twist</i> this teaching is once again to be taken by
all who will look for it there.</p>

<p>And now, while <i>Oliver</i> was running a great career of
popularity and success, the shadow of the tale of <i>Barnaby
Rudge</i>, which he was to write on similar terms,
and to begin in the <i>Miscellany</i> when the other should
have ended, began to darken everything around him.
We had much discussion respecting it, and I had no
small difficulty in restraining him from throwing up the
agreement altogether; but the real hardship of his position,
and the considerate construction to be placed on
every effort made by him to escape from obligations
incurred in ignorance of the sacrifices implied by them,
will be best understood from his own frank and honest
statement. On the 21st of January, 1839, inclosing
me the copy of a letter which he proposed to send to
Mr. Bentley the following morning, he thus wrote:
"From what I have already said to you, you will have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
been led to expect that I entertained some such intention.
I know you will not endeavor to dissuade me
from sending it. Go it <span class="smcap">must</span>. It is no fiction to say
that at present I <i>cannot</i> write this tale. The immense
profits which <i>Oliver</i> has realized to its publisher and is
still realizing; the paltry, wretched, miserable sum it
brought to me (not equal to what is every day paid for
a novel that sells fifteen hundred copies at most); the
recollection of this, and the consciousness that I have
still the slavery and drudgery of another work on the
same journeyman-terms; the consciousness that my
books are enriching everybody connected with them
but myself, and that I, with such a popularity as I have
acquired, am struggling in old toils, and wasting my
energies in the very height and freshness of my fame,
and the best part of my life, to fill the pockets of
others, while for those who are nearest and dearest to
me I can realize little more than a genteel subsistence:
all this puts me out of heart and spirits. And I cannot&mdash;cannot
and will not&mdash;under such circumstances
that keep me down with an iron hand, distress myself
by beginning this tale until I have had time to breathe,
and until the intervention of the summer, and some
cheerful days in the country, shall have restored me to
a more genial and composed state of feeling. There&mdash;for
six months <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> stands over. And but
for you, it should stand over altogether. For I do most
solemnly declare that morally, before God and man, I
hold myself released from such hard bargains as these,
after I have done so much for those who drove them.
This net that has been wound about me so chafes me,
so exasperates and irritates my mind, that to break it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
at whatever cost&mdash;<i>that</i> I should care nothing for&mdash;is my
constant impulse. But I have not yielded to it. I
merely declare that I must have a postponement very
common in all literary agreements; and for the time I
have mentioned&mdash;six months from the conclusion of
<i>Oliver</i> in the <i>Miscellany</i>&mdash;I wash my hands of any fresh
accumulation of labor, and resolve to proceed as cheerfully
as I can with that which already presses upon
me."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>To describe what followed upon this is not necessary.
It will suffice to state the results. Upon the
appearance in the <i>Miscellany</i>, in the early months of
1839, of the last portion of <i>Oliver Twist</i>, its author,
having been relieved altogether from his engagement
to the magazine, handed over, in a familiar epistle
from a parent to his child, the editorship to Mr. Ainsworth;
and the still subsisting agreement to write
<i>Barnaby Rudge</i> was, upon the overture of Mr. Bentley
himself in June of the following year, 1840, also put
an end to, on payment by Dickens, for the copyright
of <i>Oliver Twist</i> and such printed stock as remained of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the edition then on hand, of two thousand two hundred
and fifty pounds. What was further incident to this
transaction will be told hereafter; and a few words
may meanwhile be taken, not without significance in
regard to it, from the parent's familiar epistle. It describes
the child as aged two years and two months (so
long had he watched over it); gives sundry pieces of
advice concerning its circulation, and the importance
thereto of light and pleasant articles of food; and
concludes, after some general moralizing on the shiftings
and changes of this world having taken so wonderful
a turn that mail-coach guards were become no
longer judges of horse-flesh, "I reap no gain or profit
by parting from you, nor will any conveyance of your
property be required, for in this respect you have always
been literally Bentley's Miscellany and never mine."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I well</span> recollect the doubt there was, mixed with the
eager expectation which the announcement of his second
serial story had awakened, whether the event would justify
all that interest, and if indeed it were possible that
the young writer could continue to walk steadily under
the burden of the popularity laid upon him. The first
number dispersed this cloud of a question in a burst of
sunshine; and as much of the gayety of nations as had
been eclipsed by old Mr. Pickwick's voluntary exile to
Dulwich was restored by the cheerful confidence with
which young Mr. Nicholas Nickleby stepped into his
shoes. Everything that had given charm to the first
book was here, with more attention to the important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
requisite of a story, and more wealth as well as truth
of character.</p>

<p>How this was poured forth in each successive number,
it hardly needs that I should tell. To recall it now, is
to talk of what since has so interwoven itself with common
speech and thought as to have become almost part
of the daily life of us all. It was well said of him, soon
after his death, in mentioning how largely his compositions
had furnished one of the chief sources of intellectual
enjoyment to this generation, that his language
had become part of the language of every class and rank
of his countrymen, and his characters were a portion
of our contemporaries. "It seems scarcely possible,"
continued this otherwise not too indulgent commentator,
"to believe that there never were any such
persons as Mr. Pickwick and Mrs. Nickleby and Mrs.
Gamp. They are to us not only types of English life,
but types actually existing. They at once revealed the
existence of such people, and made them thoroughly
comprehensible. They were not studies of persons,
but persons. And yet they were idealized in the sense
that the reader did not think that they were drawn from
the life. They were alive; they were themselves."
The writer might have added that this is proper to all
true masters of fiction who work in the higher regions
of their calling.</p>

<p>Nothing certainly could express better what the new
book was at this time making manifest to its thousands
of readers; not simply an astonishing variety in the
creations of character, but what it was that made these
creations so real; not merely the writer's wealth of
genius, but the secret and form of his art. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
never was any one who had less need to talk about his
characters, because never were characters so surely
revealed by themselves; and it was thus their reality
made itself felt at once. They talked so well that
everybody took to repeating what they said, as the
writer just quoted has pointed out; and the sayings
being the constituent elements of the characters, these
also of themselves became part of the public. This,
which must always be a novelist's highest achievement,
was the art carried to exquisite perfection on a more
limited stage by Miss Austen; and, under widely different
conditions both of art and work, it was pre-eminently
that of Dickens. I told him, on reading the
first dialogue of Mrs. Nickleby and Miss Knag, that
he had been lately reading Miss Bates in <i>Emma</i>, but I
found that he had not at this time made the acquaintance
of that fine writer.</p>

<p>Who that recollects the numbers of <i>Nickleby</i> as they
appeared can have forgotten how each number added
to the general enjoyment? All that had given <i>Pickwick</i>
its vast popularity, the overflowing mirth, hearty exuberance
of humor, and genial kindliness of satire, had
here the advantage of a better-laid design, more connected
incidents, and greater precision of character.
Everybody seemed immediately to know the Nickleby
family as well as his own. Dotheboys, with all that
rendered it, like a piece by Hogarth, both ludicrous
and terrible, became a household word. Successive
groups of Mantalinis, Kenwigses, Crummleses, introduced
each its little world of reality, lighted up everywhere
with truth and life, with capital observation, the
quaintest drollery, and quite boundless mirth and fun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
The brothers Cheeryble brought with them all the
charities. With Smike came the first of those pathetic
pictures that filled the world with pity for what cruelty,
ignorance, or neglect may inflict upon the young. And
Newman Noggs ushered in that class of the creatures
of his fancy in which he took himself perhaps the most
delight, and which the oftener he dealt with the more
he seemed to know how to vary and render attractive:
gentlemen by nature, however shocking bad their hats
or ungenteel their dialects; philosophers of modest endurance,
and needy but most respectable coats; a sort
of humble angels of sympathy and self-denial, though
without a particle of splendor or even good looks about
them, except what an eye as fine as their own feelings
might discern. "My friends," wrote Sydney Smith,
describing to Dickens the anxiety of some ladies of his
acquaintance to meet him at dinner, "have not the
smallest objection to be put into a number, but on the
contrary would be proud of the distinction; and Lady
Charlotte, in particular, you may marry to Newman
Noggs." Lady Charlotte was not a more real person to
Sydney than Newman Noggs; and all the world that
Dickens attracted to his books could draw from them
the same advantage as the man of wit and genius. It
has been lately objected that humanity is not seen in
them in its highest or noblest types, and the assertion
may hereafter be worth considering; but what is very
certain is, that they have inculcated humanity in
familiar and engaging forms to thousands and tens of
thousands of their readers, who can hardly have failed
each to make his little world around him somewhat the
better for their teaching. From first to last they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
never for a moment alien to either the sympathies or
the understandings of any class; and there were crowds
of people at this time that could not have told you
what imagination meant, who were adding month by
month to their limited stores the boundless gains of
imagination.</p>

<p>One other kindliest product of humor in <i>Nickleby</i>,
not to be passed over in even thus briefly recalling a
few first impressions of it, was the good little miniature-painter
Miss La Creevy, living by herself, overflowing
with affections she has nobody to bestow on,
but always cheerful by dint of industry and good-heartedness.
When she is disappointed in the character
of a woman she has been to see, she eases her mind
by saying a very cutting thing at her expense <i>in a soliloquy:</i>
and thereby illustrates one of the advantages of
having lived alone so long, that she made always a confidante
of herself; was as sarcastic as she could be, by
herself, on people who offended her; pleased herself,
and did no harm. Here was one of those touches,
made afterwards familiar to the readers of Dickens by
innumerable similar fancies, which added affection to
their admiration for the writer, and enabled them to
anticipate the feeling with which posterity would regard
him as indeed the worthy companion of the Goldsmiths
and Fieldings. There was a piece of writing,
too, within not many pages of it, of which Leigh Hunt
exclaimed on reading it that it surpassed the best things
of the kind in Smollett that he was able to call to mind.
This was the letter of Miss Squeers to Ralph Nickleby,
giving him her version of the chastisement inflicted by
Nicholas on the schoolmaster: "My pa requests me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to write to you, the doctors considering it doubtful
whether he will ever recuvver the use of his legs which
prevents his holding a pen. We are in a state of mind
beyond everything, and my pa is one mask of brooses
both blue and green likewise two forms are steepled in
his Goar.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Me and my brother were then the victims
of his feury since which we have suffered very
much which leads us to the arrowing belief that we
have received some injury in our insides, especially as
no marks of violence are visible externally. I am
screaming out loud all the time I write and so is my
brother which takes off my attention rather and I hope
will excuse mistakes".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Thus rapidly may be indicated some elements that
contributed to the sudden and astonishingly wide popularity
of these books. I purposely reserve from my
present notices of them, which are biographical rather
than critical, any statement of the reasons for which I
think them inferior in imagination and fancy to some
of the later works; but there was continued and steady
growth in them on the side of humor, observation, and
character, while freshness and raciness of style continued
to be an important help. There are faults of
occasional exaggeration in the writing, but none that
do not spring from animal spirits and good humor, or
a pardonable excess, here and there, on the side of
earnestness; and it has the rare virtue, whether gay or
grave, of being always thoroughly intelligible and for
the most part thoroughly natural, of suiting itself without
effort to every change of mood, as quick, warm,
and comprehensive as the sympathies it is taxed to
express. The tone also is excellent. We are never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
repelled by egotism or conceit, and misplaced ridicule
never disgusts us. When good is going on, we are
sure to see all the beauty of it; and when there is
evil, we are in no danger of mistaking it for good.
No one can paint more picturesquely by an apposite
epithet, or illustrate more happily by a choice allusion.
Whatever he knows or feels, too, is always at his
fingers' ends, and is present through whatever he is
doing. What Rebecca says to Ivanhoe of the black
knight's mode of fighting would not be wholly inapplicable
to Dickens's manner of writing: "There is more
than mere strength, there seems as if the whole soul and
spirit of the champion were given to every blow he
deals." This, when a man deals his blows with a pen,
is the sort of handling that freshens with new life the
oldest facts, and breathes into thoughts the most familiar
an emotion not felt before. There seemed to be not
much to add to our knowledge of London until his
books came upon us, but each in this respect outstripped
the other in its marvels. In <i>Nickleby</i> the old city reappears
under every aspect; and whether warmth and
light are playing over what is good and cheerful in it,
or the veil is uplifted from its darker scenes, it is at all
times our privilege to see and feel it as it absolutely is.
Its interior hidden life becomes familiar as its commonest
outward forms, and we discover that we hardly
knew anything of the places we supposed that we knew
the best.</p>

<p>Of such notices as his letters give of his progress with
<i>Nickleby</i>, which occupied him from February, 1838,
to October, 1839, something may now be said. Soon
after the agreement for it was signed, before the Christmas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of 1837 was over, he went down into Yorkshire
with Mr. Hablot Browne to look up the Cheap Schools
in that county to which public attention had been
painfully drawn by a law-case in the previous year;
which had before been notorious for cruelties committed
in them, whereof he had heard as early as in his childish
days;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and which he was bent upon destroying if
he could. I soon heard the result of his journey; and
the substance of that letter, returned to him for the
purpose, is in his preface to the story written for the
collected edition. He came back confirmed in his design,
and in February set to work upon his first chapter.
On his birthday he wrote to me, "I <i>have</i> begun! I
wrote four slips last night, so you see the beginning is
made. And what is more, I can go on: so I hope the
book is in training at last." "The first chapter of
<i>Nicholas</i> is done," he wrote two days later. "It took
time, but I think answers the purpose as well as it
could." Then, after a dozen days more, "I wrote
twenty slips of <i>Nicholas</i> yesterday, left only four to do
this morning (up at 8 o'clock too!), and have ordered
my horse at one." I joined him as he expected, and
we read together at dinner that day the first number of
<i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>.</p>

<p>In the following number there was a difficulty which
it was marvelous should not oftener have occurred to
him in this form of publication. "I could not write a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
line till three o'clock," he says, describing the close
of that number, "and have yet five slips to finish, and
don't know what to put in them, for I have reached the
point I meant to leave off with." He found easy
remedy for such a miscalculation at his outset, and it
was nearly his last as well as first misadventure of the
kind: his difficulty in <i>Pickwick</i>, as he once told me,
having always been, not the running short, but the
running over: not the whip, but the drag, that was
wanted. Sufflaminandus erat, as Ben Jonson said of
Shakspeare. And in future works, with such marvelous
nicety could he do always what he had planned, strictly
within the space available, that only another similar
instance is remembered by me. The third number introduced
the school; and "I remain dissatisfied until
you have seen and read number three," was his way of
announcing to me his own satisfaction with that first
handling of Dotheboys Hall. Nor had it the least
part in my admiration of his powers at this time that
he never wrote without the printer at his heels; that,
always in his later works two or three numbers in
advance, he was never a single number in advance with
this story; that the more urgent the call upon him the
more readily he rose to it; and that his astonishing
animal spirits never failed him. As late in the November
month of 1838 as the 20th, he thus wrote to me:
"I have just begun my second chapter; cannot go out
to-night; must get on; think there <i>will</i> be a <i>Nickleby</i>
at the end of this month now (I doubted it before);
and want to make a start towards it if I possibly can."
That was on Tuesday; and on Friday morning in the
same week, explaining to me the failure of something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
that had been promised the previous day, he tells me,
"I was writing incessantly until it was time to dress;
and have not yet got the subject of my last chapter,
which <i>must be</i> finished to-night."</p>

<p>But this was not all. Between that Tuesday and
Friday an indecent assault had been committed on his
book by a theatrical adapter named Stirling, who seized
upon it without leave while yet only a third of it was
written; hacked, cut, and garbled its dialogue to the
shape of one or two farcical actors; invented for it a plot
and an ending of his own, and produced it at the Adelphi;
where the outraged author, hard pressed as he was
with an unfinished number, had seen it in the interval
between the two letters I have quoted. He would not
have run such a risk in later years, but he threw off
lightly at present even such offenses to his art; and
though I was with him at a representation of his <i>Oliver
Twist</i> the following month at the Surrey theatre, when
in the middle of the first scene he laid himself down
upon the floor in a corner of the box and never rose
from it until the drop-scene fell, he had been able
to sit through <i>Nickleby</i> and to see a kind of merit
in some of the actors. Mr. Yates had a sufficiently
humorous meaning in his wildest extravagance, and
Mr. O. Smith could put into his queer angular oddities
enough of a hard dry pathos, to conjure up shadows
at least of Mantalini and Newman Noggs; of Ralph
Nickleby there was indeed nothing visible save a wig,
a spencer, and a pair of boots; but there was a quaint
actor named Wilkinson who proved equal to the drollery
though not to the fierce brutality of Squeers; and
even Dickens, in the letter that amazed me by telling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
me of his visit to the theatre, was able to praise
"the skillful management and dressing of the boys,
the capital manner and speech of Fanny Squeers, the
dramatic representation of her card-party in Squeers's
parlor, the careful making-up of all the people, and
the exceedingly good tableaux formed from Browne's
sketches.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mrs. Keeley's first appearance beside
the fire (see wollum), and all the rest of Smike, was excellent;
bating sundry choice sentiments and rubbish
regarding the little robins in the fields which have been
put in the boy's mouth by Mr. Stirling the adapter."
His toleration could hardly be extended to the robins,
and their author he very properly punished by introducing
and denouncing him at Mr. Crummles's farewell
supper.</p>

<p>The story was well in hand at the next letter to be
quoted, for I limit myself to those only with allusions
that are characteristic or illustrative. "I must be alone
in my glory to-day," he wrote, "and see what I can
do. I perpetrated a great amount of work yesterday,
and have every day indeed since Monday, but I must
buckle-to again and endeavor to get the steam up. If
this were to go on long, I should 'bust' the boiler. I
think Mrs. Nickleby's love-scene will come out rather
unique." The steam doubtless rose dangerously
high when such happy inspiration came. It was but
a few numbers earlier than this, while that eccentric
lady was imparting her confidences to Miss Knag, that
Sydney Smith confessed himself vanquished by a humor
against which his own had long striven to hold out.
"<i>Nickleby</i> is <i>very good</i>," he wrote to Sir George Phillips
after the sixth number. "I stood out against Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Dickens as long as I could, but he has conquered
me."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The close of the story was written at Broadstairs,
from which (he had taken a house "two doors from
the Albion Hotel, where we had that merry night two
years ago") he wrote to me on the 9th September,
1839, "I am hard at it, but these windings-up wind
slowly, and I shall think I have done great things if I
have entirely finished by the 20th. Chapman &amp; Hall
came down yesterday with Browne's sketches, and
dined here. They imparted their intentions as to a
Nicklebeian f&ecirc;te which will make you laugh heartily&mdash;so
I reserve them till you come. It has been blowing
great guns for the last three days, and last night (I
wish you could have seen it!) there was such a sea!
I staggered down to the pier, and, creeping under the
lee of a large boat which was high and dry, watched it
breaking for nearly an hour. Of course I came back
wet through." On the afternoon of Wednesday, the
18th, he wrote again: "I shall not finish entirely before
Friday, sending Hicks the last twenty pages of manuscript
by the night-coach. I have had pretty stiff work,
as you may suppose, and I have taken great pains. The
discovery is made, Ralph is dead, the loves have come
all right, Tim Linkinwater has proposed, and I have
now only to break up Dotheboys and the book together.
I am very anxious that you should see this
conclusion before it leaves my hands, and I plainly see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
therefore that I must come to town myself on Saturday
if I would not endanger the appearance of the
number. So I have written to Hicks to send proofs to
your chambers as soon as he can that evening; and, if
you don't object, I will dine with you any time after
five, and we will devote the night to a careful reading.
I have not written to Macready, for they have not yet
sent me the title-page of dedication, which is merely
'To W. C. Macready, Esq., the following pages are
inscribed, as a slight token of admiration and regard,
by his friend the Author.' Meanwhile will you let
him know that I have fixed the Nickleby dinner for
Saturday, the 5th of October? Place, the Albion in
Aldersgate Street. Time, six for half-past exactly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I shall be more glad than I can tell you to
see you again, and I look forward to Saturday, and the
evenings that are to follow it, with most joyful anticipation.
I have had a good notion for <i>Barnaby</i>, of
which more anon."</p>

<p>The shadow from the old quarter, we see, the unwritten
<i>Barnaby</i> tale, intrudes itself still; though hardly,
as of old, making other pleasanter anticipations less
joyful. Such, indeed, at this time was his buoyancy
of spirit that it cost him little, compared with the suffering
it gave him at all subsequent similar times, to
separate from the people who for twenty months had
been a part of himself. The increased success they had
achieved left no present room but for gladness and well-won
pride; and so, to welcome them into the immortal
family of the English novel, and open cheerily to their
author "fresh woods and pastures new," we had the dinner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
celebration. But there is small need now to speak
of what has left, to one of the few survivors, only the
sadness of remembering that all who made the happiness
of it are passed away. There was Talfourd, facile
and fluent of kindliest speech, with whom we were in
constant and cordial intercourse, and to whom, grateful
for his copyright exertions in the House of Commons,
he had dedicated <i>Pickwick;</i> there was Maclise,
dear and familiar friend to us both, whose lately-painted
portrait of Dickens hung in the room;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and there was
the painter of the Rent-day, who made a speech as good
as his pictures, rich in color and quaint with homely
allusion, all about the reality of Dickens's genius, and
how there had been nothing like him issuing his novels
part by part since Richardson issued his novels volume
by volume, and how in both cases people talked about
the characters as if they were next-door neighbors or
friends; and as many letters were written to the author
of <i>Nickleby</i> to implore him not to kill poor Smike, as
had been sent by young ladies to the author of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> <i>Clarissa</i>
to "save Lovelace's soul alive." These and others are
gone. Of those who survive, only three arise to my
memory,&mdash;Macready, who spoke his sense of the honor
done him by the dedication in English as good as his
delivery of it, Mr. Edward Chapman, and Mr. Thomas
Beard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name of his old gallery-companion may carry
me back from the days to which the close of <i>Nickleby</i>
had led me to those when it was only beginning.
"This snow will take away the cold weather," he had
written, in that birthday letter of 1838 already quoted,
"and then for Twickenham." Here a cottage was
taken, nearly all the summer was passed, and a familiar
face there was Mr. Beard's. There, with Talfourd and
with Thackeray and Jerrold, we had many friendly days,
too; and the social charm of Maclise was seldom wanting.
Nor was there anything that exercised a greater
fascination over Dickens than the grand enjoyment of
idleness, the ready self-abandonment to the luxury of
laziness, which we both so laughed at in Maclise, under
whose easy swing of indifference, always the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
amusing at the most aggravating events and times, we
knew that there was artist-work as eager, energy as
unwearying, and observation almost as penetrating as
Dickens's own. A greater enjoyment than the fellowship
of Maclise at this period it would indeed be difficult
to imagine. Dickens hardly saw more than he
did, while yet he seemed to be seeing nothing; and
the small esteem in which this rare faculty was held by
himself, a quaint oddity that gave to shrewdness itself
in him an air of Irish simplicity, his unquestionable
turn for literature, and a varied knowledge of it not
always connected with such intense love and such unwearied
practice of one special and absorbing art,
combined to render him attractive far beyond the
common. His fine genius and his handsome person,
of neither of which at any time he seemed himself to
be in the slightest degree conscious, completed the
charm. Edwin Landseer, all the world's favorite, and
the excellent Stanfield, came a few months later, in the
Devonshire-Terrace days; but another painter-friend
was George Cattermole, who had then enough and to
spare of fun as well as fancy to supply ordinary artists
and humorists by the dozen, and wanted only a little
more ballast and steadiness to have had all that could
give attraction to good-fellowship. A friend now especially
welcome, too, was the novelist Mr. Ainsworth,
who shared with us incessantly for the three following
years in the companionship which began at his house;
with whom we visited, during two of those years,
friends of art and letters in his native Manchester,
from among whom Dickens brought away his Brothers
Cheeryble, and to whose sympathy in tastes and pursuits,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
accomplishments in literature, open-hearted generous
ways, and cordial hospitality, many of the
pleasures of later years were due. Frederick Dickens,
to whom soon after this a treasury clerkship was handsomely
given, on Dickens's application, by Mr. Stanley
of Alderley, known in and before those Manchester
days, was for the present again living with his father,
but passed much time in his brother's home; and
another familiar face was that of Mr. Thomas Mitton,
who had known him when himself a law-clerk in Lincoln's
Inn, through whom there was introduction of
the relatives of a friend and partner, Mr. Smithson, the
gentleman connected with Yorkshire mentioned in his
preface to <i>Nickleby</i>, who became very intimate in his
house. These, his father and mother and their two
younger sons, with members of his wife's family, and
his married sisters and their husbands, Mr. and Mrs.
Burnett and Mr. and Mrs. Austin, are figures that all
associate themselves prominently with the days of
Doughty Street and the cottages of Twickenham and
Petersham as remembered by me in the summers of
1838 and 1839.</p>

<p>In the former of these years the sports were necessarily
quieter<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> than at Petersham, where extensive garden-grounds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
admitted of much athletic competition, from
the more difficult forms of which I in general modestly
retired, but where Dickens for the most part held his
own against even such accomplished athletes as Maclise
and Mr. Beard. Bar-leaping, bowling, and quoits were
among the games carried on with the greatest ardor;
and in sustained energy, what is called keeping it up,
Dickens certainly distanced every competitor. Even
the lighter recreations of battledoor and bagatelle were
pursued with relentless activity; and at such amusements
as the Petersham races, in those days rather celebrated,
and which he visited daily while they lasted,
he worked much harder himself than the running
horses did.</p>

<p>What else his letters of these years enable me to recall,
that could possess any interest now, may be told
in a dozen sentences. He wrote a farce by way of
helping the Covent Garden manager which the actors
could not agree about, and which he turned afterwards
into a story called <i>The Lamplighter</i>. He entered his
name among the students at the inn of the Middle
Temple, though he did not eat dinners there until
many years later. We made together a circuit of
nearly all the London prisons, and, in coming to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
prisoners under remand while going over Newgate, accompanied
by Macready and Mr. Hablot Browne,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
were startled by a sudden tragic cry of "My God!
there's Wainewright!" In the shabby-genteel creature,
with sandy disordered hair and dirty moustache, who
had turned quickly round with a defiant stare at our
entrance, looking at once mean and fierce, and quite
capable of the cowardly murders he had committed, Macready
had been horrified to recognize a man familiarly
known to him in former years, and at whose table he
had dined. Between the completion of <i>Oliver</i> and its
publication, Dickens went to see something of North
Wales; and, joining him at Liverpool, I returned with
him.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Soon after his arrival he had pleasant communication
with Lockhart, dining with him at Cruikshank's
a little later; and this was the prelude to a
<i>Quarterly</i> notice of <i>Oliver</i> by Mr. Ford, written at the
instance of Lockhart, but without the raciness he would
have put into it, in which amende was made for previous
less favorable remarks in that review. Dickens had
not, however, waited for this to express publicly his
hearty sympathy with Lockhart's handling of some
passages in his admirable <i>Life of Scott</i> that had drawn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
down upon him the wrath of the Ballantynes. This he
did in the <i>Examiner;</i> where also I find him noticing a
book by Thomas Hood: "rather poor, but I have not
said so, because Hood is too, and ill besides." In the
course of the year he was taken into Devonshire to
select a home for his father, on the removal of the latter
(who had long given up his reporting duties) from
his London residence; and this he found in a cottage
at Alphington, near Exeter, where he placed the elder
Dickens with his wife and their youngest son. The
same year closed Macready's Covent Garden management,
and at the dinner to the retiring manager, when
the Duke of Cambridge took the chair, Dickens spoke
with that wonderful instinct of knowing what to abstain
from saying, as well as what to say, which made his
after-dinner speeches quite unique. Nor should mention
be omitted of the Shakspeare Society, now diligently
attended, of which Procter, Talfourd, Macready,
Thackeray, Henry Davison, Blanchard, Charles Knight,
John Bell, Douglas Jerrold, Maclise, Stanfield, George
Cattermole, the good Tom Landseer, Frank Stone, and
other old friends were members, and where, out of
much enjoyment and many disputings,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> there arose,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
from Dickens and all of us, plenty of after-dinner oratory.
The closing months of this year of 1839 had
special interest for him. At the end of October another
daughter was born to him, who bears the name of that
dear friend of his and mine, Macready, whom he asked
to be her godfather; and before the close of the year
he had moved out of Doughty Street into Devonshire
Terrace, a handsome house with a garden of considerable
size, shut out from the New Road by a high brick
wall facing the York Gate into Regent's Park. These
various matters, and his attempts at the <i>Barnaby</i> novel
on the conclusion of <i>Nickleby</i>, are the subject of his
letters between October and December.</p>

<p>"Thank God, all goes famously. I have worked at
<i>Barnaby</i> all day, and moreover seen a beautiful (and
reasonable) house in Kent Terrace, where Macready
once lived, but larger than his." Again (this having
gone off): "<i>Barnaby</i> has suffered so much from the
house-hunting, that I mustn't chop to-day." Then
(for the matter of the Middle Temple), "I return the
form. It's the right temple, I take for granted. <i>Barnaby</i>
moves, not at race-horse speed, but yet as fast (I
think) as under these unsettled circumstances could
possibly be expected." Or again: "All well. <i>Barnaby</i>
has reached his tenth page. I have just turned
lazy, and have passed into <i>Christabel</i>, and thence to
<i>Wallenstein</i>." At last the choice was made. "A
house of great promise (and great premium), 'undeniable'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
situation, and excessive splendor, is in view.
Mitton is in treaty, and I am in ecstatic restlessness.
Kate wants to know whether you have any books to
send her, so please to shoot here any literary rubbish
on hand." To these I will only add a couple of extracts
from his letters while in Exeter arranging his
father's and mother's new home. They are very
humorous; and the vividness with which everything,
once seen, was photographed in his mind and memory,
is pleasantly shown in them.</p>

<p>"I took a little house for them this morning" (5th
March, 1839: from the New London Inn), "and if
they are not pleased with it I shall be grievously disappointed.
Exactly a mile beyond the city on the
Plymouth road there are two white cottages: one is
theirs and the other belongs to their landlady. I
almost forget the number of rooms, but there is an excellent
parlor with two other rooms on the ground floor,
there is really a beautiful little room over the parlor
which I am furnishing as a drawing-room, and there is
a splendid garden. The paint and paper throughout is
new and fresh and cheerful-looking, the place is clean
beyond all description, and the neighborhood I suppose
the most beautiful in this most beautiful of English
counties. Of the landlady, a Devonshire widow
with whom I had the honor of taking lunch to-day, I
must make most especial mention. She is a fat, infirm,
splendidly-fresh-faced country dame, rising sixty and
recovering from an attack 'on the nerves'&mdash;I thought
they never went off the stones, but I find they
try country air with the best of us. In the event of
my mother's being ill at any time, I really think the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
vicinity of this good dame, the very picture of respectability
and good humor, will be the greatest possible
comfort. <i>Her</i> furniture and domestic arrangements
are a capital picture, but that I reserve till I see you,
when I anticipate a hearty laugh. She bears the highest
character with the bankers and the clergyman (who
formerly lived in <i>my</i> cottage himself), and is a kind-hearted
worthy capital specimen of the sort of life,
or I have no eye for the real and no idea of finding it
out.</p>

<p>"This good lady's brother and his wife live in the
next nearest cottage, and the brother transacts the good
lady's business, the nerves not admitting of her transacting
it herself, although they leave her in her debilitated
state something sharper than the finest lancet.
Now, the brother having coughed all night till he
coughed himself into such a perspiration that you
might have 'wringed his hair,' according to the asseveration
of eye-witnesses, his wife was sent for to negotiate
with me; and if you could have seen me sitting in
the kitchen with the two old women, endeavoring to
make them comprehend that I had no evil intentions
or covert designs, and that I had come down all that
way to take some cottage and had <i>happened</i> to walk
down that road and see that particular one, you would
never have forgotten it. Then, to see the servant-girl
run backwards and forwards to the sick man, and when
the sick man had signed one agreement which I drew
up and the old woman instantly put away in a disused
tea-caddy, to see the trouble and the number of messages
it took before the sick man could be brought to
sign another (a duplicate) that we might have one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
apiece, was one of the richest scraps of genuine drollery
I ever saw in all my days. How, when the business
was over, we became conversational; how I was facetious,
and at the same time virtuous and domestic; how
I drank toasts in the beer, and stated on interrogatory
that I was a married man and the father of two blessed
infants; how the ladies marveled thereat; how one
of the ladies, having been in London, inquired where
I lived, and, being told, remembered that Doughty
Street and the Foundling Hospital were in the Old
Kent Road, which I didn't contradict,&mdash;all this and a
great deal more must make us laugh when I return, as it
makes me laugh now to think of. Of my subsequent
visit to the upholsterer recommended by the landlady;
of the absence of the upholsterer's wife, and the timidity
of the upholsterer fearful of acting in her absence; of my
sitting behind a high desk in a little dark shop, calling
over the articles in requisition and checking off the
prices as the upholsterer exhibited the goods and called
them out; of my coming over the upholsterer's daughter
with many virtuous endearments, to propitiate the
establishment and reduce the bill; of these matters I
say nothing, either, for the same reason as that just
mentioned. The discovery of the cottage I seriously
regard as a blessing (not to speak it profanely) upon
our efforts in this cause. I had heard nothing from the
bank, and walked straight there, by some strange impulse,
directly after breakfast. I am sure they may be
happy there; for if I were older, and my course of
activity were run, I am sure <i>I</i> could, with God's blessing,
for many and many a year."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"The theatre is open here, and Charles Kean is to-night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
playing for his last night. If it had been the
'rig'lar' drama I should have gone, but I was afraid Sir
Giles Overreach might upset me, so I stayed away. My
quarters are excellent, and the head-waiter is <i>such</i> a
waiter! Knowles (not Sheridan Knowles, but Knowles
of the Cheetham Hill Road<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>) is an ass to him. This
sounds bold, but truth is stranger than fiction. By-the-by,
not the least comical thing that has occurred was the
visit of the upholsterer (with some further calculations)
since I began this letter. I think they took me here at
the New London for the Wonderful Being I am; they
were amazingly sedulous; and no doubt they looked
for my being visited by the nobility and gentry of the
neighborhood. My first and only visitor came to-night:
a ruddy-faced man in faded black, with extracts from a
feather-bed all over him; an extraordinary and quite
miraculously dirty face; a thick stick; and the personal
appearance altogether of an amiable bailiff in a green
old age. I have not seen the proper waiter since, and
more than suspect I shall not recover this blow. He
was announced (by <i>the</i> waiter) as 'a person.' I expect
my bill every minute.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"The waiter is laughing outside the door with
another waiter&mdash;this is the latest intelligence of my
condition."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> time was now come for him seriously to busy
himself with a successor to <i>Pickwick</i> and <i>Nickleby</i>,
which he had not, however, waited thus long before
turning over thoroughly in his mind. <i>Nickleby's</i> success
had so far outgone even the expectation raised by
<i>Pickwick's</i>, that, without some handsome practical admission
of this fact at the close, its publishers could
hardly hope to retain him. This had been frequently
discussed by us, and was well understood. But, apart
from the question of his resuming with them at all, he
had persuaded himself it might be unsafe to resume in
the old way, believing the public likely to tire of the
same twenty numbers over again. There was also
another and more sufficient reason for change which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
naturally had great weight with him, and this was the
hope that, by invention of a new mode as well as kind
of serial publication, he might be able for a time to
discontinue the writing of a long story with all its
strain on his fancy, in any case to shorten and vary
the length of the stories written by himself, and perhaps
ultimately to retain all the profits of a continuous
publication without necessarily himself contributing
every line that was to be written for it. These considerations
had been discussed still more anxiously;
and for several months some such project had been taking
form in his thoughts.</p>

<p>While he was at Petersham (July, 1839) he thus wrote
to me: "I have been thinking that subject over. Indeed,
I have been doing so to the great stoppage of
<i>Nickleby</i> and the great worrying and fidgeting of myself.
I have been thinking that if Chapman &amp; Hall
were to admit you into their confidence with respect to
what they mean to do at the conclusion of <i>Nickleby</i>,
without admitting me, it would help us very much.
You know that I am well disposed towards them, and
that if they do something handsome, even handsomer
perhaps than they dreamt of doing, they will find it
their interest, and will find me tractable. You know
also that I have had straightforward offers from responsible
men to publish anything for me at a percentage
on the profits and take all the risk; but that I am unwilling
to leave them, and have declared to you that if
they behave with liberality to me I will not on any
consideration, although to a certain extent I certainly
and surely must gain by it. Knowing all this, I feel
sure that if you were to put before them the glories of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
our new project, and, reminding them that when <i>Barnaby</i>
is published I am clear of all engagements, were
to tell them that if they wish to secure me and perpetuate
our connection now is the time for them to step
gallantly forward and make such proposals as will produce
that result,&mdash;I feel quite sure that if this should be
done by you, as you only can do it, the result will be
of the most vital importance to me and mine, and that
a very great deal may be effected, thus, to recompense
your friend for very small profits and very large work
as yet. I shall see you, please God, on Tuesday night;
and if they wait upon you on Wednesday, I shall remain
in town until that evening."</p>

<p>They came; and the tenor of the interview was so
favorable that I wished him to put in writing what from
time to time had been discussed in connection with
the new project. This led to the very interesting letter
I shall now quote, written also in the same month from
Petersham. I did not remember, until I lately read it,
that the notion of a possible visit to America had been
in his thoughts so early.</p>

<p>"I should be willing to commence on the thirty-first
of March, 1840, a new publication, consisting entirely
of original matter, of which one number, price threepence,
should be published every week, and of which a
certain amount of numbers should form a volume, to
be published at regular intervals. The best general
idea of the plan of the work might be given, perhaps,
by reference to the <i>Spectator</i>, the <i>Tatler</i>, and Goldsmith's
<i>Bee;</i> but it would be far more popular both in
the subjects of which it treats and its mode of treating
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should propose to start, as the <i>Spectator</i> does, with
some pleasant fiction relative to the origin of the publication;
to introduce a little club or knot of characters
and to carry their personal histories and proceedings
through the work; to introduce fresh characters constantly;
to reintroduce Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller,
the latter of whom might furnish an occasional communication
with great effect; to write amusing essays on
the various foibles of the day as they arise; to take advantage
of all passing events; and to vary the form of
the papers by throwing them into sketches, essays,
tales, adventures, letters from imaginary correspondents,
and so forth, so as to diversify the contents as
much as possible.</p>

<p>"In addition to this general description of the contents,
I may add that under particular heads I should
strive to establish certain features in the work, which
should be so many veins of interest and amusement
running through the whole. Thus the Chapters on
Chambers, which I have long thought and spoken of,
might be very well incorporated with it; and a series
of papers has occurred to me containing stories and
descriptions of London as it was many years ago, as
it is now, and as it will be many years hence, to which
I would give some such title as The Relaxations of Gog
and Magog, dividing them into portions like the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>, and supposing Gog and Magog to
entertain each other with such narrations in Guildhall
all night long, and to break off every morning at daylight.
An almost inexhaustible field of fun, raillery,
and interest would be laid open by pursuing this idea.</p>

<p>"I would also commence, and continue from time to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
time, a series of satirical papers purporting to be translated
from some Savage Chronicles, and to describe the
administration of justice in some country that never
existed, and record the proceedings of its wise men.
The object of this series (which if I can compare it
with anything would be something between <i>Gulliver's
Travels</i> and the <i>Citizen of the World</i>) would be to keep
a special lookout upon the magistrates in town and
country, and never to leave those worthies alone.</p>

<p>"The quantity of each number that should be written
by myself would be a matter for discussion and arrangement.
Of course I should pledge and bind myself upon
that head. Nobody but myself would ever pursue <i>these
ideas</i>, but I must have assistance of course, and there
must be some contents of a different kind. Their general
nature might be agreed upon beforehand, but I
should stipulate that this assistance is chosen solely by
myself, and that the contents of every number are as
much under my own control, and subject to as little
interference, as those of a number of <i>Pickwick</i> or
<i>Nickleby</i>.</p>

<p>"In order to give fresh novelty and interest to this
undertaking, I should be ready to contract to go at
any specified time (say in the midsummer or autumn
of the year, when a sufficient quantity of matter in advance
should have been prepared, or earlier if it were
thought fit) either to Ireland or to America, and to
write from thence a series of papers descriptive of the
places and people I see, introducing local tales, traditions,
and legends, something after the plan of Washington
Irving's <i>Alhambra</i>. I should wish the republication
of these papers in a separate form, with others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
to render the subject complete (if we should deem it
advisable), to form part of the arrangement for the
work; and I should wish the same provision to be
made for the republication of the Gog and Magog
series, or indeed any that I undertook.</p>

<p>"This is a very rough and slight outline of the project
I have in view. I am ready to talk the matter
over, to give any further explanations, to consider any
suggestions, or to go into the details of the subject immediately.
I say nothing of the novelty of such a publication
nowadays, or its chances of success. Of course
I think them very great, very great indeed,&mdash;almost
beyond calculation,&mdash;or I should not seek to bind myself
to anything so extensive.</p>

<p>"The heads of the terms upon which I should be
prepared to go into this undertaking would be&mdash;That I
be made a proprietor in the work and a sharer in the
profits. That when I bind myself to write a certain
portion of every number, I am insured, <i>for</i> that writing
in every number, a certain sum of money. That those
who assist me, and contribute the remainder of every
number, shall be paid by the publishers immediately
after its appearance, according to a scale to be calculated
and agreed upon, on presenting my order for the
amount to which they may be respectively entitled. Or,
if the publishers prefer it, that they agree to pay me a
certain sum for the <i>whole</i> of every number, and leave
me to make such arrangements for that part which I
may not write, as I think best. Of course I should require
that for these payments, or any other outlay connected
with the work, I am not held accountable in any
way; and that no portion of them is to be considered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
as received by me on account of the profits. I need
not add that some arrangement would have to be made,
if I undertake my Travels, relative to the expenses of
traveling.</p>

<p>"Now, I want our publishing friends to take these
things into consideration, and to give me the views and
proposals they would be disposed to entertain when they
have maturely considered the matter."</p>

<p>The result of their consideration was, on the whole,
satisfactory. An additional fifteen hundred pounds was
to be paid at the close of <i>Nickleby</i>, the new adventure
was to be undertaken, and Cattermole was to be joined
with Browne as its illustrator. Nor was its plan much
modified before starting, though it was felt by us all
that, for the opening numbers at least, Dickens would
have to be sole contributor, and that, whatever otherwise
might be its attraction, or the success of the detached
papers proposed by him, some reinforcement of
them from time to time, by means of a story with his
name continued at reasonable if not regular intervals,
would be found absolutely necessary. Without any
such planned story, however, the work did actually begin,
its course afterwards being determined by circumstances
stronger than any project he had formed. The
agreement, drawn up in contemplation of a mere miscellany
of detached papers or essays, and in which no
mention of any story appeared, was signed at the end
of March; and its terms were such as to place him in
his only proper and legitimate position in regard to all
such contracts, of being necessarily a gainer in any
case, and, in the event of success, the greatest gainer
of all concerned in the undertaking. All the risk of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
every kind was to be undergone by the publishers; and,
as part of the expenses to be defrayed by them of each
weekly number, he was to receive fifty pounds. Whatever
the success or failure, this was always to be paid.
The numbers were then to be accounted for separately,
and half the realized profits paid to him, the other half
going to the publishers; each number being held
strictly responsible for itself, and the loss upon it, supposing
any, not carried to the general account. The
work was to be continued for twelve months certain,
with leave to the publishers then to close it; but if
they elected to go on, he was himself bound to the enterprise
for five years, and the ultimate copyright as
well as profit was to be equally divided.</p>

<p>Six weeks before signature of this agreement, while a
title was still undetermined, I had this letter from him:
"I will dine with you. I intended to spend the evening
in strict meditation (as I did last night); but perhaps
I had better go out, lest all work and no play
should make me a dull boy. <i>I</i> have a list of titles too,
but the final title I have determined on&mdash;or something
very near it. I have a notion of this old file in the
queer house, opening the book by an account of himself,
and, among other peculiarities, of his affection for
an old quaint queer-cased clock; showing how that
when they have sat alone together in the long evenings,
he has got accustomed to its voice, and come to consider
it as the voice of a friend; how its striking, in
the night, has seemed like an assurance to him that it
was still, a cheerful watcher at his chamber-door; and
now its very face has seemed to have something of
welcome in its dusty features, and to relax from its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
grimness when he has looked at it from his chimney-corner.
Then I mean to tell how that he has kept odd
manuscripts in the old, deep, dark, silent closet where
the weights are; and taken them from thence to read
(mixing up his enjoyments with some notion of his
clock); and how, when the club came to be formed,
they, by reason of their punctuality and his regard for
this dumb servant, took their name from it. And thus
I shall call the book either <i>Old Humphrey's Clock</i>, or
<i>Master Humphrey's Clock;</i> beginning with a woodcut
of old Humphrey and his clock, and explaining the
why and wherefore. All Humphrey's own papers will
be dated then From my clock-side, and I have divers
thoughts about the best means of introducing the others.
I thought about this all day yesterday and all last night
till I went to bed. I am sure I can make a good thing
of this opening, which I have thoroughly warmed up
to in consequence."</p>

<p>A few days later: "I incline rather more to <i>Master
Humphrey's Clock</i> than <i>Old Humphrey's</i>&mdash;if so be that
there is no danger of the pensive confounding master
with a boy." After two days more: "I was thinking
all yesterday, and have begun at <i>Master Humphrey</i> to-day."
Then, a week later: "I have finished the first
number, but have not been able to do more in the
space than lead up to the Giants, who are just on the
scene."</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">day</span> or two after the date of the last letter quoted,
Dickens and his wife, with Maclise and myself, visited
Landor in Bath, and it was during three happy days we
passed together there that the fancy which was shortly
to take the form of Little Nell first occurred to its author,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>&mdash;but
as yet with the intention only of making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
out of it a tale of a few chapters. On the 1st of March
we returned from Bath; and on the 4th I had this letter:
"If you can manage to give me a call in the course
of the day or evening, I wish you would. I am laboriously
turning over in my mind how I can best effect the
improvement we spoke of last night, which I will certainly
make by hook or by crook, and which I would
like you to see <i>before</i> it goes finally to the printer's. I
have determined not to put that witch-story into number
3, for I am by no means satisfied of the effect of its
contrast with Humphrey. I think of lengthening Humphrey,
finishing the description of the society, and
closing with the little child-story, which is <span class="smcap">sure</span> to be
effective, especially after the old man's quiet way."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Then there came hard upon this: "What do you think
of the following double title for the beginning of that
little tale? '<span class="smcap">Personal Adventures of Master Humphrey</span>:
<i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>.' I have thought of
<i>Master Humphrey's Tale</i>, <i>Master Humphrey's Narrative</i>,
<i>A Passage in Master Humphrey's Life</i>&mdash;but I don't
think any does as well as this. I have also thought of
<i>The Old Curiosity Dealer and the Child</i> instead of <i>The
Old Curiosity Shop</i>. Perpend. Topping waits."&mdash;&mdash;And
thus was taking gradual form, with less direct consciousness
of design on his own part than I can remember
in any other instance of all his career, a story which
was to add largely to his popularity, more than any
other of his works to make the bond between himself
and his readers one of personal attachment, and very
widely to increase the sense entertained of his powers
as a pathetic as well as humorous writer.</p>

<p>He had not written more than two or three chapters,
when the capability of the subject for more extended
treatment than he had at first proposed to give to it
pressed itself upon him, and he resolved to throw everything
else aside, devoting himself to the one story only.
There were other strong reasons for this. Of the first
number of the <i>Clock</i> nearly seventy thousand were sold;
but with the discovery that there was no continuous
tale the orders at once diminished, and a change must
have been made even if the material and means for it
had not been ready. There had been an interval of
three numbers between the first and second chapters,
which the society of Mr. Pickwick and the two Wellers
made pleasant enough; but after the introduction of
Dick Swiveller there were three consecutive chapters;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and in the continued progress of the tale to its close
there were only two more breaks, one between the
fourth and fifth chapters and one between the eighth
and ninth, pardonable and enjoyable now for the sake
of Sam and his father. The reintroduction of these
old favorites, it will have been seen, formed part of his
original plan; of his abandonment of which his own
description may be added, from his preface to the
collected edition: "The first chapter of this tale appeared
in the fourth number of <i>Master Humphrey's
Clock</i>, when I had already been made uneasy by the
desultory character of that work, and when, I believe,
my readers had thoroughly participated in the feeling.
The commencement of a story was a great satisfaction
to me, and I had reason to believe that my readers
participated in this feeling too. Hence, being pledged
to some interruptions and some pursuit of the original
design, I set cheerfully about disentangling myself from
those impediments as fast as I could; and, this done,
from that time until its completion <i>The Old Curiosity
Shop</i> was written and published from week to week, in
weekly parts."</p>

<p>He had very early himself become greatly taken with
it. "I am very glad indeed," he wrote to me after
the first half-dozen chapters, "that you think so well
of the <i>Curiosity Shop</i>, and especially that what may be
got out of Dick strikes you. I <i>mean</i> to make much of
him. I feel the story extremely myself, which I take
to be a good sign; and am already warmly interested
in it. I shall run it on now for four whole numbers
together, to give it a fair chance." Every step lightened
the road as it became more and more real with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
each character that appeared in it, and I still recall the
glee with which he told me what he intended to do not
only with Dick Swiveller, but with Septimus Brass,
changed afterwards to Sampson. Undoubtedly, however,
Dick was his favorite. "Dick's behavior in the
matter of Miss Wackles will, I hope, give you satisfaction,"
is the remark of another of his letters. "I cannot
yet discover that his aunt has any belief in him, or
is in the least degree likely to send him a remittance,
so that he will probably continue to be the sport of
destiny." His difficulties were the quickly recurring
times of publication, the confined space in each number
that yet had to contribute its individual effect, and
(from the suddenness with which he had begun) the
impossibility of getting in advance. "I was obliged
to cramp most dreadfully what I thought a pretty idea
in the last chapter. I hadn't room to turn:" to this
or a similar effect his complaints are frequent, and of
the vexations named it was by far the worst. But he
steadily bore up against all, and made a triumph of the
little story.</p>

<p>To help his work he went twice to Broadstairs, in
June and in September. From this he wrote to me
(17th June), "It's now four o'clock, and I have been
at work since half-past eight. I have really dried myself
up into a condition which would almost justify me
in pitching off the cliff, head first&mdash;but I must get
richer before I indulge in a crowning luxury. Number
15, which I began to-day, I anticipate great things
from. There is a description of getting gradually out
of town, and passing through neighborhoods of distinct
and various characters, with which, if I had read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
it as anybody else's writing, I think I should have been
very much struck. The child and the old man are on
their journey of course, and the subject is a very pretty
one." Between these two Broadstairs visits he wrote
to me, "I intended calling on you this morning on my
way back from Bevis Marks, whither I went to look at
a house for Sampson Brass. But I got mingled up in a
kind of social paste with the Jews of Houndsditch, and
roamed about among them till I came out in Moorfields,
quite unexpectedly. So I got into a cab, and
came home again, very tired, by way of the City Road."
At the opening of September he was again at Broadstairs.
The residence he most desired there, Fort
House, stood prominently at the top of a breezy hill
on the road to Kingsgate, with a corn-field between it
and the sea, and this in many subsequent years he
always occupied; but he was fain to be content, as
yet, with Lawn House, a smaller villa between the hill
and the corn-field, from which he now wrote of his attentions
to Mr. Sampson Brass's sister: "I have been
at work of course" (2d September), "and have just
finished a number. I have effected a reform by virtue
of which we breakfast at a quarter-before eight, so that
I get to work at half-past, and am commonly free by
one o'clock or so, which is a great happiness. Dick
is now Sampson's clerk, and I have touched Miss
Brass in Number 25, lightly, but effectively I hope."</p>

<p>At this point it became necessary to close the first
volume of the <i>Clock</i>, which was issued accordingly with
a dedication to Rogers, and a preface to which allusion
will be made hereafter. "I have opened the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
volume," he wrote to me on the 9th of September,
"with Kit; and I saw this morning looking out at the
sea, as if a veil had been lifted up, an affecting thing
that I can do with him by-and-by. Nous verrons."
"I am glad you like that Kit number," he wrote twelve
days later; "I thought you would. I have altered that
about the opera-going. Of course I had no intention
to delude the many-headed into a false belief concerning
opera-nights, but merely to specify a class of senators.
I needn't have done it, however, for God knows
they're pretty well all alike." This referred to an
objection made by me to something he had written
of "opera-going senators on Wednesday nights;" and,
of another change made in compliance with some other
objection of mine, he wrote on the 4th of October,
"You will receive the proof herewith. I have altered
it. You must let it stand now. I really think the dead
mankind a million fathoms deep, the best thing in the
sentence. I have a notion of the dreadful silence down
there, and of the stars shining down upon their drowned
eyes,&mdash;the fruit, let me tell you, of a solitary walk by
starlight on the cliffs. As to the child-image, I have
made a note of it for alteration. In number thirty
there will be some cutting needed, I think. I have,
however, something in my eye near the beginning which
I can easily take out. You will recognize a description
of the road we traveled between Birmingham and Wolverhampton;
but I had conceived it so well in my
mind that the execution doesn't please me quite as well
as I expected. I shall be curious to know whether you
think there's anything in the notion of the man and
his furnace-fire. It would have been a good thing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
have opened a new story with, I have been thinking
since."</p>

<p>In the middle of October he returned to town, and
by the end of the month he had so far advanced that
the close of the story began to be not far distant.
"Tell me what you think," he had written just before
his return, "of 36 and 37? The way is clear for Kit
now, and for a great effect at the last with the Marchioness."
The last allusion I could not in the least
understand, until I found, in the numbers just sent me,
those exquisite chapters of the tale, the 57th and 58th,
in which Dick Swiveller realizes his threat to Miss
Wackles, discovers the small creature that his destiny
is expressly saving up for him, dubs her Marchioness,
and teaches her the delights of hot purl and cribbage.
This is comedy of the purest kind; its great charm
being the good-hearted fellow's kindness to the poor
desolate child hiding itself under cover of what seems
only mirth and fun. Altogether, and because of rather
than in spite of his weakness, Dick is a captivating
person. His gayety and good humor survive such accumulations
of "staggerers," he makes such discoveries
of the "rosy" in the very smallest of drinks, and becomes
himself by his solacements of verse such a "perpetual
grand Apollo," that his failings are all forgiven,
and hearts resolutely shut against victims of destiny in
general open themselves freely to Dick Swiveller.</p>

<p>At the opening of November, there seems to have
been a wish on Maclise's part to try his hand at an
illustration for the story; but I do not remember that
it bore other fruit than a very pleasant day at Jack
Straw's Castle, where Dickens read one of the later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
numbers to us. "Maclise and myself (alone in the
carriage)," he wrote, "will be with you at two exactly.
We propose driving out to Hampstead and walking
there, if it don't rain in buckets'-full. I sha'n't send
Bradburys' the MS. of next number till to-morrow, for
it contains the shadow of the number after that, and I
want to read it to Mac, as, if he likes the subject, it
will furnish him with one, I think. You can't imagine
(gravely I write and speak) how exhausted I am to-day
with yesterday's labors. I went to bed last night
utterly dispirited and done up. All night I have been
pursued by the child; and this morning I am unrefreshed
and miserable. I don't know what to do with
myself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think the close of the story will be great."
Connected with the same design on Maclise's part
there was another reading, this time at my house, and
of the number shadowed forth by what had been read
at Hampstead. "I will bring the MS.," he writes on
the 12th of November, "and, for Mac's information
if needful, the number before it. I have only this
moment put the finishing touch to it. The difficulty
has been tremendous&mdash;the anguish unspeakable. I
didn't say six. Therefore dine at half-past five like a
Christian. I shall bring Mac at that hour."</p>

<p>He had sent me, shortly before, the chapters in which
the Marchioness nurses Dick in his fever, and puts his
favorite philosophy to the hard test of asking him
whether he has ever put pieces of orange-peel into cold
water and made believe it was wine. "If you make
believe very much, it's quite nice; but if you don't,
you know, it hasn't much flavor:" so it stood originally,
and to the latter word in the little creature's mouth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
I seem to have objected. Replying (on the 16th of
December) he writes, "'If you make believe very
much, it's quite nice; but if you don't, you know, it
seems as if it would bear a little more seasoning, certainly.'
I think that's better. Flavor is a common
word in cookery, and among cooks, and so I used it.
The part you cut out in the other number, which was
sent me this morning, I had put in with a view to
Quilp's last appearance on any stage, which is casting
its shadow upon my mind; but it will come well enough
without such a preparation, so I made no change. I
mean to shirk Sir Robert Inglis, and work to-night. I
have been solemnly revolving the general story all this
morning. The forty-fifth number will certainly close.
Perhaps this forty-first, which I am now at work on,
had better contain the announcement of <i>Barnaby?</i> I
am glad you like Dick and the Marchioness in that
sixty-fourth chapter. I thought you would."</p>

<p>Fast shortening as the life of little Nell was now, the
dying year might have seen it pass away; but I never
knew him wind up any tale with such a sorrowful
reluctance as this. He caught at any excuse to hold
his hand from it, and stretched to the utmost limit the
time left to complete it in. Christmas interposed its
delays too, so that Twelfth-night had come and gone
when I wrote to him in the belief that he was nearly
done. "Done!" he wrote back to me on Friday, the
7th; "Done!!! Why, bless you, I shall not be done
till Wednesday night. I only began yesterday, and this
part of the story is not to be galloped over, I can tell
you. I think it will come famously&mdash;but I am the
wretchedest of the wretched. It casts the most horrible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
shadow upon me, and it is as much as I can do to
keep moving at all. I tremble to approach the place
a great deal more than Kit; a great deal more than
Mr. Garland; a great deal more than the Single Gentleman.
I sha'n't recover it for a long time. Nobody
will miss her like I shall. It is such a very painful
thing to me, that I really cannot express my sorrow.
Old wounds bleed afresh when I only think of the way
of doing it: what the actual doing it will be, God
knows. I can't preach to myself the schoolmaster's
consolation, though I try. Dear Mary died yesterday,
when I think of this sad story. I don't know what to
say about dining to-morrow&mdash;perhaps you'll send up
to-morrow morning for news? That'll be the best way.
I have refused several invitations for this week and
next, determining to go nowhere till I had done. I
am afraid of disturbing the state I have been trying to
get into, and having to fetch it all back again." He
had finished, all but the last chapter, on the Wednesday
named; that was the 12th of January; and on the following
night he read to me the two chapters of Nell's
death, the seventy-first and seventy-second, with the
result described in a letter to me of the following Monday,
the 17th January, 1841:</p>

<p>"I can't help letting you know how much your
yesterday's letter pleased me. I felt sure you liked the
chapters when we read them on Thursday night, but it
was a great delight to have my impression so strongly
and heartily confirmed. You know how little value
I should set on what I had done, if all the world cried
out that it was good, and those whose good opinion and
approbation I value most were silent. The assurance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
that this little closing of the scene touches and is felt
by you so strongly, is better to me than a thousand most
sweet voices out of doors. When I first began, <i>on your
valued suggestion</i>, to keep my thoughts upon this ending
of the tale, I resolved to try and do something which
might be read by people about whom Death had been,
with a softened feeling, and with consolation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After
you left last night, I took my desk up-stairs, and,
writing until four o'clock this morning, finished the old
story. It makes me very melancholy to think that all
these people are lost to me forever, and I feel as if I
never could become attached to any new set of characters."
The words printed in italics, as underlined
by himself, give me my share in the story which had gone
so closely to his heart. I was responsible for its tragic
ending. He had not thought of killing her, when,
about half-way through, I asked him to consider whether
it did not necessarily belong even to his own conception,
after taking so mere a child through such a tragedy
of sorrow, to lift her also out of the commonplace of
ordinary happy endings so that the gentle pure little
figure and form should never change to the fancy. All
that I meant he seized at once, and never turned aside
from it again.</p>

<p>The published book was an extraordinary success,
and, in America more especially, very greatly increased
the writer's fame. The pathetic vein it had opened
was perhaps mainly the cause of this, but opinion at
home continued still to turn on the old characteristics,&mdash;the
freshness of humor of which the pathos was but
another form and product, the grasp of reality with
which character had again been seized, the discernment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of good under its least attractive forms and of evil in its
most captivating disguises, the cordial wisdom and sound
heart, the enjoyment and fun, luxuriant yet under proper
control. No falling-off was found in these; and I doubt
if any of his people have been more widely liked than
Dick Swiveller and the Marchioness. The characters
generally, indeed, work out their share in the purpose
of the tale; the extravagances of some of them help to
intensify its meaning; and the sayings and doings of
the worst and the best alike have their point and applicability.
Many an oversuspicious person will find advantage
in remembering what a too liberal application
of Foxey's principle of suspecting everybody brought
Mr. Sampson Brass to; and many an overhasty judgment
of poor human nature will unconsciously be
checked, when it is remembered that Mr. Christopher
Nubbles <i>did</i> come back to work out that shilling.</p>

<p>But the main idea and chief figure of the piece constitute
its interest for most people, and give it rank
upon the whole with the most attractive productions of
English fiction. I am not acquainted with any story
in the language more adapted to strengthen in the
heart what most needs help and encouragement, to
sustain kindly and innocent impulses, and to awaken
everywhere the sleeping germs of good. It includes
necessarily much pain, much uninterrupted sadness;
and yet the brightness and sunshine quite overtop the
gloom. The humor is so benevolent; the view of
errors that have no depravity of heart in them is so
indulgent; the quiet courage under calamity, the purity
that nothing impure can soil, are so full of tender teaching.
Its effect as a mere piece of art, too, considering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the circumstances in which I have shown it to be written,
I think very noteworthy. It began with a plan
for but a short half-dozen chapters; it grew into a full-proportioned
story under the warmth of the feeling it
had inspired its writer with; its very incidents created
a necessity at first not seen; and it was carried to a
close only contemplated after a full half of it had been
written. Yet, from the opening of the tale to that undesigned
ending,&mdash;from the image of little Nell asleep
amid the quaint grotesque figures of the old curiosity
warehouse to that other final sleep she takes among the
grim forms and carvings of the old church aisle,&mdash;the
main purpose seems to be always present. The characters
and incidents that at first appear most foreign to it
are found to have had with it a close relation. The
hideous lumber and rottenness that surround the child
in her grandfather's home take shape again in Quilp
and his filthy gang. In the first still picture of Nell's
innocence in the midst of strange and alien forms, we
have the forecast of her after-wanderings, her patient
miseries, her sad maturity of experience before its time.
Without the show-people and their blended fictions and
realities, their wax-works, dwarfs, giants, and performing
dogs, the picture would have wanted some part
of its significance. Nor could the genius of Hogarth
himself have given it higher expression than in the
scenes by the cottage door, the furnace-fire, and the
burial-place of the old church, over whose tombs and
gravestones hang the puppets of Mr. Punch's show
while the exhibitors are mending and repairing them.
And when, at last, Nell sits within the quiet old church
where all her wanderings end, and gazes on those silent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
monumental groups of warriors,&mdash;helmets, swords, and
gauntlets wasting away around them,&mdash;the associations
among which her life had opened seem to have come
crowding on the scene again, to be present at its close,&mdash;but
stripped of their strangeness; deepened into
solemn shapes by the suffering she has undergone;
gently fusing every feeling of a life past into hopeful
and familiar anticipation of a life to come; and already
imperceptibly lifting her, without grief or pain, from
the earth she loves, yet whose grosser paths her light
steps only touched to show the track through them to
heaven. This is genuine art, and such as all cannot
fail to recognize who read the book in a right sympathy
with the conception that pervades it. Nor, great as the
discomfort was of reading it in brief weekly snatches,
can I be wholly certain that the discomfort of so writing
it involved nothing but disadvantage. With so much
in every portion to do, and so little space to do it in,
the opportunities to a writer for mere self-indulgence
were necessarily rare.</p>

<p>Of the innumerable tributes the story has received,
and to none other by Dickens have more or more various
been paid, there is one, the very last, which has
much affected me. Not many months before my friend's
death, he had sent me two <i>Overland Monthlies</i> containing
two sketches by a young American writer far away
in California, "The Luck of Roaring Camp," and
"The Outcasts of Poker Flat," in which he had found
such subtle strokes of character as he had not anywhere
else in late years discovered; the manner resembling
himself, but the matter fresh to a degree that had surprised
him; the painting in all respects masterly, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the wild rude thing painted a quite wonderful reality.
I have rarely known him more honestly moved. A few
months passed; telegraph-wires flashed over the world
that he had passed away on the 9th of June; and the
young writer of whom he had then written to me, all
unconscious of that praise, put his tribute of gratefulness
and sorrow into the form of a poem called <i>Dickens
in Camp</i>.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It embodies the same kind of incident
which had so affected the master himself, in the papers
to which I have referred; it shows the gentler influences
which, in even those Californian wilds, can
restore outlawed "roaring camps" to silence and humanity;
and there is hardly any form of posthumous
tribute which I can imagine likely to have better satisfied
his desire of fame than one which should thus
connect, with the special favorite among all his heroines,
the restraints and authority exerted by his genius
over the rudest and least civilized of competitors in
that far fierce race for wealth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was an excellent saying of the first Lord Shaftesbury,
that, seeing every man of any capacity holds within
himself two men, the wise and the foolish, each of them
ought freely to be allowed his turn; and it was one of
the secrets of Dickens's social charm that he could, in
strict accordance with this saying, allow each part of
him its turn; could afford thoroughly to give rest and
relief to what was serious in him, and, when the time
came to play his gambols, could surrender himself
wholly to the enjoyment of the time, and become the
very genius and embodiment of one of his own most
whimsical fancies.</p>

<p>Turning back from the narrative of his last piece of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
writing to recall a few occurrences of the year during
which it had occupied him, I find him at its opening in
one of these humorous moods, and another friend, with
myself, enslaved by its influence. "What on earth does
it all mean?" wrote poor puzzled Mr. Landor to me,
inclosing a letter from him of the date of the 11th of
February, the day after the royal nuptials of that year.
In this he had related to our old friend a wonderful
hallucination arising out of that event, which had then
taken entire possession of him. "Society is unhinged
here," thus ran the letter, "by her majesty's marriage,
and I am sorry to add that I have fallen hopelessly in
love with the Queen, and wander up and down with
vague and dismal thoughts of running away to some uninhabited
island with a maid of honor, to be entrapped
by conspiracy for that purpose. Can you suggest any
particular young person, serving in such a capacity, who
would suit me? It is too much perhaps to ask you to
join the band of noble youths (Forster is in it, and
Maclise) who are to assist me in this great enterprise,
but a man of your energy would be invaluable. I have
my eye upon Lady .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;, principally because she is
very beautiful and has no strong brothers. Upon this,
and other points of the scheme, however, we will confer
more at large when we meet; and meanwhile burn this
document, that no suspicion may arise or rumor get
abroad."</p>

<p>The maid of honor and the uninhabited island were
flights of fancy, but the other daring delusion was for a
time encouraged to such whimsical lengths, not alone
by him, but (under his influence) by the two friends
named, that it took the wildest forms of humorous extravagance;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and of the private confidences much interchanged,
as well as of the style of open speech in
which our joke of despairing unfitness for any further
use or enjoyment of life was unflaggingly kept up, to
the amazement of bystanders knowing nothing of what
it meant, and believing we had half lost our senses, I
permit myself to give from his letters one further illustration.
"I am utterly lost in misery," he writes to me
on the 12th of February, "and can do nothing. I
have been reading <i>Oliver</i>, <i>Pickwick</i>, and <i>Nickleby</i> to
get my thoughts together for the new effort, but all in
vain:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"My heart is at Windsor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">My heart isn't here;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My heart is at Windsor.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A following my dear.</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>I saw the Responsibilities this morning, and burst into
tears. The presence of my wife aggravates me. I
loathe my parents. I detest my house. I begin to have
thoughts of the Serpentine, of the Regent's Canal, of
the razors up-stairs, of the chemist's down the street,
of poisoning myself at Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s table, of hanging
myself upon the pear-tree in the garden, of abstaining
from food and starving myself to death, of being bled
for my cold and tearing off the bandage, of falling
under the feet of cab-horses in the New Road, of murdering
Chapman &amp; Hall and becoming great in story
(<span class="smcap">She</span> must hear something of me then&mdash;perhaps sign
the warrant: or is that a fable?), of turning Chartist, of
heading some bloody assault upon the palace and saving
Her by my single hand&mdash;of being anything but
what I have been, and doing anything but what I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
done. Your distracted friend, C. D." The wild derangement
of asterisks in every shape and form, with
which this incoherence closed, cannot here be given.</div>

<p>Some ailments which dated from an earlier period in his
life made themselves felt in the spring of the year, as I remember,
and increased horse-exercise was strongly recommended
to him. "I find it will be positively necessary
to go, for five days in the week, at least," he wrote to me
in March, "on a perfect regimen of diet and exercise, and
am anxious therefore not to delay treating for a horse."
We were now in consequence, when he was not at the
sea-side, much on horseback in suburban lanes and
roads; and the spacious garden of his new house was
also turned to healthful use at even his busiest times of
work. I mark this, too, as the time when the first of
his ravens took up residence there; and as the beginning
of disputes with two of his neighbors about the
smoking of the stable-chimney, which his groom Topping,
a highly absurd little man with flaming red hair,
so complicated by secret devices of his own, meant to
conciliate each complainant alternately and having the
effect of aggravating both, that law-proceedings were
only barely avoided. "I shall give you," he writes,
"my latest report of the chimney in the form of an
address from Topping, made to me on our way from
little Hall's at Norwood the other night, where he and
Chapman and I had been walking all day, while Topping
drove Kate, Mrs. Hall, and her sisters, to Dulwich.
Topping had been regaled upon the premises,
and was just drunk enough to be confidential. 'Beggin'
your pardon, sir, but the genelman next door sir,
seems to be gettin' quite comfortable and pleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
about the chimley.'&mdash;'I don't think he is, Topping.'&mdash;'Yes
he is sir I think. He comes out in the yard this
morning and says, <i>Coachman</i> he says' (observe the
vision of a great large fat man called up by the word)
<i>is that your raven</i> he says, <i>Coachman? or is it Mr.
Dickens's raven?</i> he says. My master's sir, I says.
Well, he says, It's a fine bird. <i>I think the chimley 'ill
do now Coachman,&mdash;now the jint's taken off the pipe</i> he
says. I hope it will sir, I says; my master's a genelman
as wouldn't annoy no genelman if he could help
it, I'm sure; and my missis is so afraid of havin' a bit
o' fire that o' Sundays our little bit o' weal or wot not,
goes to the baker's a purpose.&mdash;<i>Damn the chimley,
Coachman</i>, he says, <i>it's a smokin' now</i>.&mdash;It ain't a
smokin' your way sir, I says; Well he says <i>no more it
is, Coachman, and as long as it smokes anybody else's
way, it's all right and I'm agreeable</i>.' Of course I shall
now have the man from the other side upon me, and
very likely with an action of nuisance for smoking into
his conservatory."</p>

<p>A graver incident, which occurred to him also among
his earliest experiences as tenant of Devonshire Terrace,
illustrates too well the always practical turn of
his kindness and humanity not to deserve relation here.
He has himself described it in one of his minor writings,
in setting down what he remembered as the only
good that ever came of a beadle. Of that great parish
functionary, he says, "having newly taken the lease of
a house in a certain distinguished metropolitan parish,
a house which then appeared to me to be a frightfully
first-class family mansion involving awful responsibilities,
I became the prey." In other words, he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
summoned, and obliged to sit, as juryman at an inquest
on the body of a little child alleged to have been
murdered by its mother; of which the result was, that,
by his persevering exertion, seconded by the humane
help of the coroner, Mr. Wakley, the verdict of himself
and his fellow-jurymen charged her only with concealment
of the birth. "The poor desolate creature
dropped upon her knees before us with protestations
that we were right (protestations among the most
affecting that I have ever heard in my life), and was
carried away insensible. I caused some extra care to
be taken of her in the prison, and counsel to be retained
for her defense when she was tried at the Old
Bailey; and her sentence was lenient, and her history
and conduct proved that it was right." How much
he felt the little incident, at the actual time of its
occurrence, may be judged from the few lines written
to me next morning: "Whether it was the poor baby,
or its poor mother, or the coffin, or my fellow-jurymen,
or what not, I can't say, but last night I had a most
violent attack of sickness and indigestion, which not
only prevented me from sleeping, but even from lying
down. Accordingly Kate and I sat up through the
dreary watches."</p>

<p>The day of the first publication of <i>Master Humphrey</i>
(Saturday, 4th April) had by this time come, and, according
to the rule observed in his two other great ventures,
he left town with Mrs. Dickens on Friday, the
3d. With Maclise we had been together at Richmond
the previous night; and I joined him at Birmingham
the day following with news of the sale of the whole
sixty thousand copies to which the first working had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
been limited, and of orders already in hand for ten
thousand more! The excitement of the success somewhat
lengthened our holiday; and, after visiting Shakspeare's
house at Stratford and Johnson's at Lichfield,
we found our resources so straitened in returning, that,
employing as our messenger of need his younger brother
Alfred, who had joined us from Tamworth, where he
was a student-engineer, we had to pawn our gold
watches at Birmingham.</p>

<p>At the end of the following month he went to Broadstairs,
and not many days before (on the 20th of May)
a note from Mr. Jordan on behalf of Mr. Bentley
opened the negotiations formerly referred to,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> which
transferred to Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall the agreement
for <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>. I was myself absent when he left, and
in a letter announcing his departure he had written, "I
don't know of a word of news in all London, but there
will be plenty next week, for I am going away, and I
hope you'll send me an account of it. I am doubtful
whether it will be a murder, a fire, a vast robbery, or
the escape of Gould, but it will be something remarkable
no doubt. I almost blame myself for the death
of that poor girl who leaped off the monument upon
my leaving town last year. She would not have done
it if I had remained, neither would the two men have
found the skeleton in the sewers." His prediction was
quite accurate, for I had to tell him, after not many
days, of the potboy who shot at the queen. "It's a
great pity," he replied, very sensibly, "they couldn't
suffocate that boy, Master Oxford, and say no more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
about it. To have put him quietly between two feather
beds would have stopped his heroic speeches, and dulled
the sound of his glory very much. As it is, she will
have to run the gauntlet of many a fool and madman,
some of whom may perchance be better shots and use
other than Brummagem firearms." How much of this
actually came to pass, the reader knows.</p>

<p>From the letters of his present Broadstairs visit, there
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 's'">is</ins> little further to add to their account of his progress
with his story; but a couple more lines may be given
for their characteristic expression of his invariable <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hab'">habit</ins>
upon entering any new abode, whether to stay in it for
days or for years. On a Monday night he arrived, and
on the Tuesday (2d of June) wrote to me, "<i>Before</i> I
tasted bit or drop yesterday, I set out my writing-table
with extreme taste and neatness, and improved the
disposition of the furniture generally." He stayed till
the end of June; when Maclise and myself joined him
for the pleasure of posting back home with him and
Mrs. Dickens, by way of his favorite Chatham and
Rochester and Cobham, where we passed two agreeable
days in revisiting well-remembered scenes. I had meanwhile
brought to a close the treaty for repurchase of
<i>Oliver</i> and surrender of <i>Barnaby</i>, upon terms which
are succinctly stated in a letter written by him to Messrs.
Chapman &amp; Hall on the 2d of July, the day after our
return:</p>

<p>"The terms upon which you advance the money to-day
for the purchase of the copyright and stock<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
<i>Oliver</i> on my behalf are understood between us to be
these. That this 2250<i>l</i>. is to be deducted from the
purchase-money of a work by me entitled <i>Barnaby
Rudge</i>, of which two chapters are now in your hands,
and of which the whole is to be written within some
convenient time to be agreed upon between us. But
if it should not be written (which God forbid!) within
five years, you are to have a lien to this amount on the
property belonging to me that is now in your hands,
namely, my shares in the stock and copyright of
<i>Sketches by Boz</i>, <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>,
<i>Oliver Twist</i>, and <i>Master Humphrey's Clock;</i> in
which we do not include any share of the current profits
of the last-named work, which I shall remain at
liberty to draw at the times stated in our agreement.
Your purchase of <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> is made upon the
following terms. It is to consist of matter sufficient
for ten monthly numbers of the size of <i>Pickwick</i> and
<i>Nickleby</i>, which you are, however, at liberty to divide
and publish in fifteen smaller numbers if you think fit.
The terms for the purchase of this edition in numbers,
and for the copyright of the whole book for six months
after the publication of the last number, are 3000<i>l</i>. At
the expiration of the six months the whole copyright
reverts to me." The sequel was, as all the world
knows, that Barnaby became successor to Little Nell,
the money being repaid by the profits of the <i>Clock;</i>
but I ought to mention also the more generous sequel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
that my own small service had, on my receiving from
him, after not many days, an antique silver-mounted
jug of great beauty of form and workmanship, but with
a wealth far beyond jeweler's chasing or artist's design
in the written words that accompanied it.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> I accepted
them to commemorate, not the help they would have
far overpaid, but the gladness of his own escape from
the last of the agreements that had hampered the opening
of his career, and the better future that was now
before him.</p>

<p>At the opening of August he was with Mrs. Dickens
for some days in Devonshire, on a visit to his father,
but he had to take his work with him; and, as he wrote
to me, they had only one real holiday, when Dawlish,
Teignmouth, Babbicombe, and Torquay were explored,
returning to Exeter at night. In the beginning of
September he was again at Broadstairs.</p>

<p>"I was just going to work," he wrote on the 9th,
"when I got this letter, and the story of the man who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
went to Chapman &amp; Hall's knocked me down flat. I
wrote until now (a quarter to one) against the grain,
and have at last given it up for one day. Upon my
word it is intolerable. I have been grinding my teeth
all the morning. I think I could say in two lines
something about the general report with propriety. I'll
add them to the proof" (the preface to the first volume
of the <i>Clock</i> was at this time in preparation), "giving
you full power to cut them out if you should think
differently from me, and from C. and H., who in such
a matter must be admitted judges." He refers here to
a report, rather extensively circulated at the time, and
which through various channels had reached his publishers,
that he was suffering from loss of reason and
was under treatment in an asylum.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> I would have
withheld from him the mention of it, as an absurdity
that must quickly pass away, but against my wish it
had been communicated to him, and I had difficulty in
keeping within judicious bounds his extreme and very
natural wrath.</p>

<p>A few days later (the 15th) he wrote, "I have been
rather surprised of late to have applications from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Roman Catholic clergymen, demanding (rather pastorally,
and with a kind of grave authority) assistance,
literary employment, and so forth. At length it struck
me that, through some channel or other, I must have
been represented as belonging to that religion. Would
you believe that in a letter from Lamert, at Cork, to
my mother, which I saw last night, he says, 'What do
the papers mean by saying that Charles is demented,
and, further, <i>that he has turned Roman Catholic?'&mdash;!</i>"
Of the begging-letter-writers, hinted at here, I ought
earlier to have said something. In one of his detached
essays he has described, without a particle of exaggeration,
the extent to which he was made a victim by this
class of swindler, and the extravagance of the devices
practiced on him; but he has not confessed, as he
might, that for much of what he suffered he was
himself responsible, by giving so largely, as at first he
did, to almost every one who applied to him. What at
last brought him to his senses in this respect, I think,
was the request made by the adventurer who had exhausted
every other expedient, and who desired finally,
after describing himself reduced to the condition of a
traveling Cheap Jack in the smallest way of crockery,
that a donkey might be left out for him next day,
which he would duly call for. This I perfectly remember,
and I much fear that the applicant was the Daniel
Tobin before mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Many and delightful were other letters written from
Broadstairs at this date, filled with whimsical talk and
humorous description relating chiefly to an eccentric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
friend who stayed with him most of the time, and is
sketched in one of his published papers as Mr. Kindheart;
but all too private for reproduction now. He
returned in the middle of October, when we resumed
our almost daily ridings, foregatherings with Maclise at
Hampstead and elsewhere, and social entertainments
with Macready, Talfourd, Procter, Stanfield, Fonblanque,
Elliotson, Tennent, D'Orsay, Quin, Harness,
Wilkie, Edwin Landseer, Rogers, Sydney Smith, and
Bulwer. Of the genius of the author of <i>Pelham</i> and
<i>Eugene Aram</i> he had, early and late, the highest admiration,
and he took occasion to express it during the
present year in a new preface which he published to
<i>Oliver Twist</i>. Other friends became familiar in later
years; but, disinclined as he was to the dinner-invitations
that reached him from every quarter, all such
meetings with those whom I have named, and in an
especial manner the marked attentions shown him by
Miss Coutts which began with the very beginning of
his career, were invariably welcome.</p>

<p>To speak here of the pleasure his society afforded,
would anticipate the fitter mention to be made hereafter.
But what in this respect distinguishes nearly all
original men, he possessed eminently. His place was
not to be filled up by any other. To the most trivial
talk he gave the attraction of his own character. It
might be a small matter,&mdash;something he had read or
observed during the day, some quaint odd fancy from a
book, a vivid little out-door picture, the laughing exposure
of some imposture, or a burst of sheer mirthful
enjoyment,&mdash;but of its kind it would be something
unique, because genuinely part of himself. This, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
his unwearying animal spirits, made him the most delightful
of companions; no claim on good-fellowship
ever found him wanting; and no one so constantly
recalled to his friends the description Johnson gave of
Garrick, as the cheerfulest man of his age.</p>

<p>Of what occupied him in the way of literary labor in
the autumn and winter months of the year, some description
has been given; and, apart from what has
already thus been said of his work at the closing chapters
of <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>, nothing now calls for
more special allusion, except that in his town-walks in
November, impelled thereto by specimens recently discovered
in his country-walks between Broadstairs and
Ramsgate, he thoroughly explored the ballad literature
of Seven-Dials, and took to singing himself, with an
effect that justified his reputation for comic singing in
his childhood, not a few of these wonderful productions.
His last successful labor of the year was the
reconciliation of two friends; and his motive, as well
as the principle that guided him, as they are described
by himself, I think worth preserving. For the first:
"In the midst of this child's death, I, over whom
something of the bitterness of death has passed, not
lightly perhaps, was reminded of many old kindnesses,
and was sorry in my heart that men who really liked
each other should waste life at arm's length." For the
last: "I have laid it down as a rule in my judgment of
men, to observe narrowly whether some (of whom one
is disposed to think badly) don't carry all their faults
upon the surface, and others (of whom one is disposed
to think well) don't carry many more beneath it. I
have long ago made sure that our friend is in the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
class; and when I know all the foibles a man has, with
little trouble in the discovery, I begin to think he is
worth liking." His latest letter of the year, dated the
day following, closed with the hope that we might, he
and I, enjoy together "fifty more Christmases, at least,
in this world, and eternal summers in another." Alas!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> letters of 1841 yield similar fruit as to his doings
and sayings, and may in like manner first be consulted
for the literary work he had in hand.</p>

<p>He had the advantage of beginning <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>
with a fair amount of story in advance, which he had
only to make suitable, by occasional readjustment of
chapters, to publication in weekly portions; and on
this he was engaged before the end of January. "I
am at present" (22d January, 1841) "in what Leigh
Hunt would call a kind of impossible state,&mdash;thinking
what on earth Master Humphrey can think of through
four mortal pages. I added, here and there, to the last
chapter of the <i>Curiosity Shop</i> yesterday, and it leaves
me only four pages to write." (They were filled by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
paper from Humphrey introductory of the new tale, in
which will be found a striking picture of London from
midnight to the break of day.) "I also made up, and
wrote the needful insertions for, the second number of
<i>Barnaby</i>,&mdash;so that I came back to the mill a little."
Hardly yet; for after four days he writes, having meanwhile
done nothing, "I have been looking (three
o'clock) with an appearance of extraordinary interest
and study at <i>one leaf</i> of the <i>Curiosities of Literature</i> ever
since half-past ten this morning&mdash;I haven't the heart to
turn over." Then on Friday the 29th better news
came. "I didn't stir out yesterday, but sat and <i>thought</i>
all day; not writing a line; not so much as the cross
of a t or dot of an i. I imaged forth a good deal
of <i>Barnaby</i> by keeping my mind steadily upon him;
and am happy to say I have gone to work this morning
in good twig, strong hope, and cheerful spirits. Last
night I was unutterably and impossible-to-form-an-idea-of-ably
miserable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. By-the-by, don't engage
yourself otherwise than to me for Sunday week, because
it's my birthday. I have no doubt we shall have got
over our troubles here by that time, and I purpose
having a snug dinner in the study." We had the dinner,
though the troubles were not over; but the next
day another son was born to him. "Thank God," he
wrote on the 9th, "quite well. I am thinking hard,
and have just written to Browne inquiring when he will
come and confer about the raven." He had by this
time resolved to make that bird, whose accomplishments
had been daily ripening and enlarging for the last twelve
months to the increasing mirth and delight of all of us,
a prominent figure in <i>Barnaby;</i> and the invitation to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the artist was for a conference how best to introduce
him graphically.</p>

<p>The next letter mentioning <i>Barnaby</i> was from Brighton
(25th February), whither he had flown for a week's
quiet labor: "I have (it's four o'clock) done a very
fair morning's work, at which I have sat very close,
and been blessed besides with a clear view of the end
of the volume. As the contents of one number usually
require a day's thought at the very least, and often
more, this puts me in great spirits. I think&mdash;that is,
I hope&mdash;the story takes a great stride at this point, and
takes it <span class="smcap">well</span>. Nous verrons. Grip will be strong,
and I build greatly on the Varden household."</p>

<p>Upon his return he had to lament a domestic calamity,
which, for its connection with that famous personage in
<i>Barnaby</i>, must be mentioned here. The raven had for
some days been ailing, and Topping had reported of
him, as Shakspeare of Hamlet, that he had lost his
mirth and foregone all customary exercises; but Dickens
paid no great heed, remembering his recovery from
an illness of the previous summer when he swallowed
some white paint; so that the graver report which led
him to send for the doctor came upon him unexpectedly,
and nothing but his own language can worthily
describe the result. Unable from the state of his feelings
to write two letters, he sent the narrative to Maclise,
under an enormous black seal, for transmission to
me; and thus it befell that this fortunate bird receives
a double passport to fame, so great a humorist having
celebrated his farewell to the present world, and so
great a painter his welcome to another.</p>

<p>"You will be greatly shocked" (the letter is dated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Friday evening, March 12, 1841) "and grieved to hear
that the Raven is no more. He expired to-day at a
few minutes after twelve o'clock at noon. He had
been ailing for a few days, but we anticipated no serious
result, conjecturing that a portion of the white paint he
swallowed last summer might be lingering about his
vitals without having any serious effect upon his constitution.
Yesterday afternoon he was taken so much
worse that I sent an express for the medical gentleman
(Mr. Herring), who promptly attended, and administered
a powerful dose of castor oil. Under the influence
of this medicine, he recovered so far as to be able
at eight o'clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> to bite Topping. His night was
peaceful. This morning at daybreak he appeared better;
received (agreeably to the doctor's directions)
another dose of castor oil; and partook plentifully of
some warm gruel, the flavor of which he appeared to
relish. Towards eleven o'clock he was so much worse
that it was found necessary to muffle the stable-knocker.
At half-past, or thereabouts, he was heard talking to
himself about the horse and Topping's family, and to
add some incoherent expressions which are supposed
to have been either a foreboding of his approaching
dissolution, or some wishes relative to the disposal of
his little property: consisting chiefly of half-pence
which he had buried in different parts of the garden.
On the clock striking twelve he appeared slightly
agitated, but he soon recovered, walked twice or thrice
along the coach-house, stopped to bark, staggered,
exclaimed <i>Halloa old girl!</i> (his favorite expression),
and died.</p>

<p>"He behaved throughout with a decent fortitude,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
equanimity, and self-possession, which cannot be too
much admired. I deeply regret that being in ignorance
of his danger I did not attend to receive his last
instructions. Something remarkable about his eyes
occasioned Topping to run for the doctor at twelve.
When they returned together our friend was gone. It
was the medical gentleman who informed me of his
decease. He did it with great caution and delicacy,
preparing me by the remark that 'a jolly queer start
had taken place;' but the shock was very great notwithstanding.
I am not wholly free from suspicions of
poison. A malicious butcher has been heard to say
that he would 'do' for him: his plea was that he would
not be molested in taking orders down the mews, by
any bird that wore a tail. Other persons have also
been heard to threaten: among others, Charles Knight,
who has just started a weekly publication price fourpence:
<i>Barnaby</i> being, as you know, threepence. I
have directed a post-mortem examination, and the body
has been removed to Mr. Herring's school of anatomy
for that purpose.</p>

<p>"I could wish, if you can take the trouble, that you
could inclose this to Forster immediately after you
have read it. I cannot discharge the painful task of
communication more than once. Were they ravens
who took manna to somebody in the wilderness? At
times I hope they were, and at others I fear they were
not, or they would certainly have stolen it by the way.
In profound sorrow, I am ever your bereaved friend
C. D. Kate is as well as can be expected, but terribly
low, as you may suppose. The children seem rather
glad of it. He bit their ankles. But that was play."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 402px;">
<img src="images/image04_letter_about_bird.jpg" width="402" height="500" alt="Letter about Bird" title="Letter about Bird" />

<p>Maclise's covering letter was an apotheosis, to be
rendered only in fac-simile.</p>

<p>In what way the loss was replaced, so that <i>Barnaby</i>
should have the fruit of continued study of the habits
of the family of birds which Grip had so nobly represented,
Dickens has told in the preface to the story;
and another, older, and larger Grip, obtained through
Mr. Smithson, was installed in the stable, almost before
the stuffed remains of his honored predecessor had been
sent home in a glass case, by way of ornament to his
master's study.</p>

<p>I resume our correspondence on what he was writing:
"I see there is yet room for a few lines" (25th March),
"and you are quite right in wishing what I cut out to
be restored. I did not want Joe to be so short about
Dolly, and really wrote his references to that young
lady carefully,&mdash;as natural things with a meaning in
them. Chigwell, my dear fellow, is the greatest place
in the world. Name your day for going. Such a
delicious old inn opposite the churchyard,&mdash;such a
lovely ride,&mdash;such beautiful forest scenery,&mdash;such an
out-of-the-way, rural place,&mdash;such a sexton! I say
again, name your day." The day was named at once;
and the whitest of stones marks it, in now sorrowful
memory. His promise was exceeded by our enjoyment;
and his delight in the double recognition, of himself
and of <i>Barnaby</i>, by the landlord of the nice old inn,
far exceeded any pride he would have taken in what the
world thinks the highest sort of honor.</p>

<p>"I have shut myself up" (26th March) "by myself
to-day, and mean to try and 'go it' at the <i>Clock;</i> Kate
being out, and the house peacefully dismal. I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
remember altering the exact part you object to, but if
there be anything here you object to, knock it out ruthlessly."
"Don't fail" (April the 5th) "to erase anything
that seems to you too strong. It is difficult for
me to judge what tells too much, and what does not. I
am trying a very quiet number to set against this
necessary one. I hope it will be good, but I am in
very sad condition for work. Glad you think this
powerful. What I have put in is more relief, from the
raven." Two days later: "I have done that number,
and am now going to work on another. I am bent
(please Heaven) on finishing the first chapter by Friday
night. I hope to look in upon you to-night, when we'll
dispose of the toasts for Saturday. Still bilious&mdash;but a
good number, I hope, notwithstanding. Jeffrey has
come to town, and was here yesterday." The toasts to
be disposed of were those to be given at the dinner on
the 10th to celebrate the second volume of <i>Master
Humphrey:</i> when Talfourd presided, when there was
much jollity, and, according to the memorandum drawn
up that Saturday night now lying before me, we all in
the greatest good humor glorified each other: Talfourd
proposing the <i>Clock</i>, Macready Mrs. Dickens, Dickens
the publishers, and myself the artists; Macready giving
Talfourd, Talfourd Macready, Dickens myself, and
myself the comedian Mr. Harley, whose humorous
songs had been the not least considerable element in
the mirth of the evening.</p>

<p>Five days later he writes, "I finished the number
yesterday, and, although I dined with Jeffrey, and was
obliged to go to Lord Denman's afterwards (which
made me late), have done eight slips of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> <i>Lamplighter</i>
for Mrs. Macrone, this morning. When I have got
that off my mind, I shall try to go on steadily, fetching
up the <i>Clock</i> lee-way." The <i>Lamplighter</i> was his
old farce,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> which he now turned into a comic tale;
and this, with other contributions given him by friends
and edited by him as <i>Pic Nic Papers</i>, enabled him to
help the widow of his old publisher in her straitened
means by a gift of &pound;300. He had finished his work
of charity before he next wrote of <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>, but
he was fetching up his lee-way lazily. "I am getting
on" (29th of April) "very slowly. I want to stick to
the story; and the fear of committing myself, because
of the impossibility of trying back or altering a syllable,
makes it much harder than it looks. It was too
bad of me to give you the trouble of cutting the number,
but I knew so well you would do it in the right
places. For what Harley would call the 'onward
work' I really think I have some famous thoughts."
There is an interval of a month before the next allusion:
"Solomon's expression" (3d of June) "I meant
to be one of those strong ones to which strong circumstances
give birth in the commonest minds. Deal with
it as you like.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Say what you please of Gordon"
(I had objected to some points in his view of this madman,
stated much too favorably as I thought), "he
must have been at heart a kind man, and a lover of the
despised and rejected, after his own fashion. He lived
upon a small income, and always within it; was known
to relieve the necessities of many people; exposed in
his place the corrupt attempt of a minister to buy him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
out of Parliament; and did great charities in Newgate.
He always spoke on the people's side, and tried against
his muddled brains to expose the profligacy of both
parties. He never got anything by his madness, and
never sought it. The wildest and most raging attacks
of the time allow him these merits: and not to let
him have 'em in their full extent, remembering in what
a (politically) wicked time he lived, would lie upon
my conscience heavily. The libel he was imprisoned
for when he died, was on the Queen of France; and
the French government interested themselves warmly
to procure his release,&mdash;which I think they might have
done, but for Lord Grenville." I was more successful
in the counsel I gave against a fancy he had at this part
of the story, that he would introduce as actors in the
Gordon riots three splendid fellows who should order,
lead, control, and be obeyed as natural guides of the
crowd in that delirious time, and who should turn out,
when all was over, to have broken out from Bedlam;
but, though he saw the unsoundness of this, he could
not so readily see, in Gordon's case, the danger of
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'axing'">taxing</ins> ingenuity to ascribe a reasonable motive to acts
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'f'">of</ins> sheer insanity. The feeblest parts of the book
are those in which Lord George and his secretary
appear.</p>

<p>He left for Scotland after the middle of June, but he
took work with him. "You may suppose," he wrote
from Edinburgh on the 30th, "I have not done much
work; but by Friday night's post from here I hope to
send the first long chapter of a number and both the
illustrations; from Loch Earn on Tuesday night, the
closing chapter of that number; from the same place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
on Thursday night, the first long chapter of another,
with both the illustrations; and, from some place which
no man ever spelt but which sounds like Ballyhoolish,
on Saturday, the closing chapter of that number, which
will leave us all safe till I return to town." Nine days
later he wrote from "Ballechelish," "I have done all I
can or need do in the way of <i>Barnaby</i> until I come
home, and the story is progressing (I hope you will
think) to good strong interest. I have left it, I think,
at an exciting point, with a good dawning of the riots.
In the first of the two numbers I have written since I
have been away, I forget whether the blind man, in
speaking to Barnaby about riches, tells him they are to
be found in <i>crowds</i>. If I have not actually used that
word, will you introduce it? A perusal of the proof of
the following number (70) will show you how, and why."
"Have you," he wrote shortly after his return (29th
July), "seen No. 71? I thought there was a good
glimpse of a crowd, from a window&mdash;eh?" He had
now taken thoroughly to the interest of his closing chapters,
and felt more than ever the constraints of his form
of publication. "I am warming up very much" (on
the 5th August from Broadstairs) "about <i>Barnaby</i>.
Oh! if I only had him, from this time to the end, in
monthly numbers. <i>N'importe!</i> I hope the interest
will be pretty strong,&mdash;and, in every number, stronger."
Six days later, from the same place: "I was always sure
I could make a good thing of <i>Barnaby</i>, and I think
you'll find that it comes out strong to the last word. I
have another number ready, all but two slips. Don't
fear for young Chester. The time hasn't come&mdash;&mdash;there
we go again, you see, with the weekly delays. I am in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
great heart and spirits with the story, and with the prospect
of having time to think before I go on again." A
month's interval followed, and what occupied it will be
described shortly. On the 11th September he wrote,
"I have just burnt into Newgate, and am going in the
next number to tear the prisoners out by the hair of
their heads. The number which gets into the jail you'll
have in proof by Tuesday." This was followed up a
week later: "I have let all the prisoners out of Newgate,
burnt down Lord Mansfield's, and played the very
devil. Another number will finish the fires, and help
us on towards the end. I feel quite smoky when I am
at work. I want elbow-room terribly." To this trouble,
graver supervened at his return, a serious personal
sickness not the least; but he bore up gallantly, and I
had never better occasion than now to observe his quiet
endurance of pain, how little he thought of himself
where the sense of self is commonly supreme, and the
manful duty with which everything was done that, ailing
as he was, he felt it necessary to do. He was still in
his sick-room (22d October) when he wrote, "I hope I
sha'n't leave off any more, now, until I have finished
<i>Barnaby</i>." Three days after that, he was busying himself
eagerly for others; and on the 2d of November the
printers received the close of <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>.</p>

<p>This tale was Dickens's first attempt out of the sphere
of the life of the day and its actual manners. Begun
during the progress of <i>Oliver Twist</i>, it had been for
some time laid aside; the form it ultimately took had
been comprised only partially within its first design;
and the story in its finished shape presented strongly a
special purpose, the characteristic of all but his very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
earliest writings. Its scene is laid at the time when the
incessant execution of men and women, comparatively
innocent, disgraced every part of the country; demoralizing
thousands, whom it also prepared for the scaffold.
In those days the theft of a few rags from a bleaching-ground,
or the abstraction of a roll of ribbons from a
counter, was visited with the penalty of blood; and
such laws brutalized both their ministers and victims.
It was the time, too, when a false religious outcry
brought with it appalling guilt and misery. These
are vices that leave more behind them than the first
forms assumed, and they involve a lesson sufficiently
required to justify a writer in dealing with them. There
were also others grafted on them. In Barnaby himself
it was desired to show what sources of comfort there
might be, for the patient and cheerful heart, in even
the worst of all human afflictions; and in the hunted
life of his outcast father, whose crime had entailed not
that affliction only but other more fearful wretchedness,
we have as powerful a picture as any in his writings of
the inevitable and unfathomable consequences of sin.
But, as the story went on, it was incident to these designs
that what had been accomplished in its predecessor
could hardly be attained here, in singleness of
purpose, unity of idea, or harmony of treatment; and
other defects supervened in the management of the
plot. The interest with which the tale begins has
ceased to be its interest before the close; and what has
chiefly taken the reader's fancy at the outset almost
wholly disappears in the power and passion with which,
in the later chapters, the great riots are described. So
admirable is this description, however, that it would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
hard to have to surrender it even for a more perfect
structure of fable.</p>

<p>There are few things more masterly in any of his
books. From the first low mutterings of the storm to
its last terrible explosion, this frantic outbreak of
popular ignorance and rage is depicted with unabated
power. The aimlessness of idle mischief by which the
ranks of the rioters are swelled at the beginning; the
recklessness induced by the monstrous impunity allowed
to the early excesses; the sudden spread of this drunken
guilt into every haunt of poverty, ignorance, or mischief
in the wicked old city, where the rich materials
of crime lie festering; the wild action of its poison on
all, without scheme or plan of any kind, who come
within its reach; the horrors that are more bewildering
for this complete absence of purpose in them; and,
when all is done, the misery found to have been self-inflicted
in every cranny and corner of London, as if a
plague had swept over the streets: these are features in
the picture of an actual occurrence, to which the manner
of the treatment gives extraordinary force and
meaning. Nor, in the sequel, is there anything displayed
with more profitable vividness than the law's
indiscriminate cruelty at last, in contrast with its
cowardly indifference at first; while, among the casual
touches lighting up the scene with flashes of reality
that illumine every part of it, may be instanced the
discovery, in the quarter from which screams for succor
are loudest when Newgate is supposed to be accidentally
on fire, of four men who were certain in any case to
have perished on the drop next day.</p>

<p>The story, which has unusually careful writing in it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and much manly upright thinking, has not so many
people eagerly adopted as of kin by everybody, as its
predecessors are famous for; but it has yet a fair proportion
of such as take solid form within the mind and
keep hold of the memory. To these belong in an
especial degree Gabriel Varden and his household, on
whom are lavished all the writer's fondness and not a
little of his keenest humor. The honest locksmith
with his jovial jug, and the tink-tink-tink of his pleasant
nature making cheerful music out of steel and iron;
the buxom wife, with her plaguy tongue that makes
every one wretched whom her kindly disposition would
desire to make happy; the good-hearted plump little
Dolly, coquettish minx of a daughter, with all she
suffers and inflicts by her fickle winning ways and her
small self-admiring vanities; and Miggs the vicious and
slippery, acid, amatory, and of uncomfortable figure,
sower of family discontents and discords, who swears
all the while she wouldn't make or meddle with 'em
"not for a annual gold-mine and found in tea and
sugar:" there is not much social painting anywhere
with a better domestic moral than in all these; and a
nice propriety of feeling and thought regulates the use
of such satire throughout. No one knows more exactly
how far to go with that formidable weapon, or understands
better that what satirizes everything, in effect
satirizes nothing.</p>

<p>Another excellent group is that which the story opens
with, in the quaint old kitchen of the Maypole; John
Willett and his friends, genuinely comic creations all
of them. Then we have Barnaby and his raven: the
light-hearted idiot, as unconscious of guilt as of suffering,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and happy with no sense but of the influences of
nature; and the grave sly bird, with sufficient sense to
make himself as unhappy as rascally habits will make
the human animal. There is poor brutish Hugh, too,
loitering lazily outside the Maypole door, with a storm
of passions in him raging to be let loose; already the
scaffold's withered fruit, as he is doomed to be its ripe
offering; and though with all the worst instincts of the
savage, yet not without also some of the best. Still
farther out of kindly nature's pitying reach lurks the
worst villain of the scene: with this sole claim to consideration,
that it was by constant contact with the
filthiest instrument of law and state he had become the
mass of moral filth he is. Mr. Dennis the hangman is
a portrait that Hogarth would have painted with the
same wholesome severity of satire which is employed
upon it in <i>Barnaby Rudge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the occurrences of the year, apart from the
tale he was writing, the birth of his fourth child and
second son has been briefly mentioned. "I mean to
call the boy Edgar," he wrote, the day after he was
born (9th February), "a good honest Saxon name, I
think." He changed his mind in a few days, however,
on resolving to ask Landor to be godfather. This
intention, as soon as formed, he announced to our
excellent old friend, telling him it would give the
child something to boast of, to be called Walter Landor,
and that to call him so would do his own heart
good. For, as to himself, whatever realities had gone
out of the ceremony of christening, the meaning still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
remained in it of enabling him to form a relationship
with friends he most loved; and as to the boy, he held
that to give him a name to be proud of was to give
him also another reason for doing nothing unworthy
or untrue when he came to be a man. Walter, alas!
only lived to manhood. He obtained a military cadetship
through the kindness of Miss Coutts, and died at
Calcutta on the last day of 1863, in his twenty-third
year.</p>

<p>The interest taken by this distinguished lady in him
and in his had begun, as I have said, at an earlier date
than even this; and I remember, while <i>Oliver Twist</i>
was going on, his pleasure because of her father's mention
of him in a speech at Birmingham, for his advocacy
of the cause of the poor. Whether to the new
poor-law Sir Francis Burdett objected as strongly as we
have seen that Dickens did, as well as many other excellent
men, who forgot the atrocities of the system it
displaced in their indignation at the needless and cruel
harshness with which it was worked at the outset, I
have not at hand the means of knowing. But certainly
this continued to be strongly the feeling of Dickens,
who exulted in nothing so much as at any misadventure
to the Whigs in connection with it. "How often used
Black and I," he wrote to me in April, "to quarrel
about the effect of the poor-law bill! Walter comes in
upon the cry. See whether the Whigs go out upon it."
It was the strong desire he had to make himself heard
upon it, even in Parliament, that led him not immediately
to turn aside from a proposal, now privately made
by some of the magnates of Reading, to bring him in
for that borough; but the notion was soon dismissed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
as, on its revival more than once in later times, it continued
very wisely to be. His opinions otherwise were
extremely radical at present, as will be apparent shortly;
and he did not at all relish Peel's majority of one when
it came soon after, and unseated the Whigs. It was
just now, I may add, he greatly enjoyed a quiet setting-down
of Moore by Rogers at Sir Francis Burdett's
table, for talking exaggerated toryism. So debased was
the House of Commons by reform, said Moore, that a
Burke, if you could find him, would not be listened to.
"No such thing, Tommy," said Rogers; "<i>find yourself</i>,
and they'd listen even to you."</p>

<p>This was not many days before he hinted to me an
intention soon to be carried out in a rather memorable
manner: "I have done nothing to-day" (18th March:
we had bought books together, the day before, at Tom
Hill's sale) "but cut the <i>Swift</i>, looking into it with a
delicious laziness in all manner of delightful places, and
put poor Tom's books away. I had a letter from Edinburgh
this morning, announcing that Jeffrey's visit to
London will be the week after next; telling me that he
drives about Edinburgh declaring there has been 'nothing
so good as Nell since Cordelia,' which he writes
also to all manner of people; and informing me of a
desire in that romantic town to give me greeting and
welcome. For this and other reasons I am disposed to
make Scotland my destination in June rather than Ireland.
Think, <i>do</i> think, meantime (here are ten good
weeks), whether you couldn't, by some effort worthy
of the owner of the gigantic helmet, go with us. Think
of such a fortnight,&mdash;York, Carlisle, Berwick, your
own Borders, Edinburgh, Rob Roy's country, railroads,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
cathedrals, country inns, Arthur's Seat, lochs, glens,
and home by sea. DO think of this, seriously, at
leisure." It was very tempting, but not to be.</p>

<p>Early in April Jeffrey came, many feasts and entertainments
welcoming him, of which he very sparingly
partook; and before he left, the visit to Scotland in
June was all duly arranged, to be initiated by the
splendid welcome of a public dinner in Edinburgh,
with Lord Jeffrey himself in the chair. Allan the
painter had come up meanwhile, with increasing note
of preparation; and it was while we were all regretting
Wilkie's absence abroad, and Dickens with warrantable
pride was saying how surely the great painter would
have gone to this dinner, that the shock of his sudden
death<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> came, and there was left but the sorrowful satisfaction
of honoring his memory. There was one other
change before the day. "I heard from Edinburgh this
morning," he wrote on the 15th of June. "Jeffrey is
not well enough to take the chair, so Wilson does. I
think under all circumstances of politics, acquaintance,
and <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, that it's much better as it is&mdash;Don't
you?"</p>

<p>His first letter from Edinburgh, where he and Mrs.
Dickens had taken up quarters at the Royal Hotel on
their arrival the previous night, is dated the 23d of
June: "I have been this morning to the Parliament
House, and am now introduced (I hope) to everybody
in Edinburgh. The hotel is perfectly besieged, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
I have been forced to take refuge in a sequestered
apartment at the end of a long passage, wherein I
write this letter. They talk of 300 at the dinner.
We are very well off in point of rooms, having a handsome
sitting-room, another next to it for <i>Clock</i> purposes,
a spacious bedroom, and large dressing-room
adjoining. The castle is in front of the windows, and
the view noble. There was a supper ready last night
which would have been a dinner anywhere." This
was his first practical experience of the honors his fame
had won for him, and it found him as eager to receive
as all were eager to give. Very interesting still, too,
are those who took leading part in the celebration;
and in his pleasant sketches of them there are some
once famous and familiar figures not so well known to
the present generation. Here, among the first, are
Wilson and Robertson.</p>

<p>"The renowned Peter Robertson is a large, portly,
full-faced man, with a merry eye, and a queer way of
looking under his spectacles which is characteristic and
pleasant. He seems a very warm-hearted earnest man
too, and I felt quite at home with him forthwith.
Walking up and down the hall of the courts of law
(which was full of advocates, writers to the signet,
clerks, and idlers) was a tall, burly, handsome man
of eight-and-fifty, with a gait like O'Connell's, the
bluest eye you can imagine, and long hair&mdash;longer
than mine&mdash;falling down in a wild way under the
broad brim of his hat. He had on a surtout coat, a
blue checked shirt; the collar standing up, and kept
in its place with a wisp of black neckerchief; no waistcoat;
and a large pocket-handkerchief thrust into his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
breast, which was all broad and open. At his heels
followed a wiry, sharp-eyed, shaggy devil of a terrier,
dogging his steps as he went slashing up and down,
now with one man beside him, now with another, and
now quite alone, but always at a fast, rolling pace, with
his head in the air, and his eyes as wide open as he
could get them. I guessed it was Wilson, and it was.
A bright, clear-complexioned, mountain-looking fellow,
he looks as though he had just come down from the
Highlands, and had never in his life taken pen in hand.
But he has had an attack of paralysis in his right arm,
within this month. He winced when I shook hands
with him; and once or twice, when we were walking
up and down, slipped as if he had stumbled on a piece
of orange-peel. He is a great fellow to look at, and
to talk to; and, if you could divest your mind of the
actual Scott, is just the figure you would put in his
place."</p>

<p>Nor have the most ordinary incidents of the visit
any lack of interest for us now, in so far as they help
to complete the picture of himself: "Allan has been
squiring me about, all the morning. He and Fletcher
have gone to a meeting of the dinner-stewards, and I
take the opportunity of writing to you. They dine
with us to-day, and we are going to-night to the theatre.
M'Ian is playing there. I mean to leave a card for him
before evening. We are engaged for every day of our
stay, already; but the people I have seen are so very
hearty and warm in their manner that much of the
horrors of lionization gives way before it. I am glad to
find that they propose giving me for a toast on Friday
the Memory of Wilkie. I should have liked it better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
than anything, if I could have made my choice. Communicate
all particulars to Mac. I would to God you
were both here. Do dine together at the Gray's Inn
on Friday, and think of me. If I don't drink my first
glass of wine to you, may my pistols miss fire, and my
mare slip her shoulder. All sorts of regard from Kate.
She has gone with Miss Allan to see the house she was
born in, etc. Write me soon, and long, etc."</p>

<p>His next letter was written the morning after the
dinner, on Saturday, the 26th June: "The great event
is over; and, being gone, I am a man again. It was
the most brilliant affair you can conceive; the completest
success possible, from first to last. The room
was crammed, and more than seventy applicants for
tickets were of necessity refused yesterday. Wilson was
ill, but plucked up like a lion, and spoke famously.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
send you a paper herewith, but the report is dismal in
the extreme. They say there will be a better one&mdash;I
don't know where or when. Should there be, I will
send it to you. I <i>think</i> (ahem!) that I spoke rather
well. It was an excellent room, and both the subjects
(Wilson and Scottish Literature, and the Memory of
Wilkie) were good to go upon. There were nearly two
hundred ladies present. The place is so contrived that
the cross table is raised enormously: much above the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
heads of people sitting below: and the effect on first
coming in (on me, I mean) was rather tremendous. I
was quite self-possessed, however, and, notwithstanding
the enthoosemoosy, which was very startling, as cool as
a cucumber. I wish to God you had been there, as it
is impossible for the 'distinguished guest' to describe
the scene. It beat all natur."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Here was the close of his letter: "I have been expecting
every day to hear from you, and not hearing
mean to make this the briefest epistle possible. We
start next Sunday (that's to-morrow week). We are
going out to Jeffrey's to-day (he is very unwell), and
return here to-morrow evening. If I don't find a letter
from you when I come back, expect no Lights and
Shadows of Scottish Life from your indignant correspondent.
Murray the manager made very excellent,
tasteful, and gentlemanly mention of Macready, about
whom Wilson had been asking me divers questions
during dinner." "A hundred thanks for your letter,"
he writes four days later. "I read it this morning
with the greatest pleasure and delight, and answer it
with ditto, ditto. Where shall I begin&mdash;about my
darlings? I am delighted with Charley's precocity.
He takes arter his father, he does. God bless them,
you can't imagine (<i>you!</i> how can you?) how much I
long to see them. It makes me quite sorrowful to
think of them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yesterday, sir, the lord provost,
council, and magistrates voted me by acclamation the
freedom of the city, in testimony (I quote the letter
just received from 'James Forrest, lord provost') 'of
the sense entertained by them of your distinguished
abilities as an author.' I acknowledged this morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in appropriate terms the honor they had done me, and
through me the pursuit to which I was devoted. It <i>is</i>
handsome, is it not?"</p>

<p>The parchment scroll of the city-freedom, recording
the grounds on which it was voted, hung framed in his
study to the last, and was one of his valued possessions.
Answering some question of mine, he told me further
as to the speakers, and gave some amusing glimpses of
the party-spirit which still at that time ran high in the
capital of the north.</p>

<p>"The men who spoke at the dinner were all the most
rising men here, and chiefly at the Bar. They were all,
alternately, Whigs and Tories; with some few Radicals,
such as Gordon, who gave the memory of Burns.
He is Wilson's son-in-law and the lord-advocate's
nephew&mdash;a very masterly speaker indeed, who ought to
become a distinguished man. Neaves, who gave the
other poets, a <i>little</i> too lawyer-like for my taste, is a
great gun in the courts. Mr. Primrose is Lord Rosebery's
son. Adam Black, the publisher as you know.
Dr. Alison, a very popular friend of the poor. Robertson
you know. Allan you know. Colquhoun is an
advocate. All these men were selected for the toasts
as being crack speakers, known men, and opposed to
each other very strongly in politics. For this reason,
the professors and so forth who sat upon the platform
about me made no speeches and had none assigned them.
I felt it was very remarkable to see such a number of
gray-headed men gathered about my brown flowing
locks; and it struck most of those who were present
very forcibly. The judges, solicitor-general, lord-advocate,
and so forth, were all here to call, the day after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
our arrival. The judges never go to public dinners in
Scotland. Lord Meadowbank alone broke through the
custom, and none of his successors have imitated him.
It will give you a good notion of <i>party</i> to hear that the
solicitor-general and lord-advocate refused to go, though
they had previously engaged, <i>unless</i> the croupier or the
chairman were a Whig. Both (Wilson and Robertson)
were Tories, simply because, Jeffrey excepted, no Whig
could be found who was adapted to the office. The
solicitor laid strict injunctions on Napier not to go if
a Whig were not in office. No Whig was, and he
stayed away. I think this is good?&mdash;bearing in mind
that all the old Whigs of Edinburgh were cracking
their throats in the room. They gave out that they
were ill, and the lord-advocate did actually lie in bed
all the afternoon; but this is the real truth, and one of
the judges told it me with great glee. It seems they
couldn't quite trust Wilson or Robertson, as they
thought; and feared some Tory demonstration. Nothing
of the kind took place; and ever since, these
men have been the loudest in their praises of the whole
affair."</p>

<p>The close of his letter tells us all his engagements,
and completes his graceful picture of the hearty Scottish
welcome given him. It has also some personal
touches that may be thought worth preserving. "A
threat reached me last night (they have been hammering
at it in their papers, it seems, for some time) of a
dinner at Glasgow. But I hope, having circulated false
rumors of my movements, to get away before they send
to me; and only to stop there on my way home, to
change horses and send to the post-office.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
will like to know how we have been living. Here's a
list of engagements, past and present. Wednesday,
we dined at home, and went incog. to the theatre at
night, to Murray's box; the pieces admirably done,
and M'Ian in the <i>Two Drovers</i> quite wonderful and
most affecting. Thursday, to Lord Murray's; dinner
and evening party. Friday, <i>the</i> dinner. Saturday, to
Jeffrey's, a beautiful place about three miles off" (Craigcrook,
which at Lord Jeffrey's invitation I afterwards
visited with him), "stop there all night, dine on
Sunday, and home at eleven. Monday, dine at Dr.
Alison's, four miles off. Tuesday, dinner and evening
party at Allan's. Wednesday, breakfast with Napier,
dine with Blackwood's seven miles off, evening party at
the treasurer's of the town-council, supper with all the
artists (!!). Thursday, lunch at the solicitor-general's,
dine at Lord Gillies's, evening party at Joseph Gordon's,
one of Brougham's earliest supporters. Friday, dinner
and evening party at Robertson's. Saturday, dine
again at Jeffrey's; back to the theatre, at half-past nine
to the moment, for public appearance;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> places all let,
etc. etc. etc. Sunday, off at seven o'clock in the morning
to Stirling, and then to Callender, a stage further.
Next day, to Loch Earn, and pull up there for three
days, to rest and work. The moral of all this is, that
there is no place like home; and that I thank God most
heartily for having given me a quiet spirit, and a heart
that won't hold many people. I sigh for Devonshire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Terrace and Broadstairs, for battledoor and shuttlecock;
I want to dine in a blouse with you and Mac; and I
feel Topping's merits more acutely than I have ever
done in my life. On Sunday evening, the 17th of July,
I shall revisit my household gods, please Heaven. I
wish the day were here. For God's sake be in waiting.
I wish you and Mac would dine in Devonshire Terrace
that day with Fred. He has the key of the cellar. <i>Do.</i>
We shall be at Inverary in the Highlands on Tuesday
week, getting to it through the Pass of Glencoe, of
which you may have heard! On Thursday following
we shall be at Glasgow, where I shall hope to receive
your last letter before we meet. At Inverary, too, I
shall make sure of finding at least one, at the post-office.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Little Allan is trying hard for the post of
queen's limner for Scotland, vacant by poor Wilkie's
death. Every one is in his favor but &mdash;&mdash;, who is jobbing
for some one else. Appoint him, will you, and
I'll give up the premiership.&mdash;How I breakfasted to-day
in the house where Scott lived seven-and-twenty
years; how I have made solemn pledges to write about
missing children in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, and will do
my best to keep them; how I have declined to be
brought in, free gratis for nothing and qualified to boot,
for a Scotch county that's going a-begging, lest I should
be thought to have dined on Friday under false pretenses;
these, with other marvels, shall be yours anon.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I must leave off sharp, to get dressed and off
upon the seven miles' dinner-trip. Kate's affectionate
regards. My hearty loves to Mac and Grim." Grim
was another great artist having the same beginning
to his name, whose tragic studies had suggested an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
epithet quite inapplicable to any of his personal qualities.</p>

<p>The narrative of the trip to the Highlands must have
a chapter to itself and its incidents of adventure and
comedy. The latter chiefly were due to the guide who
accompanied him, a quasi-Highlander himself, named
a few pages back as Mr. Kindheart, whose real name
was Mr. Angus Fletcher, and to whom it hardly needs
that I should give other mention than will be supplied
by such future notices of him as my friend's letters may
contain. He had a wayward kind of talent, which he
could never concentrate on a settled pursuit; and
though at the time we knew him first he had taken up
the profession of a sculptor, he abandoned it soon afterwards.
His mother, a woman distinguished by many
remarkable qualities, lived now in the English lake-country;
and it was no fault of hers that this home was
no longer her son's. But what mainly had closed it to
him was undoubtedly not less the secret of such liking
for him as Dickens had. Fletcher's eccentricities and
absurdities, often divided by the thinnest partition from
the most foolish extravagance, but occasionally clever,
and always the genuine though whimsical outgrowth
of the life he led, had a curious sort of charm for
Dickens. He enjoyed the oddity and humor; tolerated
all the rest; and to none more freely than to Kindheart
during the next few years, both in Italy and in England,
opened his house and hospitality. The close of the
poor fellow's life, alas! was in only too sad agreement
with all the previous course of it; but this will have
mention hereafter. He is waiting now to introduce
Dickens to the Highlands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Loch Earn Head Dickens wrote on Monday,
the 5th of July, having reached it, "wet through," at
four that afternoon: "Having had a great deal to do
in a crowded house on Saturday night at the theatre, we
left Edinburgh yesterday morning at half-past seven,
and traveled, with Fletcher for our guide, to a place
called Stewart's Hotel, nine miles further than Callender.
We had neglected to order rooms, and were
obliged to make a sitting-room of our own bed-chamber;
in which my genius for stowing furniture away
was of the very greatest service. Fletcher slept in a
kennel with three panes of glass in it, which formed
part and parcel of a window; the other three panes
whereof belonged to a man who slept on the other side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of the partition. He told me this morning that he had
had a nightmare all night, and had screamed horribly,
he knew. The stranger, as you may suppose, hired a
gig and went off at full gallop with the first glimpse
of daylight.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Being very tired (for we had not had
more than three hours' sleep on the previous night) we
lay till ten this morning, and at half-past eleven went
through the Trossachs to Loch Katrine, where I walked
from the hotel after tea last night. It is impossible to
say what a glorious scene it was. It rained as it never
does rain anywhere but here. We conveyed Kate up
a rocky pass to go and see the island of the Lady of the
Lake, but she gave in after the first five minutes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
we left her, very picturesque and uncomfortable, with
Tom" (the servant they had brought with them from
Devonshire Terrace) "holding an umbrella over her
head, while we climbed on. When we came back, she
had gone into the carriage. We were wet through to
the skin, and came on in that state four-and-twenty
miles. Fletcher is very good-natured, and of extraordinary
use in these outlandish parts. His habit of going
into kitchens and bars, disconcerting at Broadstairs, is
here of great service. Not expecting us till six, they
hadn't lighted our fires when we arrived here; and if
you had seen him (with whom the responsibility of the
omission rested) running in and out of the sitting-room
and the two bedrooms with a great pair of bellows, with
which he distractedly blew each of the fires out in turn,
you would have died of laughing. He had on his head
a great Highland cap, on his back a white coat, and cut
such a figure as even the inimitable can't depicter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"The inns, inside and out, are the queerest places
imaginable. From the road, this one," at Loch Earn
Head, "looks like a white wall, with windows in it
by mistake. We have a good sitting-room, though, on
the first floor: as large (but not as lofty) as my study.
The bedrooms are of that size which renders it impossible
for you to move, after you have taken your boots
off, without chipping pieces out of your legs. There
isn't a basin in the Highlands which will hold my face;
not a drawer which will open, after you have put your
clothes in it; not a water-bottle capacious enough to
wet your toothbrush. The huts are wretched and miserable
beyond all description. The food (for those
who can pay for it) 'not bad,' as M. would say: oat-cake,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
mutton, hotch-potch, trout from the loch, small
beer bottled, marmalade, and whiskey. Of the last-named
article I have taken about a pint to-day. The
weather is what they call 'soft'&mdash;which means that the
sky is a vast water-spout that never leaves off emptying
itself; and the liquor has no more effect than water.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
am going to work to-morrow, and hope before
leaving here to write you again. The elections have
been sad work indeed. That they should return Sibthorp
and reject Bulwer, is, by Heaven, a national
disgrace.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don't wonder the devil flew over Lincoln.
The people were far too addle-headed, even for
him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don't bore you with accounts of Ben this
and that, and Lochs of all sorts of names, but this is a
wonderful region. The way the mists were stalking
about to-day, and the clouds lying down upon the
hills; the deep glens, the high rocks, the rushing waterfalls,
and the roaring rivers down in deep gulfs below;
were all stupendous. This house is wedged round by
great heights that are lost in the clouds; and the loch,
twelve miles long, stretches out its dreary length before
the windows. In my next I shall soar to the
sublime, perhaps; in this here present writing I confine
myself to the ridiculous. But I am always," etc. etc.</p>

<p>His next letter bore the date of "Ballechelish,
Friday evening, ninth July, 1841, half-past nine, <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,"
and described what we had often longed to see together,
the Pass of Glencoe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "I can't go to bed without
writing to you from here, though the post will not
leave this place until we have left it and arrived at another.
On looking over the route which Lord Murray
made out for me, I found he had put down Thursday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
next for Abbotsford and Dryburgh Abbey, and a journey
of seventy miles besides! Therefore, and as I
was happily able to steal a march upon myself at Loch
Earn Head, and to finish in two days what I thought
would take me three, we shall leave here to-morrow
morning; and, by being a day earlier than we intended
at all the places between this and Melrose (which we
propose to reach by Wednesday night), we shall have a
whole day for Scott's house and tomb, and still be at
York on Saturday evening, and home, God willing, on
Sunday.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We left Loch Earn Head last night, and
went to a place called Killin, eight miles from it,
where we slept. I walked some six miles with Fletcher
after we got there, to see a waterfall; and truly it was
a magnificent sight, foaming and crashing down three
great steeps of riven rock; leaping over the first as far
off as you could carry your eye, and rumbling and
foaming down into a dizzy pool below you, with a
deafening roar. To-day we have had a journey of between
50 and 60 miles, through the bleakest and most
desolate part of Scotland, where the hill-tops are still
covered with great patches of snow, and the road winds
over steep mountain-passes, and on the brink of deep
brooks and precipices. The cold all day has been
<i>intense</i>, and the rain sometimes most violent. It has
been impossible to keep warm, by any means; even
whiskey failed; the wind was too piercing even for
that. One stage of ten miles, over a place called the
Black Mount, took us two hours and a half to do; and
when we came to a lone public called the King's
House, at the entrance to Glencoe,&mdash;this was about
three o'clock,&mdash;we were wellnigh frozen. We got a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
fire directly, and in twenty minutes they served us up
some famous kippered salmon, broiled; a broiled fowl;
hot mutton ham and poached eggs; pancakes; oat-cake;
wheaten bread; butter; bottled porter; hot
water, lump sugar, and whiskey; of which we made a
very hearty meal. All the way, the road had been
among moors and mountains, with huge masses of rock,
which fell down God knows where, sprinkling the
ground in every direction, and giving it the aspect
of the burial-place of a race of giants. Now and then
we passed a hut or two, with neither window nor chimney,
and the smoke of the peat fire rolling out at the
door. But there were not six of these dwellings in a
dozen miles; and anything so bleak and wild, and
mighty in its loneliness, as the whole country, it is impossible
to conceive. Glencoe itself is perfectly <i>terrible</i>.
The pass is an awful place. It is shut in on each
side by enormous rocks from which great torrents come
rushing down in all directions. In amongst these rocks
on one side of the pass (the left as we came) there are
scores of glens, high up, which form such haunts as
you might imagine yourself wandering in, in the very
height and madness of a fever. They will live in my
dreams for years&mdash;I was going to say as long as I live,
and I seriously think so. The very recollection of
them makes me shudder.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, I will not bore
you with my impressions of these tremendous wilds,
but they really are fearful in their grandeur and
amazing solitude. Wales is a mere toy compared with
them."</p>

<p>The further mention of his guide's whimsical ways
may stand, for it cannot now be the possible occasion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of pain or annoyance, or of anything but very innocent
laughter:</p>

<p>"We are now in a bare white house on the banks of
Loch Leven, but in a comfortably-furnished room on
the top of the house,&mdash;that is, on the first floor,&mdash;with
the rain pattering against the window as though
it were December, the wind howling dismally, a cold
damp mist on everything without, a blazing fire within
half way up the chimney, and a most infernal Piper
practicing under the window for a competition of pipers
which is to come off shortly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The store of anecdotes
of Fletcher with which we shall return will last a
long time. It seems that the F.'s are an extensive clan,
and that his father was a Highlander. Accordingly,
wherever he goes, he finds out some cotter or small
farmer who is his cousin. I wish you could see him
walking into his cousins' curds and cream, and into their
dairies generally! Yesterday morning, between eight
and nine, I was sitting writing at the open window,
when the postman came to the inn (which at Loch Earn
Head is the post-office) for the letters. He is going
away, when Fletcher, who has been writing somewhere
below-stairs, rushes out, and cries, 'Halloa there! Is
that the Post?' 'Yes!' somebody answers. 'Call him
back!' says Fletcher: 'Just sit down till I've done, <i>and
don't go away till I tell you</i>.'&mdash;Fancy! The General
Post, with the letters of forty villages in a leathern bag!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
To-morrow at Oban. Sunday at Inverary.
Monday at Tarbet. Tuesday at Glasgow (and that night
at Hamilton). Wednesday at Melrose. Thursday at
ditto. Friday I don't know where. Saturday at York.
Sunday&mdash;how glad I shall be to shake hands with you!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
My love to Mac. I thought he'd have written once.
Ditto to Macready. I had a very nice and welcome
letter from him, and a most hearty one from Elliotson.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
P.S. Half asleep. So excuse drowsiness of matter
and composition. I shall be full of joy to meet another
letter from you!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. P.P.S. They speak Gaelic here,
of course, and many of the common people understand
very little English. Since I wrote this letter, I rang
the girl up-stairs, and gave elaborate directions (you
know my way) for a pint of sherry to be made into
boiling negus; mentioning all the ingredients one by
one, and particularly nutmeg. When I had quite finished,
seeing her obviously bewildered, I said, with
great gravity, 'Now you know what you're going to
order?' 'Oh, yes. Sure.' 'What?'&mdash;a pause&mdash;'Just'&mdash;another
pause&mdash;'Just plenty of <i>nutbergs!</i>'"</p>

<p>The impression made upon him by the Pass of Glencoe
was not overstated in this letter. It continued with
him as he there expressed it; and as we shall see hereafter,
even where he expected to find Nature in her
most desolate grandeur on the dreary waste of an American
prairie, his imagination went back with a higher
satisfaction to Glencoe. But his experience of it is not
yet completely told. The sequel was in a letter of two
days' later date, from "Dalmally, Sunday, July the
eleventh, 1841:"</p>

<p>"As there was no place of this name in our route, you
will be surprised to see it at the head of this present
writing. But our being here is a part of such moving
accidents by flood and field as will astonish you. If you
should happen to have your hat on, take it off, that your
hair may stand on end without any interruption. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
get from Ballyhoolish (as I am obliged to spell it when
Fletcher is not in the way; and he is out at this moment)
to Oban, it is necessary to cross two ferries, one of which
is an arm of the sea, eight or ten miles broad. Into this
ferry-boat, passengers, carriages, horses, and all, get
bodily, and are got across by hook or by crook if the
weather be reasonably fine. Yesterday morning, however,
it blew such a strong gale that the landlord of the
inn, where we had paid for horses all the way to Oban
(thirty miles), honestly came up-stairs just as we were
starting, with the money in his hand, and told us it
would be impossible to cross. There was nothing to
be done but to come back five-and-thirty miles, through
Glencoe and Inverouran, to a place called Tyndrum,
whence a road twelve miles long crosses to Dalmally,
which is sixteen miles from Inverary. Accordingly we
turned back, and in a great storm of wind and rain
began to retrace the dreary road we had come the day
before.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was not at all ill pleased to have to come
again through that awful Glencoe. If it had been tremendous
on the previous day, yesterday it was perfectly
horrific. It had rained all night, and was raining then,
as it only does in these parts. Through the whole
glen, which is ten miles long, torrents were boiling and
foaming, and sending up in every direction spray like
the smoke of great fires. They were rushing down
every hill and mountain side, and tearing like devils
across the path, and down into the depths of the
rocks. Some of the hills looked as if they were full of
silver, and had cracked in a hundred places. Others
as if they were frightened, and had broken out into a
deadly sweat. In others there was no compromise or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
division of streams, but one great torrent came roaring
down with a deafening noise, and a rushing of water
that was quite appalling. Such a <i>spaet</i>, in short (that's
the country word), has not been known for many years,
and the sights and sounds were beyond description.
The post-boy was not at all at his ease, and the horses
were very much frightened (as well they might be) by
the perpetual raging and roaring; one of them started
as we came down a steep place, and we were within
that much (&mdash;&mdash;) of tumbling over a precipice; just
then, too, the drag broke, and we were obliged to go
on as we best could, without it: getting out every now
and then, and hanging on at the back of the carriage
to prevent its rolling down too fast, and going Heaven
knows where. Well, in this pleasant state of things
we came to King's House again, having been four
hours doing the sixteen miles. The rumble where
Tom sat was by this time so full of water that he was
obliged to borrow a gimlet and bore holes in the bottom
to let it run out. The horses that were to take us on
were out upon the hills, somewhere within ten miles
round; and three or four bare-legged fellows went out
to look for 'em, while we sat by the fire and tried to
dry ourselves. At last we got off again (without the
drag and with a broken spring, no smith living within
ten miles), and went limping on to Inverouran. In the
first three miles we were in a ditch and out again, and
lost a horse's shoe. All this time it never once left off
raining; and was very windy, very cold, very misty,
and most intensely dismal. So we crossed the Black
Mount, and came to a place we had passed the day
before, where a rapid river runs over a bed of broken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
rock. Now, this river, sir, had a bridge last winter,
but the bridge broke down when the thaw came, and
has never since been mended; so travelers cross upon
a little platform, made of rough deal planks stretching
from rock to rock; and carriages and horses ford the
water, at a certain point. As the platform is the reverse
of steady (we had proved this the day before), is very
slippery, and affords anything but a pleasant footing,
having only a trembling little rail on one side, and on
the other nothing between it and the foaming stream,
Kate decided to remain in the carriage, and trust herself
to the wheels rather than to her feet. Fletcher and
I had got out, and it was going away, when I advised
her, as I had done several times before, to come with
us; for I saw that the water was very high, the current
being greatly swollen by the rain, and that the post-boy
had been eyeing it in a very disconcerted manner for
the last half-hour. This decided her to come out; and
Fletcher, she, Tom, and I, began to cross, while the
carriage went about a quarter of a mile down the bank,
in search of a shallow place. The platform shook so
much that we could only come across two at a time,
and then it felt as if it were hung on springs. As to
the wind and rain! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, put into one gust all
the wind and rain you ever saw and heard, and you'll
have some faint notion of it! When we got safely to
the opposite bank, there came riding up a wild Highlander,
in a great plaid, whom we recognized as the
landlord of the inn, and who, without taking the
least notice of us, went dashing on,&mdash;with the plaid
he was wrapped in, streaming in the wind,&mdash;screeching
in Gaelic to the post-boy on the opposite bank,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and making the most frantic gestures you ever saw, in
which he was joined by some other wild man on foot,
who had come across by a short cut, knee-deep in mire
and water. As we began to see what this meant, we
(that is, Fletcher and I) scrambled on after them, while
the boy, horses, and carriage were plunging in the
water, which left only the horses' heads and the boy's
body visible. By the time we got up to them, the man
on horseback and the men on foot were perfectly mad
with pantomime; for as to any of their shouts being
heard by the boy, the water made such a great noise
that they might as well have been dumb. It made me
quite sick to think how I should have felt if Kate had
been inside. The carriage went round and round like
a great stone, the boy was as pale as death, the horses
were struggling and plashing and snorting like sea-animals,
and we were all roaring to the driver to throw
himself off and let them and the coach go to the devil,
when suddenly it came all right (having got into shallow
water), and, all tumbling and dripping and jogging
from side to side, climbed up to the dry land. I assure
you we looked rather queer, as we wiped our faces
and stared at each other in a little cluster round about
it. It seemed that the man on horseback had been
looking at us through a telescope as we came to the
track, and knowing that the place was very dangerous,
and seeing that we meant to bring the carriage, had come
on at a great gallop to show the driver the only place
where he could cross. By the time he came up, the man
had taken the water at a wrong place, and in a word
was as nearly drowned (with carriage, horses, luggage,
and all) as ever man was. Was <i>this</i> a good adventure?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"We all went on to the inn,&mdash;the wild man galloping
on first, to get a fire lighted,&mdash;and there we dined
on eggs and bacon, oat-cake, and whiskey; and changed
and dried ourselves. The place was a mere knot of little
outhouses, and in one of these there were fifty Highlanders
<i>all drunk</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some were drovers, some pipers,
and some workmen engaged to build a hunting-lodge
for Lord Breadalbane hard by, who had been driven in
by stress of weather. One was a paper-hanger. He
had come out three days before to paper the inn's best
room, a chamber almost large enough to keep a Newfoundland
dog in, and, from the first half-hour after
his arrival to that moment, had been hopelessly and
irreclaimably drunk. They were lying about in all
directions: on forms, on the ground, about a loft overhead,
round the turf-fire wrapped in plaids, on the
tables, and under them. We paid our bill, thanked our
host very heartily, gave some money to his children,
and after an hour's rest came on again. At ten o'clock
at night we reached this place, and were overjoyed to
find quite an English inn, with good beds (those we
have slept on, yet, have always been of straw), and
every possible comfort. We breakfasted this morning
at half-past ten, and at three go on to Inverary to dinner.
I believe the very rough part of the journey is
over, and I am really glad of it. Kate sends all kind
of regards. I shall hope to find a letter from you at
Inverary when the post reaches there, to-morrow. I
wrote to Oban yesterday, desiring the post-office keeper
to send any he might have for us, over to that place.
Love to Mac."</p>

<p>One more letter, brief, but overflowing at every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
word with his generous nature, must close the delightful
series written from Scotland. It was dated from
Inverary the day following his exciting adventure;
promised me another from Melrose (which has unfortunately
not been kept with the rest); and inclosed
the invitation to a public dinner at Glasgow. "I have
returned for answer that I am on my way home, on
pressing business connected with my weekly publication,
and can't stop. But I have offered to come down
any day in September or October, and accept the honor
then. Now, I shall come and return per mail; and, if
this suits them, enter into a solemn league and covenant
to come with me. <i>Do.</i> You must. I am sure
you will.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Till my next, and always afterwards,
God bless you. I got your welcome letter this morning,
and have read it a hundred times. What a pleasure
it is! Kate's best regards. I am dying for Sunday,
and wouldn't stop now for twenty dinners of twenty
thousand each.</p>

<h3>AGAIN AT BROADSTAIRS.</h3>

<h3>1841.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">Peel and his Party&mdash;Getting very Radical&mdash;Thoughts of colonizing&mdash;Political
Squib by C. D.&mdash;Fine Old English Tory Times&mdash;Mesmerism&mdash;Metropolitan

<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after his return, at the opening of August, he
went to Broadstairs; and the direction in which that
last question shows his thoughts to have been busy
was that to which he turned his first holiday leisure.
He sent me some rhymed squibs as his anonymous contribution
to the fight the Liberals were then making
against what was believed to be intended by the return
to office of the Tories; ignorant as we were how much
wiser than his party the statesman then at the head of
it was, or how greatly what we all most desired would
be advanced by the very success that had been most
disheartening. There will be no harm now in giving
one of these pieces, which will sufficiently show the
tone of all of them, and with what a hearty relish
they were written. I doubt indeed if he ever enjoyed
anything more than the power of thus taking part
occasionally, unknown to outsiders, in the sharp conflict<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the press was waging at the time. "By Jove, how
radical I am getting!" he wrote to me (13th August).
"I wax stronger and stronger in the true principles
every day. I don't know whether it's the sea, or no,
but so it is." He would at times even talk, in moments
of sudden indignation at the political outlook, of carrying
off himself and his household gods, like Coriolanus,
to a world elsewhere! "Thank God there is a Van
Diemen's Land. That's my comfort. Now, I wonder
if I should make a good settler! I wonder, if I went
to a new colony with my head, hands, legs, and health,
I should force myself to the top of the social milk-pot
and live upon the cream! What do you think? Upon
my word, I believe I should."</p>

<p>His political squibs during the Tory interregnum
comprised some capital subjects for pictures after the
manner of Peter Pindar; but that which I select has no
touch of personal satire in it, and he would himself, for
that reason, have least objected to its revival. Thus
ran his new version of "The Fine Old English Gentleman,
to be said or sung at all conservative dinners:"</p>

<div class='poem2'><br />
I'll sing you a new ballad, and I'll warrant it first-rate,<br />
Of the days of that old gentleman who had that old estate;<br />
When they spent the public money at a bountiful old rate<br />
On ev'ry mistress, pimp, and scamp, at ev'ry noble gate.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">In the fine old English Tory times;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">Soon may they come again!</span><br />
<br />
The good old laws were garnished well with gibbets, whips, and chains,<br />
With fine old English penalties, and fine old English pains,<br />
With rebel heads and seas of blood once hot in rebel veins;<br />
For all these things were requisite to guard the rich old gains<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">Of the fine old English Tory times;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">Soon may they come again!</span><br />
<br />
This brave old code, like Argus, had a hundred watchful eyes,<br />
And ev'ry English peasant had his good old English spies,<br />
To tempt his starving discontent with fine old English lies,<br />
Then call the good old Yeomanry to stop his peevish cries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">In the fine old English Tory times;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">Soon may they come again!</span><br />
<br />
The good old times for cutting throats that cried out in their need,<br />
The good old times for hunting men who held their fathers' creed,<br />
The good old times when William Pitt, as all good men agreed,<br />
Came down direct from Paradise at more than railroad speed. . . .<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">Oh, the fine old English Tory times;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">When will they come again?</span><br />
<br />
In those rare days, the press was seldom known to snarl or bark,<br />
But sweetly sang of men in pow'r, like any tuneful lark;<br />
Grave judges, too, to all their evil deeds were in the dark;<br />
And not a man in twenty score knew how to make his mark.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">Oh, the fine old English Tory times;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">Soon may they come again! . . .</span><br />
<br />
But tolerance, though slow in flight, is strong-wing'd in the main;<br />
That night must come on these fine days, in course of time was plain;<br />
The pure old spirit struggled, but its struggles were in vain;<br />
A nation's grip was on it, and it died in choking pain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">With the fine old English Tory days,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">All of the olden time.</span><br />
<br />
The bright old day now dawns again; the cry runs through the land,<br />
In England there shall be&mdash;dear bread! in Ireland&mdash;sword and brand!<br />
And poverty, and ignorance, shall swell the rich and grand,<br />
So, rally round the rulers with the gentle iron hand<br />

</div>

<p>Of matters in which he had been specially interested
before he quitted London, one or two may properly be
named. He had always sympathized, almost as strongly
as Archbishop Whately did, with Dr. Elliotson's mesmeric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
investigations; and, reinforced as these were in
the present year by the displays of a Belgian youth
whom another friend, Mr. Chauncy Hare Townshend,
brought over to England, the subject, which to the last
had an attraction for him, was for the time rather
ardently followed up. The improvement during the
last few years in the London prisons was another matter
of eager and pleased inquiry with him; and he took
frequent means of stating what in this respect had been
done, since even the date when his <i>Sketches</i> were written,
by two most efficient public officers at Clerkenwell and
Tothill Fields, Mr. Chesterton and Lieutenant Tracey,
whom the course of these inquiries turned into private
friends. His last letter to me before he quitted town
sufficiently explains itself. "Slow rises worth by poverty
deprest" was the thought in his mind at every part
of his career, and he never for a moment was unmindful
of the duty it imposed upon him: "I subscribed for
a couple of copies" (31st July) "of this little book.
I knew nothing of the man, but he wrote me a very
modest letter of two lines, some weeks ago. I have been
much affected by the little biography at the beginning,
and I thought you would like to share the emotion it
had raised in me. I wish we were all in Eden again&mdash;for
the sake of these toiling creatures."</p>

<p>In the middle of August (Monday, 16th) I had announcement
that he was coming up for special purposes:
"I sit down to write to you without an atom of news
to communicate. Yes, I have,&mdash;something that will
surprise you, who are pent up in dark and dismal Lincoln's
Inn Fields. It is the brightest day you ever saw.
The sun is sparkling on the water so that I can hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
bear to look at it. The tide is in, and the fishing-boats
are dancing like mad. Upon the green-topped
cliffs the corn is cut and piled in shocks; and thousands
of butterflies are fluttering about, taking the
bright little red flags at the mast-heads for flowers, and
panting with delight accordingly. [Here the Inimitable,
unable to resist the brilliancy out of doors, breaketh
off, rusheth to the machines, and plungeth into
the sea. Returning, he proceedeth:] Jeffrey is just
as he was when he wrote the letter I sent you. No
better, and no worse. I had a letter from Napier on
Saturday, urging the children's-labor subject upon me.
But, as I hear from Southwood Smith that the report
cannot be printed until the new Parliament has sat at
the least six weeks, it will be impossible to produce
it before the January number. I shall be in town on
Saturday morning and go straight to you. A letter
has come from little Hall begging that when I <i>do</i> come
to town I will dine there, as they wish to talk about
the new story. I have written to say that I will do so
on Saturday, and we will go together; but I shall be
by no means good company.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have more than
half a mind to start a bookseller of my own. I could;
with good capital too, as you know; and ready to spend
it. <i>G. Varden beware!</i>"</p>

<p>Small causes of displeasure had been growing out of
the <i>Clock</i>, and were almost unavoidably incident to the
position in which he found himself respecting it. Its
discontinuance had become necessary, the strain upon
himself being too great without the help from others
which experience had shown to be impracticable; but I
thought he had not met the difficulty wisely by undertaking,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
which already he had done, to begin a new
story so early as the following March. On his arrival,
therefore, we decided on another plan, with which we
went armed that Saturday afternoon to his publishers,
and of which the result will be best told by himself. He
had returned to Broadstairs the following morning, and
next day (Monday, the 23d of August) he wrote to me
in very enthusiastic terms of the share I had taken in
what he calls "the development on Saturday afternoon;
when I thought Chapman very manly and sensible, Hall
morally and physically feeble though perfectly well intentioned,
and both the statement and reception of the
project quite triumphant. Didn't you think so too?"
A fortnight later, Tuesday, the 7th of September, the
agreement was signed in my chambers, and its terms
were to the effect following. The <i>Clock</i> was to cease
with the close of <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>, the respective ownerships
continuing as provided; and the new work in
twenty numbers, similar to those of <i>Pickwick</i> and <i>Nickleby</i>,
was not to begin until after an interval of twelve
months, in November, 1842. During its publication
he was to receive two hundred pounds monthly, to be
accounted as part of the expenses; for all which, and
all risks incident, the publishers made themselves responsible,
under conditions the same as in the <i>Clock</i>
agreement; except that out of the profits of each number
they were to have only a fourth, three-fourths going
to him, and this arrangement was to hold good until
the termination of six months from the completed book,
when, upon payment to him of a fourth of the value of
all existing stock, they were to have half the future interest.
During the twelve months' interval before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
book began, he was to be paid one hundred and fifty
pounds each month; but this was to be drawn from his
three-fourths of the profits, and in no way to interfere
with the monthly payments of two hundred pounds
while the publication was going on.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Such was the
"project," excepting only a provision to be mentioned
hereafter against the improbable event of the profits
being inadequate to the repayment; and my only drawback
from the satisfaction of my own share in it arose
from my fear of the use he was likely to make of the
leisure it afforded him.</p>

<p>That this fear was not ill founded appeared at the close
of the next note I had from him: "There's no news"
(13th September) "since my last. We are going to dine
with Rogers to-day, and with Lady Essex, who is also
here. Rogers is much pleased with Lord Ashley, who
was offered by Peel a post in the government, but resolutely
refused to take office unless Peel pledged himself
to factory-improvement. Peel 'hadn't made up his
mind,' and Lord Ashley was deaf to all other inducements,
though they must have been very tempting.
Much do I honor him for it. I am in an exquisitely
lazy state, bathing, walking, reading, lying in the sun,
doing everything but working. This frame of mind is
superinduced by the prospect of rest, and the promising
arrangements which I owe to you. I am still haunted
by visions of America night and day. To miss this
opportunity would be a sad thing. Kate cries dismally
if I mention the subject. But, God willing, I think it
<i>must</i> be managed somehow!"</p>

<h3>EVE OF THE VISIT TO AMERICA.</h3>

<h3>1841.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">Greetings from America&mdash;Reply to Washington Irving&mdash;Difficulties
in the Way&mdash;Resolve to go&mdash;Wish to revisit Scenes of Boyhood&mdash;Proposed
Book of Travel&mdash;Arrangements for the Journey&mdash;Impatience

Travelers.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> notion of America was in his mind, as we have
seen, when he first projected the <i>Clock;</i> and a very
hearty letter from Washington Irving about Little Nell
and the <i>Curiosity Shop</i>, expressing the delight with his
writings and the yearnings to himself which had indeed
been pouring in upon him for some time from every part
of the States, had very strongly revived it. He answered
Irving with more than his own warmth: unable
to thank him enough for his cordial and generous praise,
or to tell him what lasting gratification it had given.
"I wish I could find in your welcome letter," he added,
"some hint of an intention to visit England. I should
love to go with you, as I have gone, God knows how
often, into Little Britain, and Eastcheap, and Green
Arbor Court, and Westminster Abbey.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It would
gladden my heart to compare notes with you about all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
those delightful places and people that I used to walk
about and dream of in the daytime, when a very small
and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy." After
interchange of these letters the subject was frequently
revived; upon his return from Scotland it began to
take shape as a thing that somehow or other, at no
very distant date, <i>must be;</i> and at last, near the end
of a letter filled with many unimportant things, the
announcement, doubly underlined, came to me.</p>

<p>The decision once taken, he was in his usual fever
until its difficulties were disposed of. The objections
to separation from the children led at first to the notion
of taking them, but this was as quickly abandoned;
and what remained to be overcome yielded readily to
the kind offices of Macready, the offer of whose home
to the little ones during the time of absence, though
not accepted to the full extent, gave yet the assurance
needed to quiet natural apprehensions. All this, including
an arrangement for publication of such notes as
might occur to him on the journey, took but a few days;
and I was reading in my chambers a letter he had written
the previous day from Broadstairs, when a note from
him reached me, written that morning in London, to
tell me he was on his way to take share of my breakfast.
He had come overland by Canterbury after posting
his first letter, had seen Macready the previous
night, and had completed some part of the arrangements.
This mode of rapid procedure was characteristic
of him at all similar times, and will appear in the
few following extracts from his letters:</p>

<p>"Now" (19th September) "to astonish you. After
balancing, considering, and weighing the matter in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
every point of view, <span class="smcap">I have made up my mind (with
God's leave) to go to America&mdash;and to start as
soon after Christmas as it will be safe to go.</span>"
Further information was promised immediately; and a
request followed, characteristic as any he could have
added to his design of traveling so far away, that we
should visit once more together the scenes of his boyhood.
"On the ninth of October we leave here. It's
a Saturday. If it should be fine dry weather, or anything
like it, will you meet us at Rochester, and stop
there two or three days to see all the lions in the surrounding
country? Think of this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If you'll arrange
to come, I'll have the carriage down, and Topping;
and, supposing news from Glasgow don't interfere with
us, which I fervently hope it will not, I will insure that
we have much enjoyment."</p>

<p>Three days later than that which announced his
resolve, the subject was resumed: "I wrote to Chapman
&amp; Hall asking them what they thought of it, and
saying I meant to keep a note-book, and publish it for
half a guinea or thereabouts, on my return. They
instantly sent the warmest possible reply, and said they
had taken it for granted I would go, and had been
speaking of it only the day before. I have begged
them to make every inquiry about the fares, cabins,
berths, and times of sailing; and I shall make a great
effort to take Kate <i>and</i> the children. In that case I
shall try to let the house furnished, for six months (for
I shall remain that time in America); and if I succeed,
the rent will nearly pay the expenses out, and home.
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word omitted in original">I</ins> have heard of family cabins at &pound;100; and I think one
of these is large enough to hold us all. A single fare,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
I think, is forty guineas. I fear I could not be happy
if we had the Atlantic between us; but leaving them
in New York while I ran off a thousand miles or so,
would be quite another thing. If I can arrange all my
plans before publishing the <i>Clock</i> address, I shall state
therein that I am going: which will be no unimportant
consideration, as affording the best possible reason for
a long delay. How I am to get on without you for
seven or eight months, I cannot, upon my soul, conceive.
I dread to think of breaking up all our old
happy habits for so long a time. The advantages of
going, however, appear by steady looking-at so great,
that I have come to persuade myself it is a matter of
imperative necessity. Kate weeps whenever it is spoken
of. Washington Irving has got a nasty low fever. I
heard from him a day or two ago."</p>

<p>His next letter was the unexpected arrival which
came by hand from Devonshire Terrace, when I thought
him still by the sea: "This is to give you notice that
I am coming to breakfast with you this morning on my
way to Broadstairs. I repeat it, sir,&mdash;on my way <i>to</i>
Broadstairs. For, directly I got Macready's note yesterday
I went to Canterbury, and came on by day-coach
for the express purpose of talking with him;
which I did between 11 and 12 last night in Clarence
Terrace. The American preliminaries are necessarily
startling, and, to a gentleman of my temperament, destroy
rest, sleep, appetite, and work, unless definitely
arranged.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Macready has quite decided me in respect
of time and so forth. The instant I have wrung a reluctant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
consent from Kate, I shall take our joint passage
in the mail-packet for next January. I never loved my
friends so well as now." We had all discountenanced
his first thought of taking the children; and, upon this
and other points, the experience of our friend who had
himself traveled over the States was very valuable. His
next letter, two days later from Broadstairs, informed
me of the result of the Macready conference: "Only
a word. Kate is quite reconciled. 'Anne' (her maid)
goes, and is amazingly cheerful and light of heart upon
it. And I think, at present, that it's a greater trial to
me than anybody. The 4th of January is the day.
Macready's note to Kate was received and acted upon
with a perfect response. She talks about it quite gayly,
and is satisfied to have nobody in the house but Fred,
of whom, as you know, they are all fond. He has got
his promotion, and they give him the increased salary
from the day on which the minute was made by Baring,
I feel so amiable, so meek, so fond of people, so full
of gratitudes and reliances, that I am like a sick man.
And I am already counting the days between this and
coming home again."</p>

<p>He was soon, alas! to be what he compared himself
to. I met him at Rochester at the end of September,
as arranged; we passed a day and night there; a day
and night in Cobham and its neighborhood, sleeping
at the Leather Bottle; and a day and night at Gravesend.
But we were hardly returned when some slight
symptoms of bodily trouble took suddenly graver form,
and an illness followed involving the necessity of surgical
attendance. This, which with mention of the
helpful courage displayed by him has before been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
alluded to,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> put off necessarily the Glasgow dinner;
and he had scarcely left his bedroom when a trouble
arose near home which touched him to the depths of
the greatest sorrow of his life, and, in the need of exerting
himself for others, what remained of his own
illness seemed to pass away.</p>

<p>His wife's younger brother had died with the same
unexpected suddenness that attended her younger
sister's death; and the event had followed close upon
the decease of Mrs. Hogarth's mother while on a visit
to her daughter and Mr. Hogarth. "As no steps
had been taken towards the funeral," he wrote (25th
October) in reply to my offer of such service as I could
render, "I thought it best at once to bestir myself;
and not even you could have saved my going to the
cemetery. It is a great trial to me to give up Mary's
grave; greater than I can possibly express. I thought
of moving her to the catacombs and saying nothing
about it; but then I remembered that the poor old
lady is buried next her at her own desire, and could
not find it in my heart, directly she is laid in the
earth, to take her grandchild away. The desire to be
buried next her is as strong upon me now as it was five
years ago; and I <i>know</i> (for I don't think there ever
was love like that I bear her) that it will never diminish.
I fear I can do nothing. Do you think I can? They
would move her on Wednesday, if I resolved to have
it done. I cannot bear the thought of being excluded
from her dust; and yet I feel that her brothers and
sisters, and her mother, have a better right than I to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
be placed beside her. It is but an idea. I neither
think nor hope (God forbid) that our spirits would
ever mingle <i>there</i>. I ought to get the better of it, but
it is very hard. I never contemplated this&mdash;and coming
so suddenly, and after being ill, it disturbs me more
than it ought. It seems like losing her a second
time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." "No," he wrote the morning after, "I
tried that. No, there is no ground on either side to be
had. I must give it up. I shall drive over there,
please God, on Thursday morning, before they get
there; and look at her coffin."</p>

<p>He suffered more than he let any one perceive, and
was obliged again to keep his room for some days.
On the 2d of November he reported himself as progressing
and ordered to Richmond, which, after a week
or so, he changed to the White Hart at Windsor, where
I passed some days with him, Mrs. Dickens, and her
younger sister Georgina; but it was not till near the
close of that month he could describe himself as
thoroughly on his legs again, in the ordinary state on
which he was wont to pride himself, bolt upright,
staunch at the knees, a deep sleeper, a hearty eater, a
good laugher, and nowhere a bit the worse, "bating a
little weakness now and then, and a slight nervousness
at times."</p>

<p>We had some days of much enjoyment at the end of
the year, when Landor came up from Bath for the
christening of his godson; and the "Britannia," which
was to take the travelers from us in January, brought
over to them in December all sorts of cordialities, anticipations,
and stretchings-forth of palms, in token of
the welcome awaiting them. On New Year's Eve they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
dined with me, and I with them on New Year's Day;
when (his house having been taken for the period of
his absence by General Sir John Wilson) we sealed up
his wine-cellar, after opening therein some sparkling
Moselle in honor of the ceremony, and drinking it
then and there to his happy return. Next morning (it
was a Sunday) I accompanied them to Liverpool,
Maclise having been suddenly stayed by his mother's
death; the intervening day and its occupations have
been humorously sketched in his American book; and
on the 4th they sailed. I never saw the Britannia
after I stepped from her deck back to the small steamer
that had taken us to her. "How little I thought"
(were the last lines of his first American letter), "the
first time you mounted the shapeless coat, that I should
have such a sad association with its back as when I saw
it by the paddle-box of that small steamer!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first lines of that letter were written as soon as
he got sight of earth again, from the banks of Newfoundland,
on Monday, the 17th of January, the fourteenth
day from their departure: even then so far from
Halifax that they could not expect to make it before
Wednesday night, or to reach Boston until Saturday or
Sunday. They had not been fortunate in the passage.
During the whole voyage the weather had been unprecedentedly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
bad, the wind for the most part dead against
them, the wet intolerable, the sea horribly disturbed,
the days dark, and the nights fearful. On the previous
Monday night it had blown a hurricane, beginning at
five in the afternoon and raging all night. His description
of the storm is published, and the peculiarities of
a steamer's behavior in such circumstances are hit off
as if he had been all his life a sailor. Any but so extraordinary
an observer would have described a steamer
in a storm as he would have described a sailing-ship in
a storm. But any description of the latter would be as
inapplicable to my friend's account of the other as the
ways of a jackass to those of a mad bull. In the letter
from which it was taken, however, there were some
things addressed to myself alone: "For two or three
hours we gave it up as a lost thing; and with many
thoughts of you, and the children, and those others
who are dearest to us, waited quietly for the worst. I
never expected to see the day again, and resigned myself
to God as well as I could. It was a great comfort
to think of the earnest and devoted friends we had left
behind, and to know that the darlings would not
want."</p>

<p>This was not the exaggerated apprehension of a
landsman merely. The head engineer, who had been
in one or other of the Cunard vessels since they began
running, had never seen such stress of weather; and I
heard Captain Hewitt himself say afterwards that nothing
but a steamer, and one of that strength, could
have kept her course and stood it out. A sailing-vessel
must have beaten off and driven where she could;
while through all the fury of that gale they actually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
made fifty-four miles headlong through the tempest,
straight on end, not varying their track in the least.</p>

<p>He stood out against sickness only for the day following
that on which they sailed. For the three following
days he kept his bed, miserable enough, and had not,
until the eighth day of the voyage, six days before the
date of his letter, been able to get to work at the
dinner-table. What he then observed of his fellow-travelers,
and had to tell of their life on board, has
been set forth in his <i>Notes</i> with delightful humor; but
in its first freshness I received it in this letter, and some
whimsical passages, then suppressed, there will be no
harm in printing now:</p>

<p>"We have 86 passengers; and such a strange collection
of beasts never was got together upon the sea,
since the days of the Ark. I have never been in the
saloon since the first day; the noise, the smell, and the
closeness being quite intolerable. I have only been on
deck <i>once!</i>&mdash;and then I was surprised and disappointed
at the smallness of the panorama. The sea, running as
it does and has done, is very stupendous, and viewed
from the air or some great height would be grand no
doubt. But seen from the wet and rolling decks, in
this weather and these circumstances, it only impresses
one giddily and painfully. I was very glad to turn
away, and come below again.</p>

<p>"I have established myself, from the first, in the
ladies' cabin&mdash;you remember it? I'll describe its
other occupants, and our way of passing the time, to
you.</p>

<p>"First, for the occupants. Kate and I, and Anne&mdash;when
she is out of bed, which is not often. A queer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
little Scotch body, a Mrs. P&mdash;,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> whose husband is a
silversmith in New York. He married her at Glasgow
three years ago, and bolted the day after the wedding;
being (which he had not told her) heavily in debt.
Since then she has been living with her mother; and
she is now going out under the protection of a male
cousin, to give him a year's trial. If she is not comfortable
at the expiration of that time, she means to go
back to Scotland again. A Mrs. B&mdash;, about 20 years
old, whose husband is on board with her. He is a
young Englishman domiciled in New York, and by
trade (as well as I can make out) a woolen-draper.
They have been married a fortnight. A Mr. and Mrs.
C&mdash;, marvelously fond of each other, complete the
catalogue. Mrs. C&mdash;, I have settled, is a publican's
daughter, and Mr. C&mdash; is running away with her, the
till, the time-piece off the bar mantel-shelf, the mother's
gold watch from the pocket at the head of the bed;
and other miscellaneous property. The women are
all pretty; unusually pretty. I never saw such good
faces together, anywhere."</p>

<p>Their "way of passing the time" will be found in
the <i>Notes</i> much as it was written to me; except that
there was one point connected with the card-playing
which he feared might overtax the credulity of his
readers, but which he protested had occurred more
than once: "Apropos of rolling, I have forgotten to
mention that in playing whist we are obliged to put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the tricks in our pockets, to keep them from disappearing
altogether; and that five or six times in the course
of every rubber we are all flung from our seats, roll out
at different doors, and keep on rolling until we are
picked up by stewards. This has become such a
matter of course, that we go through it with perfect
gravity, and, when we are bolstered up on our sofas
again, resume our conversation or our game at the
point where it was interrupted." The news that excited
them from day to day, too, of which little more
than a hint appears in the <i>Notes</i>, is worth giving as
originally written:</p>

<p>"As for news, we have more of that than you would
think for. One man lost fourteen pounds at vingt-un
in the saloon yesterday, or another got drunk before
dinner was over, or another was blinded with lobster-sauce
spilt over him by the steward, or another had a
fall on deck and fainted. The ship's cook was drunk
yesterday morning (having got at some salt-water-damaged
whiskey), and the captain ordered the boatswain
to play upon him with the hose of the fire-engine until
he roared for mercy&mdash;which he didn't get: for he was
sentenced to look out, for four hours at a stretch for
four nights running, without a great-coat, and to have
his grog stopped. Four dozen plates were broken at
dinner. One steward fell down the cabin stairs with a
round of beef, and injured his foot severely. Another
steward fell down after him and cut his eye open. The
baker's taken ill; so is the pastry-cook. A new man,
sick to death, has been required to fill the place of the
latter officer, and has been dragged out of bed and
propped up in a little house upon deck, between two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
casks, and ordered (the captain standing over him) to
make and roll out pie-crust; which he protests, with
tears in his eyes, it is death to him in his bilious state
to look at. Twelve dozen of bottled porter has got
loose upon deck, and the bottles are rolling about distractedly,
overhead. Lord Mulgrave (a handsome
fellow, by-the-by, to look at, and nothing but a good
'un to go) laid a wager with twenty-five other men last
night, whose berths, like his, are in the fore-cabin,
which can only be got at by crossing the deck, that he
would reach his cabin first. Watches were set by the
captain's, and they sallied forth, wrapped up in coats
and storm caps. The sea broke over the ship so
violently, that they were <i>five-and-twenty minutes</i> holding
on by the handrail at the starboard paddle-box,
drenched to the skin by every wave, and not daring to
go on or come back, lest they should be washed overboard.
News! A dozen murders in town wouldn't
interest us half as much."</p>

<p>Nevertheless their excitements were not over. At
the very end of the voyage came an incident very
lightly touched in the <i>Notes</i>, but more freely told
to me under date of the 21st January: "We were
running into Halifax harbor on Wednesday night,
with little wind and a bright moon; had made the
light at its outer entrance, and given the ship in charge
to the pilot; were playing our rubber, all in good
spirits (for it had been comparatively smooth for some
days, with tolerably dry decks and other unusual comforts),
when suddenly the ship <span class="smcap">struck</span>! A rush upon
deck followed, of course. The men (I mean the crew!
think of this) were kicking off their shoes and throwing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
off their jackets preparatory to swimming ashore;
the pilot was beside himself; the passengers dismayed;
and everything in the most intolerable confusion and
hurry. Breakers were roaring ahead; the land within
a couple of hundred yards; and the vessel driving
upon the surf, although her paddles were worked backwards,
and everything done to stay her course. It is
not the custom of steamers, it seems, to have an anchor
ready. An accident occurred in getting ours over the
side; and for half an hour we were throwing up rockets,
burning blue-lights, and firing signals of distress, all of
which remained unanswered, though we were so close
to the shore that we could see the waving branches of
the trees. All this time, as we veered about, a man was
heaving the lead every two minutes; the depths of water
constantly decreasing; and nobody self-possessed but
Hewitt. They let go the anchor at last, got out a boat,
and sent her ashore with the fourth officer, the pilot,
and four men aboard, to try and find out where we were.
The pilot had no idea; but Hewitt put his little finger
upon a certain part of the chart, and was as confident
of the exact spot (though he had never been there in
his life) as if he had lived there from infancy. The
boat's return about an hour afterwards proved him to
be quite right. We had got into a place called the
Eastern Passage, in a sudden fog and through the pilot's
folly. We had struck upon a mud-bank, and driven
into a perfect little pond, surrounded by banks and
rocks and shoals of all kinds: the only safe speck in
the place. Eased by this report, and the assurance that
the tide was past the ebb, we turned in at three o'clock
in the morning, to lie there all night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day's landing at Halifax, and delivery of
the mails, are sketched in the <i>Notes;</i> but not his personal
part in what followed: "Then, sir, comes a
breathless man who has been already into the ship and
out again, shouting my name as he tears along. I stop,
arm in arm with the little doctor whom I have taken
ashore for oysters. The breathless man introduces himself
as The Speaker of the House of Assembly; <i>will</i>
drag me away to his house; and <i>will</i> have a carriage
and his wife sent down for Kate, who is laid up with a
hideously swoln face. Then he drags me up to the
Governor's house (Lord Falkland is the governor), and
then Heaven knows where; concluding with both
houses of parliament, which happen to meet for the
session that very day, and are opened by a mock speech
from the throne delivered by the governor, with one of
Lord Grey's sons for his aide-de-camp, and a great
host of officers about him. I wish you could have seen
the crowds cheering the inimitable<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> in the streets. I
wish you could have seen judges, law-officers, bishops,
and law-makers welcoming the inimitable. I wish you
could have seen the inimitable shown to a great elbow-chair
by the Speaker's throne, and sitting alone in the
middle of the floor of the House of Commons, the observed
of all observers, listening with exemplary gravity
to the queerest speaking possible, and breaking in spite
of himself into a smile as he thought of this commencement
to the Thousand and One stories in reserve for
home and Lincoln's Inn Fields and Jack Straw's Castle.&mdash;Ah,
Forster! when I <i>do</i> come back again!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>
<p>He resumed his letter at Tremont House on Saturday,
the 28th of January, having reached Boston that
day week at five in the afternoon; and, as his first
American experience is very lightly glanced at in the
<i>Notes</i>, a fuller picture will perhaps be welcome. "As
the Cunard boats have a wharf of their own at the
custom-house, and that a narrow one, we were a long
time (an hour at least) working in. I was standing in
full fig on the paddle-box beside the captain, staring
about me, when suddenly, long before we were moored
to the wharf, a dozen men came leaping on board at
the peril of their lives, with great bundles of newspapers
under their arms; worsted comforters (very much the
worse for wear) round their necks; and so forth. 'Aha!'
says I, 'this is like our London Bridge;' believing of
course that these visitors were news-boys. But what
do you think of their being <span class="smcap">Editors</span>? And what do
you think of their tearing violently up to me and
beginning to shake hands like madmen? Oh! if you
could have seen how I wrung their wrists! And if you
could but know how I hated one man in very dirty
gaiters, and with very protruding upper teeth, who said
to all comers after him, 'So you've been introduced to
our friend Dickens&mdash;eh?' There was one among them,
though, who really was of use; a Doctor S., editor of
the &mdash;&mdash;. He ran off here (two miles at least), and
ordered rooms and dinner. And in course of time
Kate, and I, and Lord Mulgrave (who was going back
to his regiment at Montreal on Monday, and had
agreed to live with us in the mean while) sat down in a
spacious and handsome room to a very handsome dinner,
bating peculiarities of putting on table, and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
forgotten the ship entirely. A Mr. Alexander, to
whom I had written from England promising to sit for
a portrait, was on board directly we touched the land,
and brought us here in his carriage. Then, after sending
a present of most beautiful flowers, he left us to
ourselves, and we thanked him for it."</p>

<p>What further he had to say of that week's experience
finds its first public utterance here. "How can I tell
you," he continues, "what has happened since that first
day? How can I give you the faintest notion of my
reception here; of the crowds that pour in and out
the whole day; of the people that line the streets when
I go out; of the cheering when I went to the theatre;
of the copies of verses, letters of congratulation, welcomes
of all kinds, balls, dinners, assemblies without
end? There is to be a public dinner to me here in
Boston, next Tuesday, and great dissatisfaction has
been given to the many by the high price (three pounds
sterling each) of the tickets. There is to be a ball
next Monday week at New York, and 150 names appear
on the list of the committee. There is to be a dinner
in the same place, in the same week, to which I have
had an invitation with every known name in America
appended to it. But what can I tell you about any of
these things which will give you the slightest notion of
the enthusiastic greeting they give me, or the cry that
runs through the whole country? I have had deputations
from the Far West, who have come from more
than two thousand miles' distance: from the lakes, the
rivers, the back-woods, the log houses, the cities, factories,
villages, and towns. Authorities from nearly all
the States have written to me. I have heard from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
universities, Congress, Senate, and bodies, public and
private, of every sort and kind. 'It is no-nonsense,
and no common feeling,' wrote Dr. Channing to me
yesterday. 'It is all heart. There never was, and
never will be, such a triumph.' And it is a good
thing, is it not, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to find those fancies it has given
me and you the greatest satisfaction to think of, at the
core of it all? It makes my heart quieter, and me a
more retiring, sober, tranquil man, to watch the effect
of those thoughts in all this noise and hurry, even than
if I sat, pen in hand, to put them down for the first
time. I feel, in the best aspects of this welcome,
something of the presence and influence of that spirit
which directs my life, and through a heavy sorrow
has pointed upwards with unchanging finger for more
than four years past. And if I know my heart, not
twenty times this praise would move me to an act of
folly."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>There were but two days more before the post left
for England, and the close of this part of his letter
sketched the engagements that awaited him on leaving
Boston: "We leave here next Saturday. We go to a
place called Worcester, about 75 miles off, to the house
of the governor of this place; and stay with him all
Sunday. On Monday we go on by railroad about 50
miles further to a town called Springfield, where I am
met by a 'reception committee' from Hartford 20
miles further, and carried on by the multitude: I am
sure I don't know how, but I shouldn't wonder if they
appear with a triumphal car. On Wednesday I have
a public dinner there. On Friday I shall be obliged
to present myself in public again, at a place called New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Haven, about 30 miles further. On Saturday evening
I hope to be at New York; and there I shall stay ten
days or a fortnight. You will suppose that I have
enough to do. I am sitting for a portrait and for a
bust. I have the correspondence of a secretary of
state, and the engagements of a fashionable physician.
I have a secretary whom I take on with me. He is a
young man of the name of Q.; was strongly recommended
to me; is most modest, obliging, silent, and
willing; and does his work <i>well</i>. He boards and
lodges at my expense when we travel; and his salary
is ten dollars per month&mdash;about two pounds five of our
English money. There will be dinners and balls at
Washington, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and I believe
everywhere. In Canada, I have promised to <i>play</i> at
the theatre with the officers, for the benefit of a charity.
We are already weary, at times, past all expression; and
I finish this by means of a pious fraud. We were engaged
to a party, and have written to say we are
both desperately ill.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 'Well,' I can fancy you
saying, 'but about his impressions of Boston and the
Americans?'&mdash;Of the latter, I will not say a word until
I have seen more of them, and have gone into the interior.
I will only say, now, that we have never yet
been required to dine at a table-d'h&ocirc;te; that, thus far,
our rooms are as much our own here as they would be
at the Clarendon; that but for an odd phrase now and
then&mdash;such as <i>Snap of cold weather;</i> a <i>tongue-y man</i> for
a talkative fellow; <i>Possible?</i> as a solitary interrogation;
and <i>Yes?</i> for indeed&mdash;I should have marked, so
far, no difference whatever between the parties here
and those I have left behind. The women are very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
beautiful, but they soon fade; the general breeding is
neither stiff nor forward; the good nature, universal.
If you ask the way to a place&mdash;of some common water-side
man, who don't know you from Adam&mdash;he turns
and goes with you. Universal deference is paid to
ladies; and they, walk about at all seasons, wholly unprotected.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
This hotel is a trifle smaller than
Finsbury Square; and is made so infernally hot (I use
the expression advisedly) by means of a furnace with
pipes running through the passages, that we can hardly
bear it. There are no curtains to the beds, or to the
bedroom windows. I am told there never are, hardly,
all through America. The bedrooms are indeed very
bare of furniture. Ours is nearly as large as your great
room, and has a wardrobe in it of painted wood not
larger (I appeal to K.) than an English watch-box. I
slept in this room for two nights, quite satisfied with
the belief that it was a shower-bath."</p>

<p>The last addition made to this letter, from which
many vividest pages of the <i>Notes</i> (among them the
bright quaint picture of Boston streets) were taken with
small alteration, bore date the 29th of January: "I
hardly know what to add to all this long and unconnected
history. Dana, the author of that <i>Two Years before
the Mast</i>" (a book which I had praised much to him,
thinking it like De Foe), "is a very nice fellow indeed;
and in appearance not at all the man you would expect.
He is short, mild-looking, and has a care-worn face.
His father is exactly like George Cruikshank after a
night's jollity&mdash;only shorter. The professors at the
Cambridge university, Longfellow, Felton, Jared Sparks,
are noble fellows. So is Kenyon's friend, Ticknor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Bancroft is a famous man; a straightforward, manly,
earnest heart; and talks much of you, which is a great
comfort. Doctor Channing I will tell you more of,
after I have breakfasted alone with him next Wednesday.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Sumner is of great service to me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
president of the Senate here presides at my dinner on
Tuesday. Lord Mulgrave lingered with us till last
Tuesday (we had our little captain to dinner on the
Monday), and then went on to Canada. Kate is quite
well, and so is Anne, whose smartness surpasses belief.
They yearn for home, and so do I.</p>

<p>"Of course you will not see in the papers any true
account of our voyage, for they keep the dangers of the
passage, when there are any, very quiet. I observed so
many perils peculiar to steamers that I am still undecided
whether we shall not return by one of the New
York liners. On the night of the storm, I was wondering
within myself where we should be, if the chimney
were blown overboard; in which case, it needs no great
observation to discover that the vessel must be instantly
on fire from stem to stern. When I went on deck next
day, I saw that it was held up by a perfect forest of
chains and ropes, which had been rigged in the night.
Hewitt told me (when we were on shore, not before)
that they had men lashed, hoisted up, and swinging
there, all through the gale, getting these stays about it.
This is not agreeable&mdash;is it?</p>

<p>"I wonder whether you will remember that next
Tuesday is my birthday! This letter will leave here
that morning.</p>

<p>"On looking back through these sheets, I am astonished
to find how little I have told you, and how much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
I have, even now, in store which shall be yours by word
of mouth. The American poor, the American factories,
the institutions of all kinds&mdash;I have a book, already.
There is no man in this town, or in this State of New
England, who has not a blazing fire and a meat dinner
every day of his life. A flaming sword in the air would
not attract so much attention as a beggar in the streets.
There are no charity uniforms, no wearisome repetition
of the same dull ugly dress, in that blind school.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> All
are attired after their own tastes, and every boy and
girl has his or her individuality as distinct and unimpaired
as you would find it in their own homes. At the
theatres, all the ladies sit in the fronts of the boxes.
The gallery are as quiet as the dress circle at dear
Drury Lane. A man with seven heads would be no
sight at all, compared with one who couldn't read and
write.</p>

<p>"I won't speak (I say 'speak'! I wish I could) about
the dear precious children, because I know how much
we shall hear about them when we receive those letters
from home for which we long so ardently."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Unmistakably to be seen, in this earliest of his letters,
is the quite fresh and unalloyed impression first
received by him at this memorable visit; and it is due,
as well to himself as to the great country which welcomed
him, that this should be considered independently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of any modification it afterwards underwent. Of
the fervency and universality of the welcome there could
indeed be no doubt, and as little that it sprang from
feelings honorable both to giver and receiver. The
sources of Dickens's popularity in England were in
truth multiplied many-fold in America. The hearty,
cordial, and humane side of his genius had fascinated
them quite as much; but there was also something beyond
this. The cheerful temper that had given new
beauty to the commonest forms of life, the abounding
humor which had added largely to all innocent enjoyment,
the honorable and in those days rare distinction
of America which left no home in the Union inaccessible
to such advantages, had made Dickens the object
everywhere of grateful admiration, for the most part of
personal affection. But even this was not all. I do not
say it either to lessen or to increase the value of the
tribute, but to express simply what it was; and there
cannot be a question that the young English author,
whom by his language they claimed equally for their
own, was almost universally regarded by the Americans
as a kind of embodied protest against what they believed
to be worst in the institutions of England, depressing
and overshadowing in a social sense, and
adverse to purely intellectual influences. In all the
papers of every grade in the Union, of which many
were sent to me at the time, the feeling of triumph over
the mother-country in this particular is everywhere predominant.
You Worship titles, they said, and military
heroes, and millionaires, and we of the New World
want to show you, by extending the kind of homage
that the Old World reserves for kings and conquerors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
to a young man with nothing to distinguish him but his
heart and his genius, what it is we think in these parts
worthier of honor, than birth, or wealth, a title, or a
sword. Well, there was something in this too, apart
from a mere crowing over the mother-country. The
Americans had honestly more than a common share in
the triumphs of a genius which in more than one sense
had made the deserts and wildernesses of life to blossom
like the rose. They were entitled to select for a welcome,
as emphatic as they might please to render it, the
writer who pre-eminently in his generation had busied
himself to "detect and save," in human creatures, such
sparks of virtue as misery or vice had not availed to
extinguish; to discover what is beautiful and comely
under what commonly passes for the ungainly and the
deformed; to draw happiness and hopefulness from
despair itself; and, above all, so to have made known
to his own countrymen the wants and sufferings of
the poor, the ignorant, and the neglected, that they
could be left in absolute neglect no more. "A triumph
has been prepared for him," wrote Mr. Ticknor
to our dear friend Kenyon, "in which the whole country
will join. He will have a progress through the
States unequaled since Lafayette's." Daniel Webster
told the Americans that Dickens had done more
already to ameliorate the condition of the English
poor than all the statesmen Great Britain had sent
into Parliament. His sympathies are such, exclaimed
Dr. Channing, as to recommend him in an especial
manner to us. He seeks out that class, in order to
benefit them, with whom American institutions and
laws sympathize most strongly; and it is in the passions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
sufferings, and virtues of the mass that he has
found his subjects of most thrilling interest. "He
shows that life in its rudest form may wear a tragic
grandeur; that amidst follies and excesses, provoking
laughter or scorn, the moral feelings do not wholly
die; and that the haunts of the blackest crime are
sometimes lighted up by the presence and influence of
the noblest souls. His pictures have a tendency to
awaken sympathy with our race, and to change the
unfeeling indifference which has prevailed towards the
depressed multitude, into a sorrowful and indignant
sensibility to their wrongs and woes."</p>

<p>Whatever may be the turn which we are to see the
welcome take, by dissatisfaction that arose on both
sides, it is well that we should thus understand what in
its first manifestations was honorable to both. Dickens
had his disappointments, and the Americans had theirs;
but what was really genuine in the first enthusiasm remained
without grave alloy from either; and the letters,
as I proceed to give them, will so naturally explain
and illustrate the misunderstanding as to require little
further comment. I am happy to be able here to place
on record fac-similes of the invitations to the public
entertainments in New York which reached him before
he quitted Boston. The mere signatures suffice to show
how universal the welcome was from that great city of
the Union.<a name="facs1" id="facs1"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">His</span> second letter, radiant with the same kindly
warmth that gave always pre-eminent charm to his
genius, was dated from the Carlton Hotel, New York,
on the 14th February, but its only allusion of any public
interest was to the beginning of his agitation of the
question of international copyright. He went to America<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
with no express intention of starting this question
in any way, and certainly with no belief that such remark
upon it as a person in his position could alone be
expected to make would be resented strongly by any
sections of the American people. But he was not long
left in doubt on this head. He had spoken upon it
twice publicly, "to the great indignation of some of
the editors here, who are attacking me for so doing,
right and left." On the other hand, all the best men
had assured him that, if only at once followed up in
England, the blow struck might bring about a change
in the law; and, yielding to the pleasant hope that the
best men could be a match for the worst, he urged me
to enlist on his side what force I could, and in particular,
as he had made Scott's claim his war-cry, to bring
Lockhart into the field. I could not do much, but I
did what I could.</p>

<p>Three days later he began another letter; and, as
this will be entirely new to the reader, I shall print it
as it reached me, with only such omission of matter
concerning myself as I think it my duty, however reluctantly,
to make throughout these extracts. There
was nothing in its personal details, or in those relating
to international copyright, available for his <i>Notes;</i> from
which they were excluded by the two rules he observed
in that book,&mdash;the first to be altogether silent as to the
copyright discussion, and the second to abstain from
all mention of individuals. But there can be no harm
here in violating either rule, for, as Sydney Smith said
with his humorous sadness, "We are all dead now."</p>

<p>"Carlton House, New York: Thursday, February
Seventeenth, 1842.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As there is a sailing-packet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
from here to England to-morrow which is warranted
(by the owners) to be a marvelous fast sailer, and as
it appears most probable that she will reach home (I
write the word with a pang) before the Cunard steamer
of next month, I indite this letter. And lest this letter
should reach you before another letter which I dispatched
from here last Monday, let me say in the first
place that I <i>did</i> dispatch a brief epistle to you on that
day, together with a newspaper, and a pamphlet touching
the Boz ball; and that I put in the post-office at
Boston another newspaper for you containing an account
of the dinner, which was just about to come off,
you remember, when I wrote to you from that city.</p>

<p>"It was a most superb affair; and the speaking <i>admirable</i>.
Indeed, the general talent for public speaking
here is one of the most striking of the things that force
themselves upon an Englishman's notice. As every
man looks on to being a member of Congress, every
man prepares himself for it; and the result is quite surprising.
You will observe one odd custom,&mdash;the drinking
of sentiments. It is quite extinct with us, but here
everybody is expected to be prepared with an epigram
as a matter of course.</p>

<p>"We left Boston on the fifth, and went away with the
governor of the city to stay till Monday at his house at
Worcester. He married a sister of Bancroft's, and
another sister of Bancroft's went down with us. The
village of Worcester is one of the prettiest in New
England.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On Monday morning at nine o'clock
we started again by railroad and went on to Springfield,
where a deputation of two were waiting, and everything
was in readiness that the utmost attention could suggest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Owing to the mildness of the weather, the Connecticut
river was 'open,' videlicet not frozen, and they had a
steamboat ready to carry us on to Hartford; thus saving
a land-journey of only twenty-five miles, but on such
roads at this time of year that it takes nearly twelve hours
to accomplish! The boat was very small, the river full
of floating blocks of ice, and the depth where we went
(to avoid the ice and the current) not more than a few
inches. After two hours and a half of this queer traveling,
we got to Hartford. There, there was quite an English
inn; except in respect of the bedrooms, which are
always uncomfortable; and the best committee of management
that has yet presented itself. They kept us
more quiet, and were more considerate and thoughtful,
even to their own exclusion, than any I have yet had
to deal with. Kate's face being horribly bad, I determined
to give her a rest here; and accordingly wrote
to get rid of my engagement at New Haven, on that
plea. We remained in this town until the eleventh:
holding a formal levee every day for two hours, and
receiving on each from two hundred to three hundred
people. At five o'clock on the afternoon of
the eleventh, we set off (still by railroad) for New
Haven, which we reached about eight o'clock. The
moment we had had tea, we were forced to open
another levee for the students and professors of the
college (the largest in the States), and the townspeople.
I suppose we shook hands, before going to bed, with
considerably more than five hundred people; and I
stood, as a matter of course, the whole time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Now, the deputation of two had come on with us
from Hartford; and at New Haven there was another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
committee; and the immense fatigue and worry of all
this, no words can exaggerate. We had been in the
morning over jails and deaf and dumb asylums; had
stopped on the journey at a place called Wallingford,
where a whole town had turned out to see me, and to
gratify whose curiosity the train stopped expressly; had
had a day of great excitement and exertion on the
Thursday (this being Friday); and were inexpressibly
worn out. And when at last we got to bed and were
'going' to fall asleep, the choristers of the college
turned out in a body, under the window, and serenaded
us! We had had, by-the-by, another serenade at Hartford,
from a Mr. Adams (a nephew of John Quincy
Adams) and a German friend. <i>They</i> were most beautiful
singers: and when they began, in the dead of the
night, in a long, musical, echoing passage outside our
chamber door; singing, in low voices to guitars, about
home and absent friends and other topics that they
knew would interest us; we were more moved than I
can tell you. In the midst of my sentimentality, though,
a thought occurred to me which made me laugh so immoderately
that I was obliged to cover my face with
the bedclothes. 'Good Heavens!' I said to Kate,
'what a monstrously ridiculous and commonplace appearance
my boots must have, outside the door!' I
never <i>was</i> so impressed with a sense of the absurdity
of boots, in all my life.</p>

<p>"The New Haven serenade was not so good; though
there were a great many voices, and a 'reg'lar' band.
It hadn't the heart of the other. Before it was six
hours old, we were dressing with might and main, and
making ready for our departure; it being a drive of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
twenty minutes to the steamboat, and the hour of sailing
nine o'clock. After a hasty breakfast we started
off; and after another levee on the deck (actually on
the deck), and 'three times three for Dickens,' moved
towards New York.</p>

<p>"I was delighted to find on board a Mr. Felton whom
I had known at Boston. He is the Greek professor at
Cambridge, and was going on to the ball and dinner.
Like most men of his class whom I have seen, he is
a most delightful fellow,&mdash;unaffected, hearty, genial,
jolly; quite an Englishman of the best sort. We drank
all the porter on board, ate all the cold pork and cheese,
and were very merry indeed. I should have told you,
in its proper place, that both at Hartford and New
Haven a regular bank was subscribed, by these committees,
for <i>all</i> my expenses. No bill was to be got at the
bar, and everything was paid for. But as I would on
no account suffer this to be done, I stoutly and positively
refused to budge an inch until Mr. Q. should
have received the bills from the landlord's own hands,
and paid them to the last farthing. Finding it impossible
to move me, they suffered me, most unwillingly,
to carry the point.</p>

<p>"About half-past 2 we arrived here. In half an hour
more, we reached this hotel, where a very splendid
suite of rooms was prepared for us; and where everything
is very comfortable, and no doubt (as at Boston)
<i>enormously</i> dear. Just as we sat down to dinner, David
Golden made his appearance; and when he had gone,
and we were taking our wine, Washington Irving came
in alone, with open arms. And here he stopped, until
ten o'clock at night." (Through Lord Jeffrey, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
whom he was connected by marriage, and Macready,
of whom he was the cordial friend, we already knew
Mr. Colden; and his subsequent visits to Europe led
to many years' intimate intercourse, greatly enjoyed by
us both.) "Having got so far, I shall divide my discourse
into four points. First, the ball. Secondly,
some slight specimens of a certain phase of character
in the Americans. Thirdly, international copyright.
Fourthly, my life here, and projects to be carried out
while I remain.</p>

<p>"Firstly, the ball. It came off last Monday (vide
pamphlet.) 'At a quarter-past 9, exactly' (I quote
the printed order of proceeding), we were waited upon
by 'David Colden, Esquire, and General George Morris;'
habited, the former in full ball costume, the latter
in the full dress uniform of Heaven knows what regiment
of militia. The general took Kate, Golden gave
his arm to me, and we proceeded downstairs to a carriage
at the door, which took us to the stage-door of
the theatre, greatly to the disappointment of an enormous
crowd who were besetting the main door and
making a most tremendous hullaballoo. The scene on
our entrance was very striking. There were three thousand
people present in full dress; from the roof to the
floor, the theatre was decorated magnificently; and the
light, glitter, glare, show, noise, and cheering, baffle
my descriptive powers. We were walked in through
the centre of the centre dress-box, the front whereof
was taken out for the occasion; so to the back of the
stage, where the mayor and other dignitaries received
us; and we were then paraded all round the enormous
ball-room, twice, for the gratification of the many-headed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
That done, we began to dance&mdash;Heaven knows
how we did it, for there was no room. And we continued
dancing until, being no longer able even to
stand, we slipped away quietly, and came back to the
hotel. All the documents connected with this extraordinary
festival (quite unparalleled here) we have preserved;
so you may suppose that on this head alone we
shall have enough to show you when we come home.
The bill of fare for supper is, in its amount and extent,
quite a curiosity.</p>

<p>"Now, the phase of character in the Americans
which amuses me most was put before me in its most
amusing shape by the circumstances attending this
affair. I had noticed it before, and have since; but I
cannot better illustrate it than by reference to this
theme. Of course I can do nothing but in some shape
or other it gets into the newspapers. All manner of
lies get there, and occasionally a truth so twisted and
distorted that it has as much resemblance to the real
fact as Quilp's leg to Taglioni's. But with this ball to
come off, the newspapers were if possible unusually
loquacious; and in their accounts of me, and my seeings,
sayings, and doings on the Saturday night and
Sunday before, they describe my manner, mode of
speaking, dressing, and so forth. In doing this, they
report that I am a very charming fellow (of course),
and have a very free and easy way with me; 'which,'
say they, 'at first amused a few fashionables;' but soon
pleased them exceedingly. Another paper, coming
after the ball, dwells upon its splendor and brilliancy;
hugs itself and its readers upon all that Dickens saw,
and winds up by gravely expressing its conviction that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Dickens was never in such society in England as he
has seen in New York, and that its high and striking
tone cannot fail to make an indelible impression on
his mind! For the same reason I am always represented,
whenever I appear in public, as being 'very
pale;' 'apparently thunderstruck;' and utterly confounded
by all I see.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You recognize the queer
vanity which is at the root of all this? I have plenty
of stories in connection with it to amuse you with when
I return."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='date'>
"<i>Twenty-fourth February.</i><br />
</div>

<p>"It is unnecessary to say .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that this letter <i>didn't</i>
come by the sailing packet, and <i>will</i> come by the
Cunard boat. After the ball I was laid up with a very
bad sore throat, which confined me to the house four
whole days; and as I was unable to write, or indeed to
do anything but doze and drink lemonade, I missed
the ship.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have still a horrible cold, and so has
Kate, but in other respects we are all right. I proceed
to my third head: the international copyright question.</p>

<p>"I believe there is no country on the face of the
earth where there is less freedom of opinion on any
subject in reference to which there is a broad difference
of opinion, than in this.&mdash;There!&mdash;I write the words
with reluctance, disappointment, and sorrow; but I
believe it from the bottom of my soul. I spoke, as
you know, of international copyright, at Boston; and
I spoke of it again at Hartford. My friends were
paralyzed with wonder at such audacious daring. The
notion that I, a man alone by himself, in America,
should venture to suggest to the Americans that there
was one point on which they were neither just to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
own countrymen nor to us, actually struck the boldest
dumb! Washington Irving, Prescott, Hoffman, Bryant,
Halleck, Dana, Washington Allston&mdash;every man who
writes in this country is devoted to the question, and
not one of them <i>dares</i> to raise his voice and complain
of the atrocious state of the law. It is nothing that
of all men living I am the greatest loser by it. It is
nothing that I have a claim to speak and be heard.
The wonder is that a breathing man can be found with
temerity enough to suggest to the Americans the possibility
of their having done wrong. I wish you could
have seen the faces that I saw, down both sides of the
table at Hartford, when I began to talk about Scott.
I wish you could have heard how I gave it out. My
blood so boiled as I thought of the monstrous injustice
that I felt as if I were twelve feet high when I thrust it
down their throats.</p>

<p>"I had no sooner made that second speech than such
an outcry began (for the purpose of deterring me from
doing the like in this city) as an Englishman can form
no notion of. Anonymous letters, verbal dissuasions;
newspaper attacks making Colt (a murderer who is
attracting great attention here) an angel by comparison
with me; assertions that I was no gentleman, but a
mere mercenary scoundrel; coupled with the most
monstrous misrepresentations relative to my design and
purpose in visiting the United States; came pouring in
upon me every day. The dinner committee here (composed
of the first gentlemen in America, remember
that) were so dismayed, that they besought me not to
pursue the subject, <i>although they every one agreed with
me</i>. I answered that I would. That nothing should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
deter me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That the shame was theirs, not mine;
and that as I would not spare them when I got home,
I would not be silenced here. Accordingly, when the
night came, I asserted my right, with all the means I
could command to give it dignity, in face, manner, or
words; and I believe that if you could have seen and
heard me, you would have loved me better for it than
ever you did in your life.</p>

<p>"The <i>New York Herald</i>, which you will receive with
this, is the <i>Satirist</i> of America; but having a great circulation
(on account of its commercial intelligence and
early news) it can afford to secure the best reporters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
My speech is done, upon the whole, with remarkable
accuracy. There are a great many typographical
errors in it; and by the omission of one or two words,
or the substitution of one word for another, it is often
materially weakened. Thus, I did not say that I
'claimed' my right, but that I 'asserted' it; and I did
not say that I had 'some claim,' but that I had 'a most
righteous claim,' to speak. But altogether it is very
correct."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Washington Irving was chairman of this dinner, and,
having from the first a dread that he should break down
in his speech, the catastrophe came accordingly. Near
him sat the Cambridge professor who had come with
Dickens by boat from New Haven, with whom already
a warm friendship had been formed that lasted for life,
and who has pleasantly sketched what happened. Mr.
Felton saw Irving constantly in the interval of preparation,
and could not but despond at his daily iterated
foreboding of <i>I shall certainly break down;</i> though besides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
the real dread there was a sly humor which heightened
its whimsical horror with an irresistible drollery.
But the professor plucked up hope a little when the night
came and he saw that Irving had laid under his plate
the manuscript of his speech. During dinner, nevertheless,
his old foreboding cry was still heard, and "at
last the moment arrived; Mr. Irving rose; and the
deafening and long-continued applause by no means
lessened his apprehension. He began in his pleasant
voice; got through two or three sentences pretty easily,
but in the next hesitated; and, after one or two attempts
to go on, gave it up, with a graceful allusion to the
tournament and the troop of knights all armed and
eager for the fray; and ended with the toast <span class="smcap">Charles
Dickens, the guest of the nation</span>. <i>There!</i> said
he, as he resumed his seat amid applause as great as had
greeted his rising, <i>There! I told you I should break down,
and I've done it!</i>" He was in London a few months
later, on his way to Spain; and I heard Thomas Moore
describe<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> at Rogers's table the difficulty there had been
to overcome his reluctance, because of this break-down,
to go to the dinner of the Literary Fund on the occasion
of Prince Albert's presiding. "However," said Moore,
"I told him only to attempt a few words, and I suggested
what they should be, and he said he'd never
thought of anything so easy, and he went, and did famously."
I knew very well, as I listened, that this had
<i>not</i> been the result; but as the distinguished American
had found himself, on this second occasion, not among
orators as in New York, but among men as unable as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
himself to speak in public, and equally able to do better
things,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> he was doubtless more reconciled to his own
failure. I have been led to this digression by Dickens's
silence on his friend's break-down. He had so great a
love for Irving that it was painful to speak of him as
at any disadvantage, and of the New York dinner he
wrote only in its connection with his own copyright
speeches.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The effect of all this copyright agitation at least
has been to awaken a great sensation on both sides of
the subject; the respectable newspapers and reviews
taking up the cudgels as strongly in my favor, as the
others have done against me. Some of the vagabonds
take great credit to themselves (grant us patience!) for
having made me popular by publishing my books in
newspapers: as if there were no England, no Scotland,
no Germany, no place but America in the whole world.
A splendid satire upon this kind of trash has just occurred.
A man came here yesterday, and demanded,
not besought but demanded, pecuniary assistance; and
fairly bullied Mr. Q. for money. When I came home,
I dictated a letter to this effect,&mdash;that such applications
reached me in vast numbers every day; that if I were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
a man of fortune, I could not render assistance to all
who sought it; and that, depending on my own exertion
for all the help I could give, I regretted to say I
could afford him none. Upon this, my gentleman sits
down and writes me that he is an itinerant bookseller;
that he is the first man who sold my books in New
York; that he is distressed in the city where I am
reveling in luxury; that he thinks it rather strange that
the man who wrote <i>Nickleby</i> should be utterly destitute
of feeling; and that he would have me 'take care I
don't repent it.' What do you think of <i>that?</i>&mdash;as Mac
would say. I thought it such a good commentary,
that I dispatched the letter to the editor of the only
English newspaper here, and told him he might print
it if he liked.</p>

<p>"I will tell you what <i>I</i> should like, my dear friend,
always supposing that your judgment concurs with
mine, and that you would take the trouble to get such
a document. I should like to have a short letter
addressed to me by the principal English authors
who signed the international copyright petition, expressive
of their sense that I have done my duty to the
cause. I am sure I deserve it, but I don't wish it on
that ground. It is because its publication in the best
journals here would unquestionably do great good. As
the gauntlet is down, let us go on. Clay has already
sent a gentleman to me express from Washington (where
I shall be on the 6th or 7th of next month) to declare
his strong interest in the matter, his cordial approval
of the 'manly' course I have held in reference to it,
and his desire to stir in it if possible. I have lighted
up such a blaze that a meeting of the foremost people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
on the other side (very respectfully and properly conducted
in reference to me, personally, I am bound to
say) was held in this town t'other night. And it would
be a thousand pities if we did not strike as hard as we
can, now that the iron is so hot.</p>

<p>"I have come at last, and it is time I did, to my life
here, and intentions for the future. I can do nothing
that I want to do, go nowhere where I want to go, and
see nothing that I want to see. If I turn into the
street, I am followed by a multitude. If I stay at home,
the house becomes, with callers, like a fair. If I visit
a public institution, with only one friend, the directors
come down incontinently, waylay me in the yard, and
address me in a long speech. I go to a party in the
evening, and am so inclosed and hemmed about by
people, stand where I will, that I am exhausted for want
of air. I dine out, and have to talk about everything,
to everybody. I go to church for quiet, and there is
a violent rush to the neighborhood of the pew I sit in,
and the clergyman preaches <i>at</i> me. I take my seat in
a railroad-car, and the very conductor won't leave me
alone. I get out at a station, and can't drink a glass
of water, without having a hundred people looking
down my throat when I open my mouth to swallow.
Conceive what all this is! Then by every post, letters
on letters arrive, all about nothing, and all demanding
an immediate answer. This man is offended because I
won't live in his house; and that man is thoroughly
disgusted because I won't go out more than four times
in one evening. I have no rest or peace, and am in a
perpetual worry.</p>

<p>"Under these febrile circumstances, which this climate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
especially favors, I have come to the resolution
that I will not (so far as my will has anything to do
with the matter) accept any more public entertainments
or public recognitions of any kind, during my
stay in the United States; and in pursuance of this
determination I have refused invitations from Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Washington, Virginia, Albany,
and Providence. Heaven knows whether this will be
effectual, but I shall soon see, for on Monday morning,
the 28th, we leave for Philadelphia. There I shall
only stay three days. Thence we go to Baltimore, and
<i>there</i> I shall only stay three days. Thence to Washington,
where we may stay perhaps ten days; perhaps
not so long. Thence to Virginia, where we may halt
for one day; and thence to Charleston, where we may
pass a week perhaps, and where we shall very likely
remain until your March letters reach us, through
David Colden. I had a design of going from Charleston
to Columbia in South Carolina, and there engaging
a carriage, a baggage-tender and negro boy to guard
the same, and a saddle-horse for myself,&mdash;with which
caravan I intended going 'right away,' as they say
here, into the West, through the wilds of Kentucky
and Tennessee, across the Alleghany Mountains, and
so on until we should strike the lakes and could get to
Canada. But it has been represented to me that this
is a track only known to traveling merchants; that the
roads are bad, the country a tremendous waste, the inns
log houses, and the journey one that would play the
very devil with Kate. I am staggered, but not deterred.
If I find it possible to be done in the time, I mean to
do it; being quite satisfied that without some such dash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
I can never be a free agent, or see anything worth the
telling.</p>

<p>"We mean to return home in a packet-ship,&mdash;not a
steamer. Her name is the George Washington, and she
will sail from here, for Liverpool, on the seventh of
June. At that season of the year they are seldom more
than three weeks making the voyage; and I never will
trust myself upon the wide ocean, if it please Heaven,
in a steamer again. When I tell you all that I observed
on board that Britannia, I shall astonish you. Meanwhile,
consider two of their dangers. First, that if the
funnel were blown overboard the vessel must instantly
be on fire, from stem to stern; to comprehend which
consequence, you have only to understand that the
funnel is more than 40 feet high, and that at night you
see the solid fire two or three feet above its top. Imagine
this swept down by a strong wind, and picture to yourself
the amount of flame on deck; and that a strong
wind is likely to sweep it down you soon learn, from
the precautions taken to keep it up in a storm, when it
is the first thing thought of. Secondly, each of these
boats consumes between London and Halifax 700 tons
of coals; and it is pretty clear, from this enormous difference
of weight in a ship of only 1200 tons burden
in all, that she must either be too heavy when she comes
out of port, or too light when she goes in. The daily
difference in her rolling, as she burns the coals out, is
something absolutely fearful. Add to all this, that by
day and night she is full of fire and people, that she
has no boats, and that the struggling of that enormous
machinery in a heavy sea seems as though it would rend
her into fragments&mdash;and you may have a pretty con-sid-erable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
damned good sort of a feeble notion that it
don't fit nohow; and that it a'n't calculated to make
you smart, overmuch; and that you don't feel 'special
bright; and by no means first-rate; and not at all
tonguey (or disposed for conversation); and that however
rowdy you may be by natur', it does use you up
com-plete, and that's a fact; and makes you quake
considerable, and disposed toe damn the &#277;ngin&#277;!&mdash;All
of which phrases, I beg to add, are pure Americanisms
of the first water.</p>

<p>"When we reach Baltimore, we are in the regions of
slavery. It exists there, in its least shocking and most
mitigated form; but there it is. They whisper, here
(they dare only whisper, you know, and that below their
breaths), that on that place, and all through the South,
there is a dull gloomy cloud on which the very word
seems written. I shall be able to say, one of these
days, that I accepted no public mark of respect in any
place where slavery was;&mdash;and that's something.</p>

<p>"The ladies of America are decidedly and unquestionably
beautiful. Their complexions are not so good
as those of Englishwomen; their beauty does not last
so long; and their figures are very inferior. But they
are most beautiful. I still reserve my opinion of the
national character,&mdash;just whispering that I tremble for
a radical coming here, unless he is a radical on principle,
by reason and reflection, and from the sense of
right. I fear that if he were anything else, he would
return home a Tory.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I say no more on that
head for two months from this time, save that I do
fear that the heaviest blow ever dealt at liberty will be
dealt by this country, in the failure of its example to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
the earth. The scenes that are passing in Congress
now, all tending to the separation of the States, fill one
with such a deep disgust that I dislike the very name of
Washington (meaning the place, not the man), and am
repelled by the mere thought of approaching it."</p>


<div class='date'><br />
<i>"Twenty-seventh February. Sunday.</i><br />
</div>

<p>"There begins to be great consternation here, in
reference to the Cunard packet which (we suppose) left
Liverpool on the fourth. She has not yet arrived. We
scarcely know what to do with ourselves in our extreme
anxiety to get letters from home. I have really had
serious thoughts of going back to Boston, alone, to be
nearer news. We have determined to remain here
until Tuesday afternoon, if she should not arrive before,
and to send Mr. Q. and the luggage on to Philadelphia
to-morrow morning. God grant she may not have
gone down! but every ship that comes in brings intelligence
of a terrible gale (which indeed was felt ashore
here) on the night of the fourteenth; and the sea-captains
swear (not without some prejudice, of course)
that no steamer could have lived through it, supposing
her to have been in its full fury. As there is no steam-packet
to go to England, supposing the Caledonia not
to arrive, we are obliged to send our letters by the
Garrick ship, which sails early to-morrow morning.
Consequently I must huddle this up, and dispatch it
to the post-office with all speed. I have so much to
say that I could fill quires of paper, which renders this
sudden pull-up the more provoking.</p>

<p>"I have in my portmanteau a petition for an international
copyright law, signed by all the best American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
writers, with Washington Irving at their head. They
have requested me to hand it to Clay for presentation,
and to back it with any remarks I may think proper to
offer. So 'Hoo-roar for the principle, as the money-lender
said ven he vouldn't renoo the bill.'</p>

<p>"God bless you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You know what I would say
about home and the darlings. A hundred times God
bless you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Fears are entertained for Lord Ashburton
also. Nothing has been heard of him."</p></div>

<p>A brief letter, sent me next day by the minister's
bag, was in effect a postscript to the foregoing, and
expressed still more strongly the doubts and apprehensions
his voyage out had impressed him with, and
which, though he afterwards saw reason greatly to
modify his misgivings, were not so strange at that time
as they appear to us now:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"Carlton House, New York, February twenty-eighth,
1842.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Caledonia, I grieve and regret to say,
has not arrived. If she left England to her time, she
has been four-and-twenty days at sea. There is no
news of her; and on the nights of the fourteenth and
eighteenth it blew a terrible gale, which almost justifies
the worst suspicions. For myself, I have hardly any
hope of her; having seen enough, in our passage out,
to convince me that steaming across the ocean in heavy
weather is as yet an experiment of the utmost hazard.</p>

<p>"As it was supposed that there would be no steamer
whatever for England this month (since in ordinary
course the Caledonia would have returned with the
mails on the 2d of March), I hastily got the letters
ready yesterday and sent them by the Garrick; which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
may perhaps be three weeks out, but is not very likely
to be longer. But belonging to the Cunard company
is a boat called the Unicorn, which in the summertime
plies up the St. Lawrence, and brings passengers
from Canada to join the British and North American
steamers at Halifax. In the winter she lies at the last-mentioned
place; from which news has come this
morning that they have sent her on to Boston for the
mails, and, rather than interrupt the communication,
mean to dispatch her to England in lieu of the poor
Caledonia. This in itself, by the way, is a daring
deed; for she was originally built to run between
Liverpool and Glasgow, and is no more designed for
the Atlantic than a Calais packet-boat; though she
once crossed it, in the summer season.</p>

<p>"You may judge, therefore, what the owners think
of the probability of the Caledonia's arrival. How
slight an alteration in our plans would have made us
passengers on board of her!</p>

<p>"It would be difficult to tell you, my dear fellow,
what an impression this has made upon our minds, or
with what intense anxiety and suspense we have been
waiting for your letters from home. We were to have
gone South to-day, but linger here until to-morrow
afternoon (having sent the secretary and luggage forward)
for one more chance of news. Love to dear
Macready, and to dear Mac, and every one we care for.
It's useless to speak of the dear children. It seems now
as though we should never hear of them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"P.S. Washington Irving is a <i>great</i> fellow. We
have laughed most heartily together. He is just the
man he ought to be. So is Doctor Channing, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
whom I have had an interesting correspondence since
I saw him last at Boston. Halleck is a merry little
man. Bryant a sad one, and very reserved. Washington
Allston the painter (who wrote <i>Monaldi</i>) is a
fine specimen of a glorious old genius. Longfellow,
whose volume of poems I have got for you, is a frank
accomplished man as well as a fine writer, and will be
in town 'next fall.' Tell Macready that I suspect
prices here must have rather altered since his time. I
paid our fortnight's bill here, last night. We have
dined out every day (except when I was laid up with
a sore throat), and only had in all four bottles of wine.
The bill was 70<i>l.</i> English!!!</p>

<p>"You will see, by my other letter, how we have
been f&ecirc;ted and feasted; and how there is war to the
knife about the international copyright; and how I
<i>will</i> speak about it, and decline to be put down.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Oh for news from home! I think of your letters
so full of heart and friendship, with perhaps a little
scrawl of Charley's or Mamey's, lying at the bottom
of the deep sea; and am as full of sorrow as if they
had once been living creatures.&mdash;Well! they <i>may</i>
come, yet."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They did reach him, but not by the Caledonia. His
fears as to that vessel were but too well founded. On
the very day when she was due in Boston (the 18th of
February) it was learned in London that she had undergone
misadventure; that, her decks having been swept
and her rudder torn away, though happily no lives were
lost, she had returned disabled to Cork; and that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Acadia, having received her passengers and mails, was
to sail with them from Liverpool next day.</p>

<p>Of the main subject of that letter written on the day
preceding,&mdash;of the quite unpremeditated impulse, out
of which sprang his advocacy of claims which he felt
to be represented in his person,&mdash;of the injustice done
by his entertainers to their guest in ascribing such advocacy
to selfishness,&mdash;and of the graver wrong done
by them to their own highest interests, nay, even to
their commonest and most vulgar interests, in continuing
to reject those claims, I will add nothing now to
what all those years ago I labored very hard to lay before
many readers. It will be enough if I here print,
from the authors' letters I sent out to him by the next
following mail, in compliance with his wish, this which
follows from a very dear friend of his and mine. I
fortunately had it transcribed before I posted it to him;
Mr. Carlyle having in some haste written from "Templand,
26 March, 1842," and taken no copy.</p>

<p>"We learn by the newspapers that you everywhere
in America stir up the question of international copyright,
and thereby awaken huge dissonance where all
else were triumphant unison for you. I am asked my
opinion of the matter, and requested to write it down
in words.</p>

<p>"Several years ago, if memory err not, I was one of
many English writers who, under the auspices of Miss
Martineau, did already sign a petition to congress praying
for an international copyright between the two
Nations,&mdash;which properly are not two Nations, but one;
<i>indivisible</i> by parliament, congress, or any kind of human
law or diplomacy, being already <i>united</i> by Heaven's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Act of Parliament, and the everlasting law of Nature
and Fact. To that opinion I still adhere, and am like
to continue adhering.</p>

<p>"In discussion of the matter before any congress or
parliament, manifold considerations and argumentations
will necessarily arise; which to me are not interesting,
nor essential for helping me to a decision. They respect
the time and manner in which the thing should
be; not at all whether the thing should be or not. In
an ancient book, reverenced I should hope on both
sides of the Ocean, it was thousands of years ago
written down in the most decisive and explicit manner,
'Thou <i>shalt not</i> steal.' That thou belongest to a different
'Nation,' and canst steal without being certainly
hanged for it, gives thee no permission to steal! Thou
shalt <i>not</i> in anywise steal at all! So it is written down,
for Nations and for Men, in the Law-Book of the
Maker of this Universe. Nay, poor Jeremy Bentham
and others step in here, and will demonstrate that it is
actually our true convenience and expediency not to
steal; which I for my share, on the great scale and on
the small, and in all conceivable scales and shapes, do
also firmly believe it to be. For example, if Nations
abstained from stealing, what need were there of fighting,&mdash;with
its butcherings and burnings, decidedly the
most expensive thing in this world? How much more
two Nations, which, as I said, are but one Nation;
knit in a thousand ways by Nature and Practical Intercourse;
indivisible brother elements of the same great
<span class="smcap">Saxondom</span>, to which in all honorable ways be long life!</p>

<p>"When Mr. Robert Roy M'Gregor lived in the district
of Menteith on the Highland border two centuries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
ago, he for his part found it more convenient to supply
himself with beef by stealing it alive from the adjacent
glens, than by buying it killed in the Stirling butchers'
market. It was Mr. Roy's plan of supplying himself
with beef in those days, this of stealing it. In many
a little 'Congress' in the district of Menteith, there
was debating, doubt it not, and much specious argumentation
this way and that, before they could ascertain
that, really and truly, buying was the best way to
get your beef; which, however, in the long run they
did with one assent find it indisputably to be: and accordingly
they hold by it to this day."</p>

<p>This brave letter was an important service rendered
at a critical time, and Dickens was very grateful for it.
But, as time went on, he had other and higher causes
for gratitude to its writer. Admiration of Carlyle increased
in him with his years; and there was no one
whom in later life he honored so much, or had a more
profound regard for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickens's</span> next letter was begun in the "United
States Hotel, Philadelphia," and bore date "Sunday,
sixth March, 1842." It treated of much dealt with
afterwards at greater length in the <i>Notes</i>, but the freshness
and vivacity of the first impressions in it have surprised
me. I do not, however, print any passage here
which has not its own interest independently of anything
contained in that book. The rule will be continued,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
as in the portions of letters already given, of
not transcribing anything before printed, or anything
having even but a near resemblance to descriptions that
appear in the <i>Notes</i>.</p>

<p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As this is likely to be the only
quiet day I shall have for a long time, I devote it to
writing to you. We have heard nothing from you<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> yet,
and only have for our consolation the reflection that
the Columbia<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> is now on her way out. No news
had been heard of the Caledonia yesterday afternoon,
when we left New York. We <i>were</i> to have quitted
that place last Tuesday, but have been detained there
all the week by Kate having so bad a sore throat that
she was obliged to keep her bed. We left yesterday
afternoon at five o'clock, and arrived here at eleven last
night. Let me say, by the way, that this is a very trying
climate.</p>

<p>"I have often asked Americans in London which
were the better railroads,&mdash;ours or theirs? They have
taken time for reflection, and generally replied on mature
consideration that they rather thought we excelled;
in respect of the punctuality with which we arrived at
our stations, and the smoothness of our traveling. I
wish you could see what an American railroad is, in
some parts where I now have seen them. I won't say
I wish you could feel what it is, because that would be
an unchristian and savage aspiration. It is never inclosed,
or warded off. You walk down the main street<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
of a large town; and, slap-dash, headlong, pell-mell,
down the middle of the street, with pigs burrowing,
and boys flying kites and playing marbles, and men
smoking, and women talking, and children crawling,
close to the very rails, there comes tearing along a mad
locomotive with its train of cars, scattering a red-hot
shower of sparks (from its <i>wood</i> fire) in all directions;
screeching, hissing, yelling, and panting; and nobody
one atom more concerned than if it were a hundred
miles away. You cross a turnpike-road; and there is
no gate, no policeman, no signal&mdash;nothing to keep the
wayfarer or quiet traveler out of the way, but a wooden
arch on which is written, in great letters, 'Look out
for the locomotive.' And if any man, woman, or
child don't look out, why, it's his or her fault, and
there's an end of it.</p>

<p>"The cars are like very shabby omnibuses,&mdash;only
larger; holding sixty or seventy people. The seats,
instead of being placed long ways, are put cross-wise,
back to front. Each holds two. There is a long row
of these on each side of the caravan, and a narrow
passage up the centre. The windows are usually all
closed, and there is very often, in addition, a hot, close,
most intolerable charcoal stove in a red-hot glow. The
heat and closeness are quite insupportable. But this is
the characteristic of all American houses, of all the
public institutions, chapels, theatres, and prisons. From
the constant use of the hard anthracite coal in these
beastly furnaces, a perfectly new class of diseases is
springing up in the country. Their effect upon an
Englishman is briefly told. He is always very sick and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
very faint; and has an intolerable headache, morning,
noon, and night.</p>

<p>"In the ladies' car, there is no smoking of tobacco
allowed. All gentlemen who have ladies with them sit
in this car; and it is usually very full. Before it, is
the gentlemen's car; which is something narrower. As
I had a window close to me yesterday which commanded
this gentlemen's car, I looked at it pretty often, perforce.
The flashes of saliva flew so perpetually and
incessantly out of the windows all the way, that it
looked as though they were ripping open feather-beds
inside, and letting the wind dispose of the feathers.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
But this spitting is universal. In the courts of law,
the judge has his spittoon on the bench, the counsel
have theirs, the witness has his, the prisoner his, and
the crier his. The jury are accommodated at the rate
of three men to a spittoon (or spit-box as they call it
here); and the spectators in the gallery are provided
for, as so many men who in the course of nature expectorate
without cessation. There are spit-boxes in every
steamboat, bar-room, public dining-room, house of
office, and place of general resort, no matter what it
be. In the hospitals, the students are requested, by
placard, to use the boxes provided for them, and not
to spit upon the stairs. I have twice seen gentlemen,
at evening parties in New York, turn aside when they
were not engaged in conversation, and spit upon the
drawing-room carpet. And in every bar-room and
hotel passage the stone floor looks as if it were paved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
with open oysters&mdash;from the quantity of this kind of
deposit which tessellates it all over.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"The institutions at Boston, and at Hartford, are
most admirable. It would be very difficult indeed to
improve upon them. But this is not so at New York;
where there is an ill-managed lunatic asylum, a bad
jail, a dismal workhouse, and a perfectly intolerable
place of police-imprisonment. A man is found drunk
in the streets, and is thrown into a cell below the surface
of the earth; profoundly dark; so full of noisome
vapors that when you enter it with a candle you see a
ring about the light, like that which surrounds the
moon in wet and cloudy weather; and so offensive and
disgusting in its filthy odors that you <i>cannot bear</i> its
stench. He is shut up within an iron door, in a series
of vaulted passages where no one stays; has no drop
of water, or ray of light, or visitor, or help of any
kind; and there he remains until the magistrate's
arrival. If he die (as one man did not long ago), he
is half eaten by the rats in an hour's time (as this man
was). I expressed, on seeing these places the other
night, the disgust I felt, and which it would be impossible
to repress. 'Well, I don't know,' said the night
constable&mdash;that's a national answer, by-the-by,&mdash;'well,
I don't know. I've had six-and-twenty young women
locked up here together, and beautiful ones too, and
that's a fact.' The cell was certainly no larger than
the wine-cellar in Devonshire Terrace; at least three
feet lower; and stunk like a common sewer. There
was one woman in it then. The magistrate begins his
examinations at five o'clock in the morning; the watch
is set at seven at night; if the prisoners have been given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
in charge by an officer, they are not taken out before
nine or ten; and in the interval they remain in these
places, where they could no more be heard to cry for
help, in case of a fit or swoon among them, than a
man's voice could be heard after he was coffined up in
his grave.</p>

<p>"There is a prison in this same city, and indeed in
the same building, where prisoners for grave offenses
await their trial, and to which they are sent back when
under remand. It sometimes happens that a man or
woman will remain here for twelve months, waiting the
result of motions for new trial, and in arrest of judgment,
and what not. I went into it the other day:
without any notice or preparation, otherwise I find it
difficult to catch them in their work-a-day aspect. I
stood in a long, high, narrow building, consisting of
four galleries one above the other, with a bridge across
each, on which sat a turnkey, sleeping or reading as
the case might be. From the roof, a couple of wind-sails
dangled and drooped, limp and useless; the sky-light
being fast closed, and they only designed for
summer use. In the centre of the building was the
eternal stove; and along both sides of every gallery
was a long row of iron doors&mdash;looking like furnace-doors,
being very small, but black and cold as if the
fires within had gone out.</p>

<p>"A man with keys appears, to show us round. A
good-looking fellow, and, in his way, civil and obliging."
(I omit a dialogue of which the substance has
been printed,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and give only that which appears for
the first time here.)</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>
<p>"'Suppose a man's here for twelve months. Do you
mean to say he never comes out at that little iron
door?'</p>

<p>"'He <i>may</i> walk some, perhaps&mdash;not much.'</p>

<p>"'Will you show me a few of them?'</p>

<p>"'Ah! All, if you like.'</p>

<p>"He threw open a door, and I looked in. An old
man was sitting on his bed, reading. The light came
in through a small chink, very high up in the wall.
Across the room ran a thick iron pipe to carry off
filth; this was bored for the reception of something
like a big funnel in shape; and over the funnel was a
watercock. This was his washing apparatus and water-closet.
It was not savory, but not very offensive. He
looked up at me; gave himself an odd, dogged kind
of shake; and fixed his eyes on his book again. I
came out, and the door was shut and locked. He had
been there a month, and would have to wait another
month for his trial. 'Has he ever walked out now,
for instance?' 'No.'&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"'In England, if a man is under sentence of death
even, he has a yard to walk in at certain times.'</p>

<p>"'Possible?'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Making me this answer with a coolness which
is perfectly untranslatable and inexpressible, and which
is quite peculiar to the soil, he took me to the women's
side, telling me, upon the way, all about this man, who,
it seems, murdered his wife, and will certainly be hanged.
The women's doors have a small square aperture in
them; I looked through one, and saw a pretty boy
about ten or twelve years old, who seemed lonely and
miserable enough&mdash;as well he might. 'What's <i>he</i> been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
doing?' says I. 'Nothing,' says my friend. 'Nothing!'
says I. 'No,' says he. 'He's here for safe keeping.
He saw his father kill his mother, and is detained to
give evidence against him&mdash;that was his father you saw
just now.' 'But that's rather hard treatment for a
witness, isn't it?' 'Well, I don't know. It a'n't a
very rowdy life, and <i>that's</i> a fact.' So my friend, who
was an excellent fellow in his way, and very obliging,
and a handsome young man to boot, took me off to
show me some more curiosities; and I was very much
obliged to him, for the place was so hot, and I so
giddy, that I could scarcely stand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"When a man is hanged in New York, he is walked
out of one of these cells, without any condemned sermon
or other religious formalities, straight into the
narrow jail-yard, which may be about the width of
Cranbourn Alley. There, a gibbet is erected, which
is of curious construction; for the culprit stands on the
earth with the rope about his neck, which passes through
a pulley in the top of the 'Tree' (see <i>Newgate Calendar</i>
passim), and is attached to a weight something heavier
than the man. This weight, being suddenly let go,
drags the rope down with it, and sends the criminal
flying up fourteen feet into the air; while the judge, and
jury, and five-and-twenty citizens (whose presence is
required by the law), stand by, that they may afterwards
certify to the fact. This yard is a very dismal place;
and when I looked at it, I thought the practice infinitely
superior to ours: much more solemn, and far less degrading
and indecent.</p>

<p>"There is another prison near New York which is a
house of correction. The convicts labor in stone-quarries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
near at hand, but the jail has no covered yards or
shops, so that when the weather is wet (as it was when
I was there) each man is shut up in his own little cell,
all the live-long day. These cells, in all the correction-houses
I have seen, are on one uniform plan,&mdash;thus:
<span class="smcap">a, b, c</span>, and <span class="smcap">d</span>, are the walls of the building with windows
in them, high up in the wall. The shaded place
in the centre represents four tiers of cells, one above the
other, with doors of grated iron, and a light grated
gallery to each tier. Four tiers front to <span class="smcap">b</span>, and four to
<span class="smcap">d</span>, so that by this means you may be said, in walking
round, to see eight tiers in all. The intermediate blank
space you walk in, looking up at these galleries; so that,
coming in at the door <span class="smcap">e</span>, and going either to the right
or left till you come back to the door again, you see all
the cells under one roof and in one high room. Imagine
them in number 400, and in every one a man locked up;
this one with his hands through the bars of his grate,
this one in bed (in the middle of the day, remember),
and this one flung down in a heap upon the ground with
his head against the bars like a wild beast. Make the
rain pour down in torrents outside. Put the everlasting
stove in the midst; hot, suffocating, and vaporous, as a
witch's cauldron. Add a smell like that of a thousand
old mildewed umbrellas wet through, and a thousand
dirty-clothes-bags musty, moist, and fusty, and you will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
have some idea&mdash;a very feeble one, my dear friend, on
my word&mdash;of this place yesterday week. You know of
course that we adopted our improvements in prison-discipline
from the American pattern; but I am confident
that the writers who have the most lustily lauded the
American prisons have never seen Chesterton's domain
or Tracey's.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> There is no more comparison between
these two prisons of ours, and any I have seen here <span class="smcap">yet</span>,
than there is between the keepers here, and those two
gentlemen. Putting out of sight the difficulty we have
in England of finding <i>useful</i> labor for the prisoners
(which of course arises from our being an older country
and having vast numbers of artisans unemployed), our
system is more complete, more impressive, and more
satisfactory in every respect. It is very possible that I
have not come to the best, not having yet seen Mount
Auburn. I will tell you when I have. And also when
I have come to those inns, mentioned&mdash;vaguely rather&mdash;by
Miss Martineau, where they undercharge literary
people for the love the landlords bear them. My experience,
so far, has been of establishments where (perhaps
for the same reason) they very monstrously and
violently overcharge a man whose position forbids remonstrance.</p>


<div class='date'><br />
"<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, Sunday, March the Thirteenth, 1842.<br />
</div>

<p>"In allusion to the last sentence, my dear friend, I
must tell you a slight experience I had in Philadelphia.
My rooms had been ordered for a week, but, in consequence
of Kate's illness, only Mr. Q. and the luggage
had gone on. Mr. Q. always lives at the table-d'h&ocirc;te,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
so that while we were in New York our rooms were
empty. The landlord not only charged me half the
full rent for the time during which the rooms were reserved
for us (which was quite right), but charged me
also <i>for board for myself and Kate and Anne, at the rate
of nine dollars per day</i> for the same period, when we
were actually living, at the same expense, in New
York!!! I <i>did</i> remonstrate upon this head, but was
coolly told it was the custom (which I have since been
assured is a lie), and had nothing for it but to pay the
amount. What else could I do? I was going away by
the steamboat at five o'clock in the morning; and the
landlord knew perfectly well that my disputing an item
of his bill would draw down upon me the sacred wrath
of the newspapers, which would one and all demand in
capitals if <span class="smcap">this</span> was the gratitude of the man whom
America had received as she had never received any
other man but La Fayette?</p>

<p>"I went last Tuesday to the Eastern Penitentiary
near Philadelphia, which is the only prison in the States,
or I believe in the world, on the principle of hopeless,
strict, and unrelaxed solitary confinement, during the
whole term of the sentence. It is wonderfully kept,
but a most dreadful, fearful place. The inspectors,
immediately on my arrival in Philadelphia, invited me
to pass the day in the jail, and to dine with them when
I had finished my inspection, that they might hear my
opinion of the system. Accordingly I passed the whole
day in going from cell to cell, and conversing with the
prisoners. Every facility was given me, and no constraint
whatever imposed upon any man's free speech.
If I were to write you a letter of twenty sheets, I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
not tell you this one day's work; so I will reserve it
until that happy time when we shall sit round the table
a Jack Straw's&mdash;you, and I, and Mac&mdash;and go over
my diary. I never shall be able to dismiss from my
mind the impressions of that day. Making notes of
them, as I have done, is an absurdity, for they are
written, beyond all power of erasure, in my brain. I
saw men who had been there, five years, six years,
eleven years, two years, two months, two days; some
whose term was nearly over, and some whose term had
only just begun. Women too, under the same variety
of circumstances. Every prisoner who comes into the
jail comes at night; is put into a bath, and dressed in
the prison-garb; and then a black hood is drawn over
his face and head, and he is led to the cell from which
he never stirs again until his whole period of confinement
has expired. I looked at some of them with the
same awe as I should have looked at men who had been
buried alive and dug up again.</p>

<p>"We dined in the jail: and I told them after dinner
how much the sight had affected me, and what an awful
punishment it was. I dwelt upon this; for, although
the inspectors are extremely kind and benevolent men,
I question whether they are sufficiently acquainted with
the human mind to know what it is they are doing.
Indeed, I am sure they do not know. I bore testimony,
as every one who sees it must, to the admirable
government of the institution (Stanfield is the keeper:
grown a little younger, that's all); but added that nothing
could justify such a punishment but its working
a reformation in the prisoners. That for short terms&mdash;say
two years for the maximum&mdash;I conceived, especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
after what they had told me of its good effects in certain
cases, it might perhaps be highly beneficial; but
that, carried to so great an extent, I thought it cruel
and unjustifiable; and, further, that their sentences for
small offenses were very rigorous, not to say savage.
All this they took like men who were really anxious to
have one's free opinion and to do right. And we were
very much pleased with each other, and parted in the
friendliest way.</p>

<p>"They sent me back to Philadelphia in a carriage
they had sent for me in the morning; and then I had
to dress in a hurry, and follow Kate to Carey's the
bookseller's, where there was a party. He married a
sister of Leslie's. There are three Miss Leslies here,
very accomplished; and one of them has copied all
her brother's principal pictures. These copies hang
about the room. We got away from this as soon as we
could; and next morning had to turn out at five. In
the morning I had received and shaken hands with five
hundred people, so you may suppose that I was pretty
well tired. Indeed, I am obliged to be very careful of
myself; to avoid smoking and drinking; to get to bed
soon; and to be particular in respect of what I eat.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You cannot think how bilious and trying the climate
is. One day it is hot summer, without a breath of air;
the next, twenty degrees below freezing, with a wind
blowing that cuts your skin like steel. These changes
have occurred here several times since last Wednesday
night.</p>

<p>"I have altered my route, and don't mean to go to
Charleston. The country, all the way from here, is
nothing but a dismal swamp; there is a bad night of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
sea-coasting in the journey; the equinoctial gales are
blowing hard; and Clay (a most <i>charming</i> fellow, by-the-by),
whom I have consulted, strongly dissuades me.
The weather is intensely hot there; the spring fever is
coming on; and there is very little to see, after all.
We therefore go next Wednesday night to Richmond,
which we shall reach on Thursday. There we shall
stop three days; my object being to see some tobacco-plantations.
Then we shall go by James River back to
Baltimore, which we have already passed through, and
where we shall stay two days. Then we shall go West
at once, straight through the most gigantic part of this
continent: across the Alleghany Mountains, and over
a prairie.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Still at Washington</span>, Fifteenth March, 1842.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It is impossible, my dear friend, to tell you what we
felt when Mr. Q. (who is a fearfully sentimental
genius, but heartily interested in all that concerns us)
came to where we were dining last Sunday, and sent
in a note to the effect that the Caledonia<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> had
arrived! Being really assured of her safety, we felt as
if the distance between us and home were diminished
by at least one-half. There was great joy everywhere
here, for she had been quite despaired of, but our joy
was beyond all telling. This news came on by express.
Last night your letters reached us. I was
dining with a club (for I can't avoid a dinner of that
sort, now and then), and Kate sent me a note about
nine o'clock to say they were here. But she didn't
open them&mdash;which I consider heroic&mdash;until I came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
home. That was about half-past ten; and we read
them until nearly two in the morning.</p>

<p>"I won't say a word about your letters; except that
Kate and I have come to a conclusion which makes
me tremble in my shoes, for we decide that humorous
narrative is your forte, and not statesmen of the commonwealth.
I won't say a word about your news;
for how could I in that case, while you want to hear
what we are doing, resist the temptation of expending
pages on those darling children?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"I have the privilege of appearing on the floor of
both Houses here, and go to them every day. They
are very handsome and commodious. There is a great
deal of bad speaking, but there are a great many very
remarkable men, in the legislature: such as John
Quincy Adams, Clay, Preston, Calhoun, and others:
with whom I need scarcely add I have been placed
in the friendliest relations. Adams is a fine old
fellow&mdash;seventy-six years old, but with most surprising
vigor, memory, readiness, and pluck. Clay is
perfectly enchanting; an irresistible man. There are
some very notable specimens, too, out of the West.
Splendid men to look at, hard to deceive, prompt to
act, lions in energy, Crichtons in varied accomplishments,
Indians in quickness of eye and gesture, Americans
in affectionate and generous impulse. It would
be difficult to exaggerate the nobility of some of these
glorious fellows.</p>

<p>"When Clay retires, as he does this month, Preston
will become the leader of the Whig party. He so
solemnly assures me that the international copyright
shall and will be passed, that I almost begin to hope;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
and I shall be entitled to say, if it be, that I have
brought it about. You have no idea how universal the
discussion of its merits and demerits has become, or
how eager for the change I have made a portion of the
people.</p>

<p>"You remember what &mdash;&mdash; was, in England. If
you <i>could</i> but see him here! If you could only have
seen him when he called on us the other day,&mdash;feigning
abstraction in the dreadful pressure of affairs of
state; rubbing his forehead as one who was aweary of
the world; and exhibiting a sublime caricature of Lord
Burleigh. He is the only thoroughly unreal man I
have seen on this side the ocean. Heaven help the
President! All parties are against him, and he appears
truly wretched. We go to a levee at his house
to-night. He has invited me to dinner on Friday, but
I am obliged to decline; for we leave, per steamboat,
to-morrow night.</p>

<p>"I said I wouldn't write anything more concerning
the American people, for two months. Second thoughts
are best. I shall not change, and may as well speak
out&mdash;to <i>you</i>. They are friendly, earnest, hospitable,
kind, frank, very often accomplished, far less prejudiced
than you would suppose, warm-hearted, fervent,
and enthusiastic. They are chivalrous in their universal
politeness to women, courteous, obliging, disinterested;
and, when they conceive a perfect affection
for a man (as I may venture to say of myself), entirely
devoted to him. I have received thousands of people
of all ranks and grades, and have never once been
asked an offensive or unpolite question,&mdash;except by
Englishmen, who, when they have been 'located' here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
for some years, are worse than the devil in his blackest
painting. The State is a parent to its people; has a
parental care and watch over all poor children, women
laboring of child, sick persons, and captives. The
common men render you assistance in the streets, and
would revolt from the offer of a piece of money. The
desire to oblige is universal; and I have never once
traveled in a public conveyance without making some
generous acquaintance whom I have been sorry to part
from, and who has in many cases come on miles, to see
us again. But I don't like the country. I would not
live here, on any consideration. It goes against the
grain with me. It would with you. I think it impossible,
utterly impossible, for any Englishman to live
here and be happy. I have a confidence that I must
be right, because I have everything, God knows, to
lead me to the opposite conclusion; and yet I cannot
resist coming to this one. As to the causes, they are
too many to enter upon here.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"One of two petitions for an international copyright
which I brought here from American authors, with
Irving at their head, has been presented to the House
of Representatives. Clay retains the other for presentation
to the Senate after I have left Washington. The
presented one has been referred to a committee; the
Speaker has nominated as its chairman Mr. Kennedy,
member for Baltimore, who is himself an author and
notoriously favorable to such a law; and I am going to
assist him in his report.</p>

</div>

<p>"Irving was with me at Washington yesterday, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
<i>wept heartily</i> at parting. He is a fine fellow, when you
know him well; and you would relish him, my dear
friend, of all things. We have laughed together at
some absurdities we have encountered in company,
quite in my vociferous Devonshire-Terrace style. The
'Merrikin' government has treated him, he says, most
liberally and handsomely in every respect. He thinks
of sailing for Liverpool on the 7th of April, passing a
short time in London, and then going to Paris. Perhaps
you may meet him. If you do, he will know
that you are my dearest friend, and will open his whole
heart to you at once. His secretary of legation, Mr.
Coggleswell, is a man of very remarkable information,
a great traveler, a good talker, and a scholar.</p>

<p>"I am going to sketch you our trip here from Washington,
as it involves nine miles of a 'Virginny Road.'
That done, I must be brief, good brother."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The reader of the <i>American Notes</i> will remember the
admirable and most humorous description of the night
steamer on the Potomac, and of the black driver over
the Virginia road. Both were in this letter; which,
after three days, he resumed "At Washington again,
Monday, March the twenty-first:</p>

<p>"We had intended to go to Baltimore from Richmond,
by a place called Norfolk; but, one of the boats
being under repair, I found we should probably be
detained at this Norfolk two days. Therefore we came
back here yesterday, by the road we had traveled
before; lay here last night; and go on to Baltimore
this afternoon, at four o'clock. It is a journey of only
two hours and a half. Richmond is a prettily situated
town, but, like other towns in slave districts (as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
planters themselves admit), has an aspect of decay and
gloom which to an unaccustomed eye is <i>most</i> distressing.
In the black car (for they don't let them sit with
the whites), on the railroad as we went there, were a
mother and family, whom the steamer was conveying
away, to sell; retaining the man (the husband and
father, I mean) on his plantation. The children cried
the whole way. Yesterday, on board the boat, a slave-owner
and two constables were our fellow-passengers.
They were coming here in search of two negroes who
had run away on the previous day. On the bridge at
Richmond there is a notice against fast driving over it,
as it is rotten and crazy: penalty&mdash;for whites, five dollars;
for slaves, fifteen stripes. My heart is lightened
as if a great load had been taken from it, when I think
that we are turning our backs on this accursed and
detested system. I really don't think I could have
borne it any longer. It is all very well to say 'be
silent on the subject.' They won't let you be silent.
They <i>will</i> ask you what you think of it; and <i>will</i>
expatiate on slavery as if it were one of the greatest
blessings of mankind. 'It's not,' said a hard, bad-looking
fellow to me the other day, 'it's not the interest
of a man to use his slaves ill. It's damned nonsense
that you hear in England.'&mdash;I told him quietly that it
was not a man's interest to get drunk, or to steal, or to
game, or to indulge in any other vice, but he <i>did</i>
indulge in it for all that; that cruelty, and the abuse
of irresponsible power, were two of the bad passions
of human nature, with the gratification of which, considerations
of interest or of ruin, had nothing whatever
to do; and that, while every candid man must admit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
that even a slave might be happy enough with a good
master, all human beings knew that bad masters, cruel
masters, and masters who disgraced the form they bore,
were matters of experience and history, whose existence
was as undisputed as that of slaves themselves. He
was a little taken aback by this, and asked me if I
believed in the Bible. Yes, I said, but if any man
could prove to me that it sanctioned slavery, I would
place no further credence in it. 'Well then,' he said,
'by God, sir, the niggers must be kept down, and the
whites have put down the colored people wherever they
have found them.' 'That's the whole question,' said
I. 'Yes, and by God,' says he, 'the British had better
not stand out on that point when Lord Ashburton
comes over, for I never felt so warlike as I do now,&mdash;and
that's a fact.' I was obliged to accept a public
supper in this Richmond, and I saw plainly enough
there that the hatred which these Southern States bear
to us as a nation has been fanned up and revived again
by this Creole business, and can scarcely be exaggerated.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "We were desperately tired at Richmond, as
we went to a great many places and received a very
great number of visitors. We appoint usually two
hours in every day for this latter purpose, and have our
room so full at that period that it is difficult to move
or breathe. Before we left Richmond, a gentleman
told me, when I really was so exhausted that I could
hardly stand, that 'three people of great fashion' were
much offended by having been told, when they called
last evening, that I was tired and not visible, then, but
would be 'at home' from twelve to two next day!
Another gentleman (no doubt of great fashion also)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
sent a letter to me two hours after I had gone to bed,
preparatory to rising at four next morning, with instructions
to the slave who brought it to knock me up
and wait for an answer!</p>

<p>"I am going to break my resolution of accepting
no more public entertainments, in favor of the originators
of the printed document overleaf. They live upon
the confines of the Indian territory, some two thousand
miles or more west of New York! Think of my dining
there! And yet, please God, the festival will come
off&mdash;I should say about the 12th or 15th of next
month."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The printed document was a series of resolutions,
moved at a public meeting attended by all the principal
citizens, judges, professors, and doctors of St.
Louis, urgently inviting to that city of the Far West
the distinguished writer then the guest of America,
eulogizing his genius, and tendering to him their
warmest hospitalities. He was at Baltimore when he
closed his letter.</p>

<p>"I have a great diffidence in running counter to any
impression formed by a man of Maclise's genius, on a
subject he has fully considered." (Referring, apparently,
to some remark by myself on the picture of the
Play-scene in <i>Hamlet</i>, exhibited this year.) "But I
quite agree with you about the King in <i>Hamlet</i>. Talking
of Hamlet, I constantly carry in my great-coat
pocket the <i>Shakspeare</i> you bought for me in Liverpool.
What an unspeakable source of delight that book is
to me!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your Ontario letter I found here to-night: sent on
by the vigilant and faithful Colden, who makes every
thing having reference to us or our affairs a labor of the
heartiest love. We devoured its contents, greedily.
Good Heaven, my dear fellow, how I miss you! and
how I count the time 'twixt this and coming home
again! Shall I ever forget the day of our parting at
Liverpool! when even &mdash;&mdash; became jolly and radiant
in his sympathy with our separation! Never, never
shall I forget that time. Ah! how seriously I thought
then, and how seriously I have thought many, many
times since, of the terrible folly of ever quarreling with
a true friend, on good-for-nothing trifles! Every little
hasty word that has ever passed between us rose up before
me like a reproachful ghost. At this great distance,
I seem to look back upon any miserable small interruption
of our affectionate intercourse, though only for the
instant it has never outlived, with a sort of pity for
myself as if I were another creature.</p>

<p>"I have bought another accordion. The steward
lent me one, on the passage out, and I regaled the ladies'
cabin with my performances. You can't think with
what feeling I play <i>Home Sweet Home</i> every night, or
how pleasantly sad it makes us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And so God bless
you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I leave space for a short postscript before
sealing this, but it will probably contain nothing. The
dear, dear children! what a happiness it is to know
that they are in such hands!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would not be possible that a more vivid or exact
impression than that which is derivable from these
letters could be given of either the genius or the character
of the writer. The whole man is here in the
supreme hour of his life, and in all the enjoyment of
its highest sensations. Inexpressibly sad to me has
been the task of going over them, but the surprise has
equaled the sadness. I had forgotten what was in
them. That they contained, in their first vividness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
all the most prominent descriptions of his published
book, I knew. But the reproduction of any part of
these was not permissible here; and, believing that the
substance of them had been thus almost wholly embodied
in the <i>American Notes</i>, when they were lent to
assist in its composition, I turned to them with very
small expectation of finding anything available for
present use. Yet the difficulty has been, not to find,
but to reject; and the rejection when most unavoidable
has not been most easy. Even where the subjects
recur that are in the printed volume, there is a freshness
of first impressions in the letters that renders it
no small trial to act strictly on the rule adhered to in
these extracts from them. In the <i>Notes</i> there is of
course very much, masterly in observation and description,
of which there is elsewhere no trace; but the
passages amplified from the letters have not been improved,
and the manly force and directness of some
of their views and reflections, conveyed by touches of
a picturesque completeness that no elaboration could
give, have here and there not been strengthened by
rhetorical additions in the printed work. There is
also a charm in the letters which the plan adopted in
the book necessarily excluded from it. It will always,
of course, have value as a deliberate expression of the
results gathered from the American experiences, but
the <i>personal narrative</i> of this famous visit to America
is in the letters alone. In what way his experiences
arose, the desire at the outset to see nothing that was
not favorable, the slowness with which adverse impressions
were formed, and the eager recognition of every
truthful and noble quality that arose and remained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
above the fault-finding, are discoverable only in the
letters.</p>

<p>Already it is manifest from them that the before-mentioned
disappointments, as well of the guest in his
entertainers as of the entertainers in their guest, had
their beginning in the copyright differences; but it is
not less plain that the social dissatisfactions on his side
were of even earlier date, and with the country itself
had certainly nothing to do. It was objected to him,
I well remember, that in making such unfavorable remarks
as his published book did on many points, he
was assailing the democratic institutions that had formed
the character of the nation; but the answer is obvious,
that, democratic institutions being universal in America,
they were as fairly entitled to share in the good as
in the bad; and in what he praised, of which there is
here abundant testimony, he must be held to have exalted
those institutions as much, as in what he blamed
he could be held to depreciate them. He never sets
himself up in judgment on the entire people. As we
see, from the way the letters show us that the opinions
he afterwards published were formed, he does not draw
conclusions while his observation is only half concluded;
and he refrains throughout from the example
too strongly set him, even in the very terms of his welcome
by the writers of America,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> of flinging one nation
in the other's face. He leaves each upon its own ground.
His great business in his publication, as in the first impressions
recorded here, is to exhibit social influences
at work as he saw them himself; and it would surely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
have been of all bad compliments the worst, when resolving,
in the tone and with the purpose of a friend,
to make public what he had observed in America, if
he had supposed that such a country would take truth
amiss.</p>

<p>There is, however, one thing to be especially remembered,
as well in reading the letters as in judging of the
book which was founded on them. It is a point to
which I believe Mr. Emerson directed the attention of
his countrymen. Everything of an objectionable kind,
whether the author would have it so or not, stands out
more prominently and distinctly than matter of the
opposite description. The social sin is a more tangible
thing than the social virtue. Pertinaciously to insist
upon the charities and graces of life, is to outrage their
quiet and unobtrusive character; but we incur the
danger of extending the vulgarities and indecencies if
we seem to countenance by omitting to expose them.
And if this is only kept in view in reading what is here
given, the proportion of censure will be found not to
overbalance the just admiration and unexaggerated
praise.</p>

<p>Apart from such considerations, it is to be also said,
the letters, from which I am now printing exactly as
they were written, have claims, as mere literature, of
an unusual kind. Unrivaled quickness of observation,
the rare faculty of seizing out of a multitude of things
the thing only that is essential, the irresistible play of
humor, such pathos as only humorists of this high
order possess, and the unwearied unforced vivacity of
ever fresh, buoyant, bounding animal spirits, never
found more natural, variously easy, or picturesque expression.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
Written amid such distraction, fatigue, and
weariness as they describe, amid the jarring noises of
hotels and streets, aboard steamers, on canal-boats,
and in log huts, there is not an erasure in them. Not
external objects only, but feelings, reflections, and
thoughts, are photographed into visible forms with the
same unexampled ease. They borrow no help from
the matters of which they treat. They would have
given, to the subjects described, old acquaintance and
engrossing interest if they had been about a people in
the moon. Of the personal character at the same time
self-portrayed, others, whose emotions it less vividly
awakens, will judge more calmly and clearly than myself.
Yet to myself only can it be known how small
were the services of friendship that sufficed to rouse all
the sensibilities of this beautiful and noble nature.
Throughout our life-long intercourse it was the same.
His keenness of discrimination failed him never excepting
here, when it was lost in the limitless extent
of his appreciation of all kindly things; and never did
he receive what was meant for a benefit that he was not
eager to return it a hundredfold. No man more truly
generous ever lived.</p>

<p>His next letter was begun from "on board the canal-boat.
Going to Pittsburgh. Monday, March twenty-eighth,
1842;" and the difficulties of rejection, to
which reference has just been made, have been nowhere
felt by me so much. Several of the descriptive masterpieces
of the book are in it, with such touches of original
freshness as might fairly have justified a reproduction
of them in their first form. Among these are the
Harrisburg coach on its way through the Susquehanna<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
valley; the railroad across the mountain; the brown-forester
of the Mississippi, the interrogative man in
pepper-and-salt, and the affecting scene of the emigrants
put ashore as the steamer passes up the Ohio. But all
that I may here give, bearing any resemblance to what
is given in the <i>Notes</i>, are the opening sketch of the
small creature on the top of the queer stage-coach, to
which the printed version fails to do adequate justice,
and an experience to which the interest belongs of
having suggested the settlement of Eden in <i>Martin
Chuzzlewit</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "We left Baltimore last Thursday,
the twenty-fourth, at half-past eight in the morning, by
railroad; and got to a place called York, about twelve.
There we dined, and took a stage-coach for Harrisburg;
twenty-five miles further. This stage-coach was like
nothing so much as the body of one of the swings you
see at a fair set upon four wheels and roofed and covered
at the sides with painted canvas. There were
twelve <i>inside!</i> I, thank my stars, was on the box.
The luggage was on the roof; among it, a good-sized
dining-table, and a big rocking-chair. We also took
up an intoxicated gentleman, who sat for ten miles
between me and the coachman; and another intoxicated
gentleman who got up behind, but in the course of a
mile or two fell off without hurting himself, and was
seen in the distant perspective reeling back to the grog-shop
where we had found him. There were four horses
to this land-ark, of course; but we did not perform
the journey until after half-past six o'clock that night.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The first half of the journey was tame enough,
but the second lay through the valley of the Susquehanah
(I think I spell it right, but I haven't that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
American Geography at hand), which is very beautiful.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"I think I formerly made a casual remark to you
touching the precocity of the youth of this country.
When we changed horses on this journey I got down
to stretch my legs, refresh myself with a glass of
whiskey-and-water, and shake the wet off my great-coat,&mdash;for
it was raining very heavily, and continued to
do so, all night. Mounting to my seat again, I observed
something lying on the roof of the coach, which I took
to be a rather large fiddle in a brown bag. In the
course of ten miles or so, however, I discovered that it
had a pair of dirty shoes at one end, and a glazed cap
at the other; and further observation demonstrated it
to be a small boy, in a snuff-colored coat, with his arms
quite pinioned to his sides by deep forcing into his
pockets. He was, I presume, a relative or friend of the
coachman's, as he lay atop of the luggage, with his
face towards the rain; and, except when a change of
position brought his shoes in contact with my hat, he
appeared to be asleep. Sir, when we stopped to water
the horses, about two miles from Harrisburg, this thing
slowly upreared itself to the height of three foot eight,
and, fixing its eyes on me with a mingled expression
of complacency, patronage, national independence,
and sympathy for all outer barbarians and foreigners,
said, in shrill piping accents, 'Well now, stranger, I
guess you find this a'most like an English a'ternoon,&mdash;hey?'
It is unnecessary to add that I thirsted for his
blood.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"We had all next morning in Harrisburg, as the
canal-boat was not to start until three o'clock in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
afternoon. The officials called upon me before I had
finished breakfast; and, as the town is the seat of the
Pennsylvanian legislature, I went up to the Capitol. I
was very much interested in looking over a number of
treaties made with the poor Indians, their signatures
being rough drawings of the creatures or weapons they
are called after; and the extraordinary drawing of
these emblems, showing the queer, unused, shaky manner
in which each man has held the pen, struck me
very much.</p>

<p>"You know my small respect for our House of Commons.
These local legislatures are too insufferably
apish of mighty legislation, to be seen without bile;
for which reason, and because a great crowd of senators
and ladies had assembled in both houses to behold the
inimitable, and had already begun to pour in upon
him even in the secretary's private room, I went back
to the hotel, with all speed. The members of both
branches of the legislature followed me there, however,
so we had to hold the usual levee before our half-past
one o'clock dinner. We received a great number of
them. Pretty nearly every man spat upon the carpet,
as usual; and one blew his nose with his fingers,&mdash;also
on the carpet, which was a very neat one, the room
given up to us being the private parlor of the landlord's
wife. This has become so common since, however,
that it scarcely seems worth mentioning. Please to
observe that the gentleman in question was a member
of the senate, which answers (as they very often tell
me) to our House of Lords.</p>

<p>"The innkeeper was the most attentive, civil, and
obliging person I ever saw in my life. On being asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
for his bill, he said there was no bill: the honor and
pleasure, etc. being more than sufficient.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> I did not
permit this, of course, and begged Mr. Q. to explain
to him that, traveling four strong, I could not hear of
it on any account.</p>

<p>"And now I come to the Canal-Boat. Bless your heart
and soul, my dear fellow,&mdash;if you could only see us on
board the canal-boat! Let me think, for a moment, at
what time of the day or night I should best like you to
see us. In the morning? Between five and six in the
morning, shall I say? Well! you <i>would</i> like to see me,
standing on the deck, fishing the dirty water out of the
canal with a tin ladle chained to the boat by a long
chain; pouring the same into a tin basin (also chained
up in like manner); and scrubbing my face with the
jack towel. At night, shall I say? I don't know that
you <i>would</i> like to look into the cabin at night, only to
see me lying on a temporary shelf exactly the width of
this sheet of paper when it's open (<i>I measured it this
morning</i>),<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> with one man above me, and another below;
and, in all, eight-and-twenty in a low cabin, which
you can't stand upright in with your hat on. I don't
think you would like to look in at breakfast-time either,
for then these shelves have only just been taken down
and put away, and the atmosphere of the place is, as
you may suppose, by no means fresh; though there <i>are</i>
upon the table tea and coffee, and bread and butter,
and salmon, and shad, and liver, and steak, and potatoes,
and pickles, and ham, and pudding, and sausages;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and three-and-thirty people sitting round it, eating and
drinking; and savory bottles of gin, and whiskey, and
brandy, and rum, in the bar hard by; and seven-and-twenty
out of the eight-and-twenty men, in foul linen,
with yellow streams from half-chewed tobacco trickling
down their chins. Perhaps the best time for you to
take a peep would be the present: eleven o'clock in
the forenoon: when the barber is at his shaving, and
the gentlemen are lounging about the stove waiting for
their turns, and not more than seventeen are spitting
in concert, and two or three are walking overhead
(lying down on the luggage every time the man at the
helm calls 'Bridge!'), and I am writing this in the
ladies' cabin, which is a part of the gentlemen's, and
only screened off by a red curtain. Indeed, it exactly
resembles the dwarf's private apartment in a caravan
at a fair; and the gentlemen, generally, represent the
spectators at a penny a head. The place is just as clean
and just as large as that caravan you and I were in at
Greenwich Fair last past. Outside, it is exactly like
any canal-boat you have seen near the Regent's Park,
or elsewhere.</p>

<p>"You never can conceive what the hawking and
spitting is, the whole night through. Last night was
the worst. <i>Upon my honor and word</i> I was obliged,
this morning, to lay my fur coat on the deck, and wipe
the half-dried flakes of spittle from it with my handkerchief;
and the only surprise seemed to be that I
should consider it necessary to do so. When I turned
in last night, I put it on a stool beside me, and there
it lay, under a cross-fire from five men,&mdash;three opposite,
one above, and one below. I make no complaints, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
show no disgust. I am looked upon as highly facetious
at night, for I crack jokes with everybody near me until
we fall asleep. I am considered very hardy in the
morning, for I run up, bare-necked, and plunge my
head into the half-frozen water, by half-past five o'clock.
I am respected for my activity, inasmuch as I jump from
the boat to the towing-path, and walk five or six miles
before breakfast; keeping up with the horses all the
time. In a word, they are quite astonished to find a
sedentary Englishman roughing it so well, and taking
so much exercise; and question me very much on that
head. The greater part of the men will sit and shiver
round the stove all day, rather than put one foot before
the other. As to having a window open, that's not to
be thought of.</p>

<p>"We expect to reach Pittsburgh to-night, between
eight and nine o'clock; and there we ardently hope to
find your March letters awaiting us. We have had,
with the exception of Friday afternoon, exquisite
weather, but cold. Clear starlight and moonlight
nights. The canal has run, for the most part, by the
side of the Susquehanah and Iwanata rivers; and has
been carried through tremendous obstacles. Yesterday
we crossed the mountain. This is done <i>by railroad</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You dine at an inn upon the mountain; and, including
the half-hour allowed for the meal, are rather
more than five hours performing this strange part of the
journey. The people north and 'down east' have terrible
legends of its danger; but they appear to be exceedingly
careful, and don't go to work at all wildly.
There are some queer precipices close to the rails, certainly;
but every precaution is taken, I am inclined to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
think, that such difficulties, and such a vast work, will
admit of.</p>

<p>"The scenery, before you reach the mountains, and
when you are on them, and after you have left them,
is very grand and fine; and the canal winds its way
through some deep, sullen gorges, which, seen by moonlight,
are very impressive: though immeasurably inferior
to Glencoe, to whose terrors I have not seen the
smallest <i>approach</i>. We have passed, both in the mountains
and elsewhere, a great number of new settlements
and detached log houses. Their utterly forlorn and
miserable appearance baffles all description. I have not
seen six cabins out of six hundred, where the windows
have been whole. Old hats, old clothes, old boards,
old fragments of blanket and paper, are stuffed into the
broken glass; and their air is misery and desolation.
It pains the eye to see the stumps of great trees thickly
strewn in every field of wheat; and never to lose the
eternal swamp and dull morass, with hundreds of rotten
trunks, of elm and pine and sycamore and logwood,
steeped in its unwholesome water; where the frogs so
croak at night that after dark there is an incessant
sound as if millions of phantom teams, with bells, were
traveling through the upper air, at an enormous distance
off. It is quite an oppressive circumstance, too,
to <i>come</i> upon great tracks, where settlers have been
burning down the trees; and where their wounded
bodies lie about, like those of murdered creatures;
while here and there some charred and blackened giant
rears two bare arms aloft, and seems to curse his enemies.
The prettiest sight I have seen was yesterday,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
when we&mdash;on the heights of the mountain, and in a
keen wind&mdash;looked down into a valley full of light and
softness; catching glimpses of scattered cabins; children
running to the doors; dogs bursting out to bark;
pigs scampering home, like so many prodigal sons;
families sitting out in their gardens; cows gazing upward,
with a stupid indifference; men in their shirt-sleeves,
looking on at their unfinished houses, and
planning work for to-morrow;&mdash;and the train riding
on, high above them, like a storm. But I know this is
beautiful&mdash;very&mdash;very beautiful!</p>

<p>"I wonder whether you and Mac mean to go to
Greenwich Fair! Perhaps you dine at the Crown and
Sceptre to-day, for it's Easter-Monday&mdash;who knows!
I wish you drank punch, dear Forster. It's a shabby
thing, not to be able to picture you with that cool
green glass.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"I told you of the many uses of the word 'fix.' I
ask Mr. Q. on board a steamboat if breakfast be nearly
ready, and he tells me yes he should think so, for when
he was last below the steward was 'fixing the tables'&mdash;in
other words, laying the cloth. When we have been
writing, and I beg him (do you remember anything of
my love of order, at this distance of time?) to collect
our papers, he answers that he'll 'fix 'em presently.'
So when a man's dressing he's 'fixing' himself, and
when you put yourself under a doctor he 'fixes' you in
no time. T'other night, before we came on board here,
when I had ordered a bottle of mulled claret and waited
some time for it, it was put on table with an apology
from the landlord (a lieutenant-colonel) that 'he feared
it wasn't fixed properly.' And here, on Saturday morning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
a Western man, handing the potatoes to Mr. Q.
at breakfast, inquired if he wouldn't take some of 'these
fixings' with his meat. I remained as grave as a judge.
I catch them looking at me sometimes, and feel that
they think I don't take any notice. Politics are very
high here; dreadfully strong; handbills, denunciations,
invectives, threats, and quarrels. The question is, who
shall be the next President. The election comes off in
<i>three years and a half</i> from this time."</p>

<p>He resumed his letter, "on board the steamboat from
Pittsburgh to Cincinnati, April the 1st, 1842. A very
tremulous steamboat, which makes my hand shake.
This morning, my dear friend, this very morning, which,
passing by without bringing news from England, would
have seen us on our way to St. Louis (vi&acirc; Cincinnati
and Louisville) with sad hearts and dejected countenances,
and the prospect of remaining for at least three
weeks longer without any intelligence of those so inexpressibly
dear to us&mdash;this very morning, bright and
lucky morning that it was, a great packet was brought
to our bedroom door, from HOME. How I have read
and re-read your affectionate, hearty, interesting, funny,
serious, delightful, and thoroughly Forsterian Columbia
letter, I will not attempt to tell you; or how glad I am
that you liked my first; or how afraid I am that my
second was not written in such good spirits as it should
have been; or how glad I am again to think that my
third <i>was;</i> or how I hope you will find some amusement
from my fourth: this present missive. All this,
and more affectionate and earnest words than the post-office
would convey at any price, though they have no
sharp edges to hurt the stamping-clerk&mdash;you will understand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
I know, without expression, or attempt at expression.
So, having got over the first agitation of so
much pleasure; and having walked the deck; and
being now in the cabin, where one party are playing at
chess, and another party are asleep, and another are
talking round the stove, and all are spitting; and a
persevering bore of a horrible New Englander with a
droning voice like a gigantic bee <i>will</i> sit down beside
me, though I am writing, and talk incessantly, in my
very ear, to Kate; here goes again.</p>

<p>"Let me see. I should tell you, first, that we got to
Pittsburgh between eight and nine o'clock of the evening
of the day on which I left off at the top of this
sheet; and were there received by a little man (a very
little man) whom I knew years ago in London. He
rejoiceth in the name of D. G.; and, when I knew him,
was in partnership with his father on the Stock-Exchange,
and lived handsomely at Dalston. They failed
in business soon afterwards, and then this little man
began to turn to account what had previously been his
amusement and accomplishment, by painting little
subjects for the fancy shops. So I lost sight of him,
nearly ten years ago; and here he turned up t'other
day, as a portrait-painter in Pittsburgh! He had
previously written me a letter which moved me a good
deal, by a kind of quiet independence and contentment
it breathed, and still a painful sense of being alone, so
very far from home. I received it in Philadelphia, and
answered it. He dined with us every day of our stay
in Pittsburgh (they were only three), and was truly
gratified and delighted to find me unchanged,&mdash;more
so than I can tell you. I am very glad to-night to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
think how much happiness we have fortunately been
able to give him.</p>

<p>"Pittsburgh is like Birmingham&mdash;at least its townsfolks
say so; and I didn't contradict them. It is, in
one respect. There is a great deal of smoke in it. I
quite offended a man at our yesterday's levee, who
supposed I was 'now quite at home,' by telling him
that the notion of London being so dark a place was a
popular mistake. We had very queer customers at our
receptions, I do assure you. Not least among them, a
gentleman with his inexpressibles imperfectly buttoned
and his waistband resting on his thighs, who stood
behind the half-opened door, and could by no temptation
or inducement be prevailed upon to come out.
There was also another gentleman, with one eye and
one fixed gooseberry, who stood in a corner, motionless
like an eight-day clock, and glared upon me, as I
courteously received the Pittsburgians. There were
also two red-headed brothers&mdash;boys&mdash;young dragons
rather&mdash;who hovered about Kate, and wouldn't go. A
great crowd they were, for three days; and a very
queer one."</p>


<div class='date'><br />
"<span class="smcap">Still in the same boat.</span> <i>April the Second, 1842.</i><br />
</div>

<p>"Many, many happy returns of the day. It's only
eight o'clock in the morning now, but we mean to drink
your health after dinner, in a bumper; and scores of
Richmond dinners to us! We have some wine (a
present sent on board by our Pittsburgh landlord)
in our own cabin; and we shall tap it to good purpose,
I assure you; wishing you all manner and kinds of happiness,
and a long life to ourselves that we may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
partakers of it. We have wondered a hundred times
already, whether you and Mac will dine anywhere together,
in honor of the day. I say yes, but Kate says
no. She predicts that you'll ask Mac, and he won't
go. I have not yet heard from him.</p>

<p>"We have a better cabin here than we had on board
the Britannia; the berths being much wider, and the
den having two doors: one opening on the ladies' cabin,
and one upon a little gallery in the stern of the boat.
We expect to be at Cincinnati some time on Monday
morning, and we carry about fifty passengers. The
cabin for meals goes right through the boat, from the
prow to the stern, and is very long; only a small portion
of it being divided off, by a partition of wood and
ground glass, for the ladies. We breakfast at half-after
seven, dine at one, and sup at six. Nobody will sit
down to any one of these meals, though the dishes are
smoking on the board, until the ladies have appeared
and taken their chairs. It was the same in the canal-boat.</p>

<p>"The washing department is a little more civilized
than it was on the canal, but bad is the best. Indeed,
the Americans when they are traveling, as Miss Martineau
seems disposed to admit, are exceedingly negligent; not
to say dirty. To the best of my making out, the ladies,
under most circumstances, are content with smearing
their hands and faces in a very small quantity of water.
So are the men; who superadd to that mode of ablution
a hasty use of the common brush and comb. It is quite
a practice, too, to wear but one cotton shirt a week, and
three or four fine linen <i>fronts</i>. Anne reports that this
is Mr. Q.'s course of proceeding; and my portrait-painting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
friend told me that it was the case with pretty nearly
all his sitters; so that when he bought a piece of cloth
not long ago, and instructed the sempstress to make it
<i>all</i> into shirts, not fronts, she thought him deranged.</p>

<p>"My friend the New Englander, of whom I wrote last
night, is perhaps the most intolerable bore on this vast
continent. He drones, and snuffles, and writes poems,
and talks small philosophy and metaphysics, and never
<i>will</i> be quiet, under any circumstances. He is going to
a great temperance convention at Cincinnati; along
with a doctor of whom I saw something at Pittsburgh.
The doctor, in addition to being everything that the
New Englander is, is a phrenologist besides. I dodge
them about the boat. Whenever I appear on deck, I
see them bearing down upon me&mdash;and fly. The New
Englander was very anxious last night that he and I
should 'form a magnetic chain,' and magnetize the
doctor, for the benefit of all incredulous passengers;
but I declined on the plea of tremendous occupation in
the way of letter-writing.</p>

<p>"And, speaking of magnetism, let me tell you that
the other night at Pittsburgh, there being present only
Mr. Q. and the portrait-painter, Kate sat down, laughing,
for me to try my hand upon her. I had been holding
forth upon the subject rather luminously, and asserting
that I thought I could exercise the influence, but had
never tried. In six minutes, I magnetized her into
hysterics, and then into the magnetic sleep. I tried
again next night, and she fell into the slumber in little
more than two minutes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can wake her with perfect
ease; but I confess (not being prepared for anything
so sudden and complete) I was on the first occasion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
rather alarmed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Western parts being sometimes
hazardous, I have fitted out the whole of my little
company with <span class="smcap">Life-Preservers</span>, which I inflate with
great solemnity when we get aboard any boat, and keep,
as Mrs. Cluppins did her umbrella in the court of common
pleas, ready for use upon a moment's notice."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>He resumed his letter, on "Sunday, April the third,"
with allusion to a general who had called upon him in
Washington with two literary ladies, and had written
to him next day for an immediate interview, as "the
two LL's" were ambitious of the honor of a personal
introduction. "Besides the doctor and the dread New
Englander, we have on board that valiant general who
wrote to me about the 'two LL's.' He is an old, old
man with a weazen face, and the remains of a pigeon-breast
in his military surtout. He is acutely gentlemanly
and officer-like. The breast has so subsided, and
the face has become so strongly marked, that he seems,
like a pigeon-pie, to show only the feet of the bird outside,
and to keep the rest to himself. He is perhaps
<i>the</i> most horrible bore in this country. And I am quite
serious when I say that I do not believe there are, on
the whole earth besides, so many intensified bores as in
these United States. No man can form an adequate
idea of the real meaning of the word, without coming
here. There are no particular characters on board,
with these three exceptions. Indeed, I seldom see the
passengers but at meal-times, as I read and write in
our own little state-room.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have smuggled two
chairs into our crib, and write this on a book upon my
knee. Everything is in the neatest order, of course;
and my shaving-tackle, dressing-case, brushes, books,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
and papers, are arranged with as much precision as if
we were going to remain here a month. Thank God
we are not.</p>

<p>"The average width of the river rather exceeds that
of the Thames at Greenwich. In parts it is much
broader; and then there is usually a green island,
covered with trees, dividing it into two streams. Occasionally
we stop for a few minutes at a small town,
or village (I ought to say city, everything is a city
here); but the banks are for the most part deep solitudes,
overgrown with trees, which, in these western
latitudes, are already in leaf, and very green.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"All this I see, as I write, from the little door into
the stern-gallery which I mentioned just now. It don't
happen six times in a day that any other passenger
comes near it; and, as the weather is amply warm
enough to admit of our sitting with it open, here we
remain from morning until night: reading, writing,
talking. What our theme of conversation is, I need
not tell you. No beauty or variety makes us weary less
for home. We count the days, and say, 'When May
comes, and we can say&mdash;<i>next month</i>&mdash;the time will
seem almost gone.' We are never tired of imagining
what you are all about. I allow of no calculation for
the difference of clocks, but insist on a corresponding
minute in London. It is much the shortest way, and
best.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yesterday, we drank your health and many
happy returns&mdash;in wine, after dinner; in a small milk-pot
jug of gin-punch, at night. And when I made a
temporary table, to hold the little candlestick, of one
of my dressing-case trays; cunningly inserted under
the mattress of my berth with a weight atop of it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
keep it in its place, so that it made a perfectly exquisite
bracket; we agreed, that, please God, this should be
a joke at the Star and Garter on the second of April
eighteen hundred and forty-three. If your blank <i>can</i>
be surpassed, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. believe me ours transcends it. My
heart gets, sometimes, <span class="smcap">sore</span> for home.</p>

<p>"At Pittsburgh I saw another solitary confinement
prison: Pittsburgh being also in Pennsylvania. A
horrible thought occurred to me when I was recalling
all I had seen, that night. <i>What if ghosts be one of the
terrors of these jails?</i> I have pondered on it often, since
then. The utter solitude by day and night; the many
hours of darkness; the silence of death; the mind
forever brooding on melancholy themes, and having no
relief; sometimes an evil conscience very busy; imagine
a prisoner covering up his head in the bedclothes
and looking out from time to time, with a ghastly dread
of some inexplicable silent figure that always sits upon
his bed, or stands (if a thing can be said to stand, that
never walks as men do) in the same corner of his cell.
The more I think of it, the more certain I feel that not
a few of these men (during a portion of their imprisonment
at least) are nightly visited by spectres. I did
ask one man in this last jail, if he dreamed much. He
gave me a most extraordinary look, and said&mdash;under
his breath&mdash;in a whisper, 'No.'"</p>


<div class='date'><br />
"<span class="smcap">Cincinnati</span>. <i>Fourth April, 1842.</i><br />
</div>

<p>"We arrived here this morning: about three o'clock,
I believe, but I was fast asleep in my berth. I turned
out soon after six, dressed, and breakfasted on board.
About half-after eight, we came ashore and drove to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
hotel, to which we had written on from Pittsburgh
ordering rooms; and which is within a stone's throw of
the boat-wharf. Before I had issued an official notification
that we were 'not at home,' two Judges called, on
the part of the inhabitants, to know when we would
receive the townspeople. We appointed to-morrow
morning, from half-past eleven to one; arranged to go
out, with these two gentlemen, to see the town, <i>at</i> one;
and were fixed for an evening party to-morrow night at
the house of one of them. On Wednesday morning we
go on by the mail-boat to Louisville, a trip of fourteen
hours; and from that place proceed in the next good
boat to St. Louis, which is a voyage of four days.
Finding from my judicial friends (well-informed and
most agreeable gentlemen) this morning that the prairie
travel to Chicago is a very fatiguing one, and that the
lakes are stormy, sea-sicky, and not over safe at this
season, I wrote by our captain to St. Louis (for the
boat that brought us here goes on there) to the effect,
that I should not take the lake route, but should come
back here; and should visit the prairies, which are
within thirty miles of St. Louis, immediately on my
arrival there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"I have walked to the window, since I turned this
page, to see what aspect the town wears. We are in a
wide street: paved in the carriage-way with small white
stones, and in the footway with small red tiles. The
houses are for the most part one story high; some are
of wood; others of a clean white brick. Nearly all
have green blinds outside every window. The principal
shops over the way are, according to the inscriptions
over them, a Large Bread Bakery; a Book Bindery; a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
Dry Goods Store; and a Carriage Repository; the last-named
establishment looking very like an exceedingly
small retail coal-shed. On the pavement under our
window, a black man is chopping wood; and another
black man is talking (confidentially) to a pig. The
public table, at this hotel and at the hotel opposite,
has just now finished dinner. The diners are collected
on the pavement, on both sides of the way, picking
their teeth, and talking. The day being warm, some
of them have brought chairs into the street. Some are
on three chairs; some on two; and some, in defiance
of all known laws of gravity, are sitting quite comfortably
on one: with three of the chair's legs, and their
own two, high up in the air. The loungers, underneath
our window, are talking of a great Temperance convention
which comes off here to-morrow. Others, about
me. Others, about England. Sir Robert Peel is popular
here, with everybody.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next letter described his experiences in the Far
West, his stay in St. Louis, his visit to a prairie, the
return to Cincinnati, and, after a stage-coach ride from
that city to Columbus, the travel thence to Sandusky,
and so, by Lake Erie, to the Falls of Niagara. All
these subjects appear in the <i>Notes</i>, but nothing printed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
there is repeated in the extracts now to be given. Of
the closing passages of his journey, when he turned
from Columbus in the direction of home, the story,
here for the first time told, is in his most characteristic
vein; the account that will be found of the prairie will
probably be preferred to what is given in the <i>Notes;</i>
the Cincinnati sketches are very pleasant; and even
such a description as that of the Niagara Falls, of which
so much is made in the book, has here an independent
novelty and freshness. The first vividness is in his letter.
The naturalness of associating no image or sense
but of repose, with a grandeur so mighty and resistless,
is best presented suddenly; and, in a few words, we
have the material as well as moral beauty of a scene
unrivaled in its kind upon the earth. The instant impression
we find to be worth more than the eloquent
recollection.</p>

<p>The captain of the boat that had dropped them at
Cincinnati and gone to St. Louis had stayed in the latter
place until they were able to join and return with him;
this letter bears date accordingly, "On board the Messenger
again. Going from St. Louis back to Cincinnati.
Friday, fifteenth April, 1842;" and its first
paragraph is an outline of the movements which it
afterwards describes in detail. "We remained in Cincinnati
one whole day after the date of my last, and left
on Wednesday morning, the 6th. We reached Louisville
soon after midnight on the same night; and slept
there. Next day at one o'clock we put ourselves on
board another steamer, and traveled on until Sunday
evening, the tenth; when we reached St. Louis at about
nine o'clock. The next day we devoted to seeing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
city. Next day, Tuesday, the twelfth, I started off
with a party of men (we were fourteen in all) to see a
prairie; returned to St. Louis about noon on the thirteenth;
attended a soir&eacute;e and ball&mdash;not a dinner&mdash;given
in my honor that night; and yesterday afternoon at
four o'clock we turned our faces homewards. Thank
Heaven!</p>

<p>"Cincinnati is only fifty years old, but is a very
beautiful city; I think the prettiest place I have seen
here, except Boston. It has risen out of the forest like
an Arabian-Night city; is well laid out; ornamented in
the suburbs with pretty villas; and above all, for this is
a very rare feature in America, has smooth turf-plots
and well-kept gardens. There happened to be a great
temperance festival; and the procession mustered under,
and passed, our windows early in the morning. I
suppose they were twenty thousand strong, at least.
Some of the banners were quaint and odd enough. The
ship-carpenters, for instance, displayed on one side of
their flag the good Ship Temperance in full sail; on the
other, the Steamer Alcohol blowing up sky-high. The
Irishmen had a portrait of Father Mathew, you may be
sure. And Washington's broad lower jaw (by-the-by,
Washington had not a pleasant face) figured in all parts
of the ranks. In a kind of square at one outskirt of the
city they divided into bodies, and were addressed by
different speakers. Drier speaking I never heard. I
own that I felt quite uncomfortable to think they could
take the taste of it out of their mouths with nothing
better than water.</p>

<p>"In the evening we went to a party at Judge Walker's,
and were introduced to at least one hundred and fifty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
first-rate bores, separately and singly. I was required
to sit down by the greater part of them, and talk!<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the night we were serenaded (as we usually are in every
place we come to), and very well serenaded, I assure
you. But we were very much knocked up. I really
think my face has acquired a fixed expression of sadness
from the constant and unmitigated boring I endure.
The LL's have carried away all my cheerfulness. There
is a line in my chin (on the right side of the under lip),
indelibly fixed there by the New Englander I told you
of in my last. I have the print of a crow's foot on the
outside of my left eye, which I attribute to the literary
characters of small towns. A dimple has vanished from
my cheek, which I felt myself robbed of at the time by
a wise legislator. But on the other hand I am really
indebted for a good broad grin to P.. E.., literary
critic of Philadelphia, and sole proprietor of the English
language in its grammatical and idiomatical
purity; to P.. E.., with the shiny straight hair and
turned-down shirt-collar, who taketh all of us English
men of letters to task in print, roundly and uncompromisingly,
but told me, at the same time, that I had
'awakened a new era' in his mind.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"The last 200 miles of the voyage from Cincinnati to
St. Louis are upon the Mississippi, for you come down
the Ohio to its mouth. It is well for society that this
Mississippi, the renowned father of waters, had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
children who take after him. It is the beastliest river
in the world."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (His description is in the <i>Notes</i>.)</p>

<p>"Conceive the pleasure of rushing down this stream
by night (as we did last night) at the rate of fifteen
miles an hour; striking against floating blocks of timber
every instant; and dreading some infernal blow at
every bump. The helmsman in these boats is in a little
glass house upon the roof. In the Mississippi, another
man stands in the very head of the vessel, listening and
watching intently; listening, because they can tell in
dark nights by the noise when any great obstruction is
at hand. This man holds the rope of a large bell which
hangs close to the wheel-house, and whenever he pulls
it the engine is to stop directly, and not to stir until he
rings again. Last night, this bell rang at least once in
every five minutes; and at each alarm there was a concussion
which nearly flung one out of bed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. While
I have been writing this account, we have shot out of
that hideous river, thanks be to God; never to see it
again, I hope, but in a nightmare. We are now on the
smooth Ohio, and the change is like the transition from
pain to perfect ease.</p>

<p>"We had a very crowded levee in St. Louis. Of
course the paper had an account of it. If I were to
drop a letter in the street, it would be in the newspaper
next day, and nobody would think its publication an
outrage. The editor objected to my hair, as not curling
sufficiently. He admitted an eye; but objected
again to dress, as being somewhat foppish, 'and indeed
perhaps rather flash.' 'But such,' he benevolently
adds, 'are the differences between American and English
taste&mdash;rendered more apparent, perhaps, by all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
other gentlemen present being dressed in black.' Oh
that you could have seen the other gentlemen!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"A St. Louis lady complimented Kate upon her
voice and manner of speaking, assuring her that she
should never have suspected her of being Scotch, or
even English. She was so obliging as to add that she
would have taken her for an American, anywhere:
which she (Kate) was no doubt aware was a very great
compliment, as the Americans were admitted on all
hands to have greatly refined upon the English language!
I need not tell you that out of Boston and
New York a nasal drawl is universal, but I may as well
hint that the prevailing grammar is also more than
doubtful; that the oddest vulgarisms are received
idioms; that all the women who have been bred in
slave-States speak more or less like negroes, from having
been constantly in their childhood with black nurses;
and that the most fashionable and aristocratic (these are
two words in great use), instead of asking you in what
place you were born, inquire where you 'hail from.' ! !</p>

<p>"Lord Ashburton arrived at Annapolis t'other day,
after a voyage of forty odd days in heavy weather.
Straightway the newspapers state, on the authority of a
correspondent who 'rowed round the ship' (I leave
you to fancy her condition), that America need fear no
superiority from England, in respect of her wooden
walls. The same correspondent is 'quite pleased' with
the frank manner of the English officers; and patronizes
them as being, for John Bulls, quite refined. My
face, like Haji Baba's, turns upside down, and my
liver is changed to water, when I come upon such
things, and think who writes and who read them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>"They won't let me alone about slavery. A certain
judge in St. Louis went so far yesterday that I fell
upon him (to the indescribable horror of the man who
brought him) and told him a piece of my mind. I said
that I was very averse to speaking on the subject here,
and always forbore, if possible; but when he pitied
our national ignorance of the truths of slavery, I must
remind him that we went upon indisputable records,
obtained after many years of careful investigation, and
at all sorts of self-sacrifice, and that I believed we
were much more competent to judge of its atrocity and
horror than he who had been brought up in the midst
of it. I told him that I could sympathize with men
who admitted it to be a dreadful evil, but frankly confessed
their inability to devise a means of getting rid
of it; but that men who spoke of it as a blessing, as a
matter of course, as a state of things to be desired,
were out of the pale of reason; and that for them to
speak of ignorance or prejudice was an absurdity too
ridiculous to be combated.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"It is not six years ago, since a slave in this very
same St. Louis, being arrested (I forget for what), and
knowing he had no chance of a fair trial, be his
offense what it might, drew his bowie-knife and ripped
the constable across the body. A scuffle ensuing, the
desperate negro stabbed two others with the same
weapon. The mob who gathered round (among whom
were men of mark, wealth, and influence in the place)
overpowered him by numbers; carried him away to a
piece of open ground beyond the city; <i>and burned
him alive</i>. This, I say, was done within six years, in
broad day; in a city with its courts, lawyers, tipstaffs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
judges, jails, and hangman; and not a hair on the
head of one of those men has been hurt to this day.
And it is, believe me, it is the miserable, wretched independence
in small things, the paltry republicanism
which recoils from honest service to an honest man,
but does not shrink from every trick, artifice, and
knavery in business, that makes these slaves necessary,
and will render them so, until the indignation of other
countries sets them free.</p>

<p>"They say the slaves are fond of their masters. Look
at this pretty vignette<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> (part of the stock in trade of a
newspaper), and judge how you would feel, when men,
looking in your face, told you such tales with the newspaper
lying on the table. In all the slave-districts,
advertisements for runaways are as much matters of
course as the announcement of the play for the evening
with us. The poor creatures themselves fairly worship
English people: they would do anything for them.
They are perfectly acquainted with all that takes place
in reference to emancipation; and <i>of course</i> their attachment
to us grows out of their deep devotion to
their owners. I cut this illustration out of a newspaper
which had a leader in reference to <i>the abominable and
hellish doctrine of Abolition&mdash;repugnant alike to every
law of God and Nature</i>. 'I know something,' said a
Dr. Bartlett (a very accomplished man), late a fellow-passenger
of ours,&mdash;'I know something of their fondness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
for their masters. I live in Kentucky; and I can
assert upon my honor that, in my neighborhood, it is
as common for a runaway slave, retaken, to draw his
bowie-knife and rip his owner's bowels open, as it is
for you to see a drunken fight in London.'</p>


<div class='date'><br />
"<span class="smcap">Same Boat</span>, <i>Saturday, Sixteenth April, 1842.</i><br />
</div>

<p>"Let me tell you, my dear Forster, before I forget
it, a pretty little scene we had on board the boat between
Louisville and St. Louis, as we were going to
the latter place. It is not much to tell, but it was very
pleasant and interesting to witness."</p>

<p>What follows has been printed in the <i>Notes</i>, and
ought not, by the rule I have laid down, to be given
here. But, beautiful as the printed description is, it
has not profited by the alteration of some touches and
the omission of others in the first fresh version of it,
which, for that reason, I here preserve,&mdash;one of the
most charming soul-felt pictures of character and emotion
that ever warmed the heart in fact or fiction. It
was, I think, Jeffrey's favorite passage in all the writings
of Dickens; and certainly, if any one would learn the
secret of their popularity, it is to be read in the observation
and description of this little incident.</p>

<p>"There was a little woman on board, with a little
baby; and both little woman and little child were
cheerful, good-looking, bright-eyed, and fair to see.
The little woman had been passing a long time with a
sick mother in New York, and had left her home in St.
Louis in that condition in which ladies who truly love
their lords desire to be. The baby had been born in
her mother's house, and she had not seen her husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
(to whom she was now returning) for twelve months:
having left him a month or two after their marriage.
Well, to be sure, there never was a little woman so full
of hope, and tenderness, and love, and anxiety, as this
little woman was: and there she was, all the livelong
day, wondering whether 'he' would be at the wharf;
and whether 'he' had got her letter; and whether, if
she sent the baby on shore by somebody else, <i>'he' would
know it, meeting it in the street:</i> which, seeing that he
had never set eyes upon it in his life, was not very likely
in the abstract, but was probable enough to the young
mother. She was such an artless little creature; and
was in such a sunny, beaming, hopeful state; and let
out all this matter, clinging close about her heart, so
freely; that all the other lady passengers entered into
the spirit of it as much as she: and the captain (who
heard all about it from his wife) was wondrous sly, I
promise you: inquiring, every time we met at table,
whether she expected anybody to meet her at St. Louis,
and supposing she wouldn't want to go ashore the night
we reached it, and cutting many other dry jokes which
convulsed all his hearers, but especially the ladies.
There was one little, weazen, dried-apple old woman
among them, who took occasion to doubt the constancy
of husbands under such circumstances of bereavement;
and there was another lady (with a lap-dog), old enough
to moralize on the lightness of human affections, and
yet not so old that she could help nursing the baby
now and then, or laughing with the rest when the little
woman called it by its father's name, and asked it all
manner of fantastic questions concerning him, in the
joy of her heart. It was something of a blow to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
little woman that when we were within twenty miles
of our destination it became clearly necessary to put
the baby to bed; but she got over that with the same
good humor, tied a little handkerchief over her little
head, and came out into the gallery with the rest.
Then, such an oracle as she became in reference to the
localities! and such facetiousness as was displayed by
the married ladies! and such sympathy as was shown
by the single ones! and such peals of laughter as the
little woman herself (who would just as soon have cried)
greeted every jest with! At last, there were the lights
of St. Louis&mdash;and here was the wharf&mdash;and those were
the steps&mdash;and the little woman, covering her face with
her hands, and laughing, or seeming to laugh, more
than ever, ran into her own cabin, and shut herself up
tight. I have no doubt that, in the charming inconsistency
of such excitement, she stopped her ears lest
she should hear 'him' asking for her; but I didn't see
her do it. Then a great crowd of people rushed on
board, though the boat was not yet made fast, and was
staggering about among the other boats to find a landing-place;
and everybody looked for the husband, and
nobody saw him; when all of a sudden, right in the
midst of them,&mdash;God knows how she ever got there,&mdash;there
was the little woman hugging with both arms
round the neck of a fine, good-looking, sturdy fellow!
And in a moment afterwards, there she was again, dragging
him through the small door of her small cabin, to
look at the baby as he lay asleep!&mdash;What a good thing it
is to know that so many of us would have been quite down-hearted
and sorry if that husband had failed to come!"</p>

<p>He then resumes; but in what follows nothing is repeated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
that will be found in his printed description of
the jaunt to the looking-glass prairie:</p>

<p>"But about the prairie&mdash;it is not, I must confess, so
good in its way as this; but I'll tell you all about that
too, and leave you to judge for yourself. Tuesday the
12th was the day fixed; and we were to start at five in
the morning&mdash;sharp. I turned out at four; shaved and
dressed; got some bread and milk; and, throwing up
the window, looked down into the street. Deuce a
coach was there, nor did anybody seem to be stirring
in the house. I waited until half-past five; but no preparations
being visible even then, I left Mr. Q. to look
out, and lay down upon the bed again. There I slept
until nearly seven, when I was called.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Exclusive
of Mr. Q. and myself, there were twelve of my committee
in the party: all lawyers except one. He was
an intelligent, mild, well-informed gentleman of my
own age,&mdash;the Unitarian minister of the place. With
him, and two other companions, I got into the first
coach.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"We halted at so good an inn at Lebanon that we
resolved to return there at night, if possible. One
would scarcely find a better village alehouse of a homely
kind in England. During our halt I walked into the
village, and met a <i>dwelling-house</i> coming down-hill at
a good round trot, drawn by some twenty oxen! We
resumed our journey as soon as possible, and got upon
the looking-glass prairie at sunset. We halted near a
solitary log house for the sake of its water; unpacked
the baskets; formed an encampment with the carriages;
and dined.</p>

<p>"Now, a prairie is undoubtedly worth seeing&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
more, that one may say one has seen it, than for any
sublimity it possesses in itself. Like most things, great
or small, in this country, you hear of it with considerable
exaggerations. Basil Hall was really quite right
in depreciating the general character of the scenery.
The widely-famed Far West is not to be compared with
even the tamest portions of Scotland or Wales. You
stand upon the prairie, and see the unbroken horizon
all round you. You are on a great plain, which is like
a sea without water. I am exceedingly fond of wild
and lonely scenery, and believe that I have the faculty
of being as much impressed by it as any man living.
But the prairie fell, by far, short of my preconceived
idea. I felt no such emotions as I do in crossing Salisbury
Plain. The excessive flatness of the scene makes
it dreary, but tame. Grandeur is certainly not its characteristic.
I retired from the rest of the party, to
understand my own feelings the better; and looked all
round, again and again. It was fine. It was worth the
ride. The sun was going down, very red and bright;
and the prospect looked like that ruddy sketch of Catlin's,
which attracted our attention (you remember?);
except that there was not so much ground as he represents,
between the spectator and the horizon. But to
say (as the fashion is here) that the sight is a landmark
in one's existence, and awakens a new set of sensations,
is sheer gammon. I would say to every man who can't
see a prairie&mdash;go to Salisbury Plain, Marlborough
Downs, or any of the broad, high, open lands near the
sea. Many of them are fully as impressive, and Salisbury
Plain is <i>decidedly</i> more so.</p>

<p>"We had brought roast fowls, buffalo's tongue, ham,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
bread, cheese, butter, biscuits, sherry, champagne,
lemons and sugar for punch, and abundance of ice. It
was a delicious meal; and, as they were most anxious
that I should be pleased, I warmed myself into a state
of surpassing jollity; proposed toasts from the coach-box
(which was the chair); ate and drank with the best;
and made, I believe, an excellent companion to a very
friendly companionable party. In an hour or so we
packed up, and drove back to the inn at Lebanon.
While supper was preparing, I took a pleasant walk with
my Unitarian friend; and when it was over (we drank
nothing with it but tea and coffee) we went to bed.
The clergyman and I had an exquisitely clean little
chamber of our own; and the rest of the party were
quartered overhead.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"We got back to St. Louis soon after twelve at noon;
and I rested during the remainder of the day. The
soir&eacute;e came off at night, in a very good ball-room at our
inn,&mdash;the Planter's House. The whole of the guests
were introduced to us, singly. We were glad enough,
you may believe, to come away at midnight; and were
very tired. Yesterday, I wore a blouse. To-day, a fur
coat. Trying changes!</p>

<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">In the same Boat</span>,</span><br />
"<i>Sunday, Sixteenth April, 1842.</i><br />
</div>

<p>"The inns in these outlandish corners of the world
would astonish you by their goodness. The Planter's
House is as large as the Middlesex Hospital, and built
very much on our hospital plan, with long wards abundantly
ventilated, and plain whitewashed walls. They
had a famous notion of sending up at breakfast-time
large glasses of new milk with blocks of ice in them as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
clear as crystal. Our table was abundantly supplied
indeed at every meal. One day when Kate and I were
dining alone together, in our own room, we counted
sixteen dishes on the table at the same time.</p>

<p>"The society is pretty rough, and intolerably conceited.
All the inhabitants are young. <i>I didn't see one
gray head in St. Louis.</i> There is an island close by,
called Bloody Island. It is the dueling-ground of St.
Louis; and is so called from the last fatal duel which
was fought there. It was a pistol duel, breast to breast,
and both parties fell dead at the same time. One of
our prairie party (a young man) had acted as second
there, in several encounters. The last occasion was a
duel with rifles, at forty paces; and coming home he
told us how he had bought his man a coat of green linen
to fight in, woolen being usually fatal to rifle-wounds.
Prairie is variously called (on the refinement principle,
I suppose) Para<i>a</i>rer; par<i>e</i>arer; and paro<i>a</i>rer. I am
afraid, my dear fellow, you will have had great difficulty
in reading all the foregoing text. I have written it, very
laboriously, on my knee; and the engine throbs and
starts as if the boat were possessed with a devil.</p>

</div>

<p>"We went ashore at Louisville this night week,
where I left off, two lines above; and slept at the hotel,
in which we had put up before. The Messenger being
abominably slow, we got our luggage out next morning,
and started on again at eleven o'clock in the Benjamin
Franklin mail-boat: a splendid vessel, with a cabin
more than two hundred feet long, and little state-rooms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
affording proportionate conveniences. She got in at
Cincinnati by one o'clock next morning, when we
landed in the dark and went back to our old hotel. As
we made our way on foot over the broken pavement,
Anne measured her length upon the ground, but didn't
hurt herself. I say nothing of Kate's troubles&mdash;but
you recollect her propensity? She falls into, or out of,
every coach or boat we enter; scrapes the skin off her
legs; brings great sores and swellings on her feet; chips
large fragments out of her ankle-bones; and makes
herself blue with bruises. She really has, however,
since we got over the first trial of being among circumstances
so new and so fatiguing, made a <i>most admirable</i>
traveler in every respect. She has never screamed or
expressed alarm under circumstances that would have
fully justified her in doing so, even in my eyes; has
never given way to despondency or fatigue, though we
have now been traveling incessantly, through a very
rough country, for more than a month, and have been
at times, as you may readily suppose, most thoroughly
tired; has always accommodated herself, well and
cheerfully, to everything; and has pleased me very
much, and proved herself perfectly game.</p>

<p>"We remained at Cincinnati all Tuesday the nineteenth,
and all that night. At eight o'clock on Wednesday
morning the twentieth, we left in the mail-stage
for Columbus: Anne, Kate, and Mr. Q. inside; I on
the box. The distance is a hundred and twenty miles;
the road macadamized; and, for an American road,
very good. We were three-and-twenty hours performing
the journey. We traveled all night; reached
Columbus at seven in the morning; breakfasted; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
went to bed until dinner-time. At night we held a
levee for half an hour, and the people poured in as
they always do: each gentleman with a lady on each
arm, exactly like the Chorus to God Save the Queen.
I wish you could see them, that you might know what
a splendid comparison this is. They wear their clothes
precisely as the chorus people do; and stand&mdash;supposing
Kate and me to be in the centre of the stage, with
our backs to the footlights&mdash;just as the company would,
on the first night of the season. They shake hands
exactly after the manner of the guests at a ball at the
Adelphi or the Haymarket; receive any facetiousness
on my part as if there were a stage direction 'all
laugh;' and have rather more difficulty in 'getting off'
than the last gentlemen, in white pantaloons, polished
boots, and berlins, usually display, under the most
trying circumstances.</p>

<p>"Next morning, that is to say, on Friday, the 22d,
at seven o'clock exactly, we resumed our journey. The
stage from Columbus to this place only running thrice
a week, and not on that day, I bargained for an 'exclusive
extra' with four horses; for which I paid forty dollars,
or eight pounds English: the horses changing, as
they would if it were the regular stage. To insure our
getting on properly, the proprietors sent an agent on
the box; and, with no other company but him and a
hamper full of eatables and drinkables, we went upon
our way. It is impossible to convey an adequate idea
to you of the kind of road over which we traveled. I
can only say that it was, at the best, but a track through
the wild forest, and among the swamps, bogs, and morasses
of the withered bush. A great portion of it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
what is called a 'corduroy road:' which is made by
throwing round logs or whole trees into a swamp, and
leaving them to settle there. Good Heaven! if you
only felt one of the least of the jolts with which the
coach falls from log to log! It is like nothing but going
up a steep flight of stairs in an omnibus. Now the
coach flung us in a heap on its floor, and now crushed
our heads against its roof. Now one side of it was deep
in the mire, and we were holding on to the other. Now
it was lying on the horses' tails, and now again upon its
back. But it never, never was in any position, attitude,
or kind of motion, to which we are accustomed
in coaches; or made the smallest approach to our experience
of the proceedings of any sort of vehicle that
goes on wheels. Still, the day was beautiful, the air
delicious, and we were <i>alone;</i> with no tobacco-spittle,
or eternal prosy conversation about dollars and politics
(the only two subjects they ever converse about, or can
converse upon), to bore us. We really enjoyed it;
made a joke of the being knocked about; and were
quite merry. At two o'clock we stopped in the wood
to open our hamper and dine; and we drank to our
darlings and all friends at home. Then we started
again and went on until ten o'clock at night: when we
reached a place called Lower Sandusky, sixty-two miles
from our starting-point. The last three hours of the
journey were not very pleasant; for it lightened&mdash;awfully:
every flash very vivid, very blue, and very long;
and, the wood being so dense that the branches on
<i>either</i> side of the track rattled and broke <i>against</i> the
coach, it was rather a dangerous neighborhood for a
thunder-storm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>"The inn at which we halted was a rough log house.
The people were all abed, and we had to knock them
up. We had the queerest sleeping-room, with two
doors, one opposite the other; both opening directly
on the wild black country, and neither having any lock
or bolt. The effect of these opposite doors was, that
one was always blowing the other open: an ingenuity
in the art of building, which I don't remember to have
met with before. You should have seen me, in my
shirt, blockading them with portmanteaus, and desperately
endeavoring to make the room tidy! But the
blockading was really needful, for in my dressing-case
I have about 250<i>l.</i> in gold; and for the amount of the
middle figure in that scarce metal there are not a
few men in the West who would murder their fathers.
Apropos of this golden store, consider at your leisure the
strange state of things in this country. It has <i>no money;</i>
really no money. The bank-paper won't pass; the
newspapers are full of advertisements from tradesmen
who sell by barter; and American gold is not to be had,
or purchased. I bought sovereigns, English sovereigns,
at first; but as I could get none of them at Cincinnati,
to this day, I have had to purchase French gold; 20-franc
pieces; with which I am traveling as if I were in Paris!</p>

<p>"But let's go back to Lower Sandusky. Mr. Q.
went to bed up in the roof of the log house somewhere,
but was so beset by bugs that he got up after an hour
and <i>lay in the coach</i>, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. where he was obliged to
wait till breakfast-time. We breakfasted, driver and
all, in the one common room. It was papered with
newspapers, and was as rough a place as need be. At
half-past seven we started again, and we reached Sandusky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
at six o'clock yesterday afternoon. It is on Lake
Erie, twenty-four hours' journey by steamboat from
Buffalo. We found no boat here, nor has there been
one, since. We are waiting, with every thing packed
up, ready to start on the shortest notice; and are anxiously
looking out for smoke in the distance.</p>

<p>"There was an old gentleman in the log inn at Lower
Sandusky who treats with the Indians on the part of
the American government, and has just concluded a
treaty with the Wyandot Indians at that place to remove
next year to some land provided for them west of the
Mississippi, a little way beyond St. Louis. He described
his negotiation to me, and their reluctance to
go, exceedingly well. They are a fine people, but
degraded and broken down. If you could see any of
their men and women on a race-course in England, you
would not know them from gipsies.</p>

<p>"We are in a small house here, but a very comfortable
one, and the people are exceedingly obliging. Their
demeanor in these country parts is invariably morose,
sullen, clownish, and repulsive. I should think there
is not, on the face of the earth, a people so entirely
destitute of humor, vivacity, or the capacity of enjoyment.
It is most remarkable. I am quite serious when
I say that I have not heard a hearty laugh these six
weeks, except my own; nor have I seen a merry face
on any shoulders but a black man's. Lounging listlessly
about; idling in bar-rooms; smoking; spitting; and
lolling on the pavement in rocking-chairs, outside the
shop-doors; are the only recreations. I don't think
the national shrewdness extends beyond the Yankees;
that is, the Eastern men. The rest are heavy, dull,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
and ignorant. Our landlord here is from the East.
He is a handsome, obliging, civil fellow. He comes
into the room with his hat on; spits in the fireplace
as he talks; sits down on the sofa with his hat on;
pulls out his newspaper, and reads; but to all this I am
accustomed. He is anxious to please&mdash;and that is
enough.</p>

<p>"We are wishing very much for a boat; for we hope
to find our letters at Buffalo. It is half-past one; and,
as there is no boat in sight, we are fain (sorely against
our wills) to order an early dinner.</p>

pleasure and what unspeakable delight!&mdash;our English
letters!</p>

<p>"We lay all Sunday night at a town (and a beautiful
town too) called Cleveland; on Lake Erie. The people
poured on board, in crowds, by six on Monday morning,
to see me; and a party of 'gentlemen' actually
planted themselves before our little cabin, and stared in
at the door and windows <i>while I was washing, and Kate
lay in bed</i>. I was so incensed at this, and at a certain
newspaper published in that town which I had accidentally
seen in Sandusky (advocating war with England
to the death, saying that Britain must be 'whipped
again,' and promising all true Americans that within
two years they should sing Yankee Doodle in Hyde
Park and Hail Columbia in the courts of Westminster),
that when the mayor came on board to present himself
to me, according to custom, I refused to see him,
and bade Mr. Q. tell him why and wherefore. His
honor took it very coolly, and retired to the top of the
wharf, with a big stick and a whittling knife, with
which he worked so lustily (staring at the closed door
of our cabin all the time) that long before the boat
left, the big stick was no bigger than a cribbage-peg!</p>

<p>"I never in my life was in such a state of excitement
as coming from Buffalo here, this morning. You
come by railroad, and are nigh two hours upon the
way. I looked out for the spray, and listened for the
roar, as far beyond the bounds of possibility as though,
landing in Liverpool, I were to listen for the music of
your pleasant voice in Lincoln's Inn Fields. At last,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
when the train stopped, I saw two great white clouds
rising up from the depths of the earth,&mdash;nothing more.
They rose up slowly, gently, majestically, into the air.
I dragged Kate down a deep and slippery path leading
to the ferry-boat; bullied Anne for not coming fast
enough; perspired at every pore; and felt, it is impossible
to say how, as the sound grew louder and louder
in my ears, and yet nothing could be seen for the
mist.</p>

<p>"There were two English officers with us (ah! what
<i>gentlemen</i>, what noblemen of nature they seemed), and
they hurried off with me; leaving Kate and Anne on
a crag of ice; and clambered after me over the rocks
at the foot of the small Fall, while the ferryman was
getting the boat ready. I was not disappointed&mdash;but I
could make out nothing. In an instant I was blinded
by the spray, and wet to the skin. I saw the water
tearing madly down from some immense height, but
could get no idea of shape, or situation, or anything
but vague immensity. But when we were seated in the
boat, and crossing at the very foot of the cataract&mdash;then
I began to feel what it was. Directly I had
changed my clothes at the inn I went out again, taking
Kate with me, and hurried to the Horse-shoe Fall. I
went down alone, into the very basin. It would be
hard for a man to stand nearer God than he does there.
There was a bright rainbow at my feet; and from that
I looked up to&mdash;great Heaven! to <i>what</i> a fall of bright
green water! The broad, deep, mighty stream seems
to die in the act of falling; and from its unfathomable
grave arises that tremendous ghost of spray and mist
which is never laid, and has been haunting this place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
with the same dread solemnity&mdash;perhaps from the creation
of the world.</p>

<p>"We purpose remaining here a week. In my next I
will try to give you some idea of my impressions, and
to tell you how they change with every day. At present
it is impossible. I can only say that the first effect of
this tremendous spectacle on me was peace of mind&mdash;tranquillity&mdash;great
thoughts of eternal rest and happiness&mdash;nothing
of terror. I can shudder at the recollection
of Glencoe (dear friend, with Heaven's leave
we must see Glencoe together), but whenever I think
of Niagara I shall think of its beauty.</p>

<p>"If you could hear the roar that is in my ears as I
write this. Both Falls are under our windows. From
our sitting-room and bedroom we look down straight
upon them. There is not a soul in the house but ourselves.
What would I give if you and Mac were here
to share the sensations of this time! I was going to
add, what would I give if the dear girl whose ashes lie
in Kensal Green had lived to come so far along with
us&mdash;but she has been here many times, I doubt not,
since her sweet face faded from my earthly sight.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"One word on the precious letters before I close.
You are right, my dear fellow, about the papers; and
you are right (I grieve to say) about the people. <i>Am
I right?</i> quoth the conjurer. <i>Yes!</i> from gallery, pit,
and boxes. I <i>did</i> let out those things, at first, against
my will, but when I come to tell you all&mdash;well; only
wait&mdash;only wait&mdash;till the end of July. I say no more.</p>

<p>"I do perceive a perplexingly divided and subdivided
duty, in the matter of the book of travels. Oh!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
the sublimated essence of comicality that I <i>could</i> distil,
from the materials I have!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You are a part, and
an essential part, of our home, dear friend, and I
exhaust my imagination in picturing the circumstances
under which I shall surprise you by walking into 58,
Lincoln's Inn Fields. We are truly grateful to God
for the health and happiness of our inexpressibly dear
children and all our friends. But one letter more&mdash;only
one.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don't seem to have been half affectionate
enough, but there <i>are</i> thoughts, you know, that
lie too deep for words."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> friend was better than his word, and two more
letters reached me before his return. The opening of
the first was written from Niagara on the 3d, and its
close from Montreal on the 12th, of May; from which
latter city also, on the 26th of that month, the last of
all was written.</p>

<p>Much of the first of these letters had reference to the
international copyright agitation, and gave strong expression
to the indignation awakened in him (nor less
in some of the best men of America) by the adoption, at
a public meeting in Boston itself, of a memorial against
any change of the law, in the course of which it was
stated that, if English authors were invested with any
control over the republication of their own books, it
would be no longer possible for American editors to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
alter and adapt them to the American taste. This deliberate
declaration, however, unsparing as Dickens's
anger at it was, in effect vanquished him. He saw the
hopelessness of pursuing further any present effort to
bring about the change desired; and he took the determination
not only to drop any allusion to it in his
proposed book, but to try what effect might be produced,
when he should again be in England, by a
league of English authors to suspend further intercourse
with American publishers while the law should remain
as it is. On his return he made accordingly a public
appeal to this effect, stating his own intention for the
future to forego all profit derivable from the authorized
transmission of early proofs across the Atlantic; but his
hopes in this particular also were doomed to disappointment.
I now leave the subject, quoting only from his
present letter the general remarks with which it is dismissed
by himself.</p>


<div class='date'><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Niagara Falls</span>,</span><br />
"<i>Tuesday, Third May, 1842.</i><br />
</div>

<p>"I'll tell you what the two obstacles to the passing
of an international copyright law with England are:
firstly, the national love of 'doing' a man in any bargain
or matter of business; secondly, the national
vanity. Both these characteristics prevail to an extent
which no stranger can possibly estimate.</p>

<p>"With regard to the first, I seriously believe that it
is an essential part of the pleasure derived from the perusal
of a popular English book, that the author gets
nothing for it. It is so dar-nation 'cute&mdash;so knowing
in Jonathan to get his reading on those terms. He has
the Englishman so regularly on the hip that his eye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
twinkles with slyness, cunning, and delight; and he
chuckles over the humor of the page with an appreciation
of it quite inconsistent with, and apart from, its
honest purchase. The raven hasn't more joy in eating
a stolen piece of meat, than the American has in reading
the English book which he gets for nothing.</p>

<p>"With regard to the second, it reconciles that better
and more elevated class who are above this sort of satisfaction,
with surprising ease. The man's read in
America! The Americans like him! They are glad
to see him when he comes here! They flock about
him, and tell him that they are grateful to him for
spirits in sickness; for many hours of delight in health;
for a hundred fanciful associations which are constantly
interchanged between themselves and their wives and
children at home! It is nothing that all this takes
place in countries where he is <i>paid;</i> it is nothing that
he has won fame for himself elsewhere, and profit too.
The Americans read him; the free, enlightened, independent
Americans; and what more <i>would</i> he have?
Here's reward enough for any man. The national
vanity swallows up all other countries on the face of
the earth, and leaves but this above the ocean. Now,
mark what the real value of this American reading is.
Find me in the whole range of literature one single
solitary English book which becomes popular with them
before, by going through the ordeal at home and becoming
popular there, it has forced itself on their attention&mdash;and
I am content that the law should remain as
it is, forever and a day. I must make one exception.
There <i>are</i> some mawkish tales of fashionable life before
which crowds fall down as they were gilded calves,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
which have been snugly enshrined in circulating libraries
at home, from the date of their publication.</p>

<p>"As to telling them they will have no literature of
their own, the universal answer (out of Boston) is,
'We don't want one. Why should we pay for one
when we can get it for nothing? Our people don't
think of poetry, sir. Dollars, banks, and cotton are
<i>our</i> books, sir.' And they certainly are in one sense;
for a lower average of general information than exists
in this country on all other topics, it would be very
hard to find. So much, at present, for international
copyright."</p>

<p>The same letter kept the promise made in its predecessor
that one or two more sketches of character
should be sent: "One of the most amusing phrases in
use all through the country, for its constant repetition,
and adaptation to every emergency, is 'Yes, Sir.' Let
me give you a specimen." (The specimen was the dialogue,
in the <i>Notes</i>, of straw-hat and brown-hat, during
the stage-coach ride to Sandusky.) "I am not joking,
upon my word. This is exactly the dialogue. Nothing
else occurring to me at this moment, let me give you
the secretary's portrait. Shall I?</p>

<p>"He is of a sentimental turn&mdash;strongly sentimental;
and tells Anne as June approaches that he hopes 'we
shall sometimes think of him' in our own country.
He wears a cloak, like Hamlet; and a very tall, big,
limp, dusty black hat, which he exchanges on long
journeys for a cap like Harlequin's.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He sings;
and in some of our quarters, when his bedroom has
been near ours, we have heard him grunting bass notes
through the keyhole of his door, to attract our attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
His desire that I should formally ask him to sing,
and his devices to make me do so, are irresistibly absurd.
There was a piano in our room at Hartford (you recollect
our being there, early in February?)&mdash;and he asked
me one night, when we were alone, if 'Mrs. D.' played.
'Yes, Mr. Q.' 'Oh, indeed, Sir! <i>I</i> sing: so whenever
you want <i>a little soothing</i>&mdash;' You may imagine
how hastily I left the room, on some false pretense,
without hearing more.</p>

<p>"He paints.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. An enormous box of oil-colors is
the main part of his luggage: and with these he blazes
away, in his own room, for hours together. Anne got
hold of some big-headed, pot-bellied sketches he made
of the passengers on board the canal-boat (including
me in my fur coat), the recollection of which brings
the tears into my eyes at this minute. He painted the
Falls, at Niagara, superbly; and is supposed now to be
engaged on a full-length representation of me: waiters
having reported that chamber-maids have said that there
is a picture in his room which has a great deal of hair.
One girl opined that it was 'the beginning of the
King's Arms;' but I am pretty sure that the Lion is
myself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Sometimes, but not often, he commences a conversation.
That usually occurs when we are walking the
deck after dark; or when we are alone together in a
coach. It is his practice at such times to relate the
most notorious and patriarchal Joe Miller, as something
that occurred in his own family. When traveling by
coach, he is particularly fond of imitating cows and
pigs; and nearly challenged a fellow-passenger the
other day, who had been moved by the display of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
accomplishment into telling him that he was 'a Perfect
Calf.' He thinks it an indispensable act of politeness
and attention to inquire constantly whether we're not
sleepy, or, to use his own words, whether we don't
'suffer for sleep.' If we have taken a long nap of fourteen
hours or so, after a long journey, he is sure to
meet me at the bedroom door when I turn out in the
morning, with this inquiry. But, apart from the amusement
he gives us, I could not by possibility have lighted
on any one who would have suited my purpose so well.
I have raised his ten dollars per month to twenty; and
mean to make it up for six months."</p>

<p>The conclusion of this letter was dated from "Montreal,
Thursday, twelfth May," and was little more
than an eager yearning for home: "This will be a very
short and stupid letter, my dear friend; for the post
leaves here much earlier than I expected, and all my
grand designs for being unusually brilliant fall to the
ground. I will write you <i>one line</i> by the next Cunard
boat,&mdash;reserving all else until our happy and long long
looked-for meeting.</p>

<p>"We have been to Toronto and Kingston; experiencing
attentions at each which I should have difficulty
in describing. The wild and rabid toryism of Toronto
is, I speak seriously, <i>appalling</i>. English kindness is
very different from American. People send their horses
and carriages for your use, but they don't exact as payment
the right of being always under your nose. We
had no less than <i>five</i> carriages at Kingston waiting our
pleasure at one time; not to mention the commodore's
barge and crew, and a beautiful government steamer.
We dined with Sir Charles Bagot last Sunday. Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
Mulgrave was to have met us yesterday at Lachine;
but, as he was wind-bound in his yacht and couldn't
get in, Sir Richard Jackson sent his drag four-in-hand,
with two other young fellows who are also his aides,
and in we came in grand style.</p>

<p>"The Theatricals (I think I told you<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> I had been
invited to play with the officers of the Coldstream
Guards here) are <i>A Roland for an Oliver;</i> <i>Two o'Clock
in the Morning;</i> and either the <i>Young Widow</i>, or <i>Deaf
as a Post</i>. Ladies (unprofessional) are going to play,
for the first time. I wrote to Mitchell at New York
for a wig for Mr. Snobbington, which has arrived, and
is brilliant. If they had done <i>Love, Law, and Physick</i>,
as at first proposed, I was already 'up' in Flexible,
having played it of old, before my authorship days;
but if it should be Splash in the <i>Young Widow</i>, you
will have to do me the favor to imagine me in a smart
livery-coat, shiny black hat and cockade, white knee-cords,
white top-boots, blue stock, small whip, red
cheeks, and dark eyebrows. Conceive Topping's state
of mind if I bring this dress home and put it on unexpectedly!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
God bless you, dear friend. I can say
nothing about the seventh, the day on which we sail.
It is impossible. Words cannot express what we feel,
now that the time is so near.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>His last letter, dated from "Peasco's Hotel, Montreal,
Canada, twenty-sixth of May," described the
private theatricals, and inclosed me a bill of the play.</p>

<p>"This, like my last, will be a stupid letter, because
both Kate and I are thrown into such a state of excitement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
by the near approach of the seventh of June
that we can do nothing, and think of nothing.</p>

<p>"The play came off last night. The audience, between
five and six hundred strong, were invited as to a
party; a regular table with refreshments being spread
in the lobby and saloon. We had the band of the
twenty-third (one of the finest in the service) in the
orchestra, the theatre was lighted with gas, the scenery
was excellent, and the properties were all brought from
private houses. Sir Charles Bagot, Sir Richard Jackson,
and their staffs were present; and as the military
portion of the audience were all in full uniform, it was
really a splendid scene.</p>

<p>"We 'went' also splendidly; though with nothing
very remarkable in the acting way. We had for Sir
Mark Chase a genuine odd fish, with plenty of humor;
but our Tristram Sappy was not up to the marvelous
reputation he has somehow or other acquired here. I
am not however, let me tell you, placarded as stage-manager
for nothing. Everybody was told they would
have to submit to the most iron despotism; and didn't
I come Macready over them? Oh, no. By no means.
Certainly not. The pains I have taken with them, and
the perspiration I have expended, during the last ten
days, exceed in amount anything you can imagine. I
had regular plots of the scenery made out, and lists of
the properties wanted; and had them nailed up by the
prompter's chair. Every letter that was to be delivered,
was written; every piece of money that had to be
given, provided; and not a single thing lost sight of.
I prompted, myself, when I was not on; when I was, I
made the regular prompter of the theatre my deputy;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
and I never saw anything so perfectly touch and go, as
the first two pieces. The bedroom scene in the interlude
was as well furnished as Vestris had it; with a
'practicable' fireplace blazing away like mad, and everything
in a concatenation accordingly. I really do
believe that I was very funny: at least I know that I
laughed heartily at myself, and made the part a character,
such as you and I know very well: a mixture of
T&mdash;&mdash;, Harley, Yates, Keeley, and Jerry Sneak. It
went with a roar, all through; and, as I am closing
this, they have told me I was so well made up that Sir
Charles Bagot, who sat in the stage-box, had no idea
who played Mr. Snobbington, until the piece was over.</p>

</div>

<p>"But only think of Kate playing! and playing
devilish well, I assure you! All the ladies were capital,
and we had no wait or hitch for an instant. You may
suppose this, when I tell you that we began at eight,
and had the curtain down at eleven. It is their custom
here, to prevent heart-burnings in a very heart-burning
town, whenever they have played in private, to repeat
the performances in public. So, on Saturday (substituting,
of course, real actresses for the ladies), we
repeat the two first pieces to a paying audience, for the
manager's benefit.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"I send you a bill, to which I have appended a
key.</p>

<p>"I have not told you half enough. But I promise
you I shall make you shake your sides about this play.
Wasn't it worthy of Crummles that when Lord Mulgrave
and I went out to the door to receive the Governor-general,
the regular prompter followed us in
agony with four tall candlesticks with wax candles in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
them, and besought us with a bleeding heart to carry
two apiece, in accordance with all the precedents?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"I have hardly spoken of our letters, which reached
us yesterday, shortly before the play began. A hundred
thousand thanks for your delightful mainsail of that
gallant little packet. I read it again and again; and
had it all over again at breakfast-time this morning. I
heard also, by the same ship, from Talfourd, Miss
Coutts, Brougham, Rogers, and others. A delicious
letter from Mac too, as good as his painting, I swear.
Give my hearty love to him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God bless you,
my dear friend. As the time draws nearer, we get
FEVERED with anxiety for home.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Kiss our darlings
for us. We shall soon meet, please God, and be
happier and merrier than ever we were, in all our
lives.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, home&mdash;home&mdash;home&mdash;home&mdash;home&mdash;home&mdash;HOME!!!!!!!!!!!"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A notice</span> written under date of the 23rd December, 1871, appeared with the
Tenth Edition. "Such has been the rapidity of the demand for successive impressions
of this book, that I have found it impossible, until now, to correct at
pages <a href="#Page_31">31</a>, <a href="#Page_87">87</a>, and <a href="#Page_97">97</a> three errors of statement made in the former editions; and
some few other mistakes, not in themselves important, at pages <a href="#Page_96">96</a>, <a href="#Page_101">101</a>, and <a href="#Page_102">102</a>. I
take the opportunity of adding, that the mention at p. <a href="#Page_83">83</a> is not an allusion to
the well-known 'Penny' and 'Saturday' magazines, but to weekly periodicals of
some years' earlier date resembling them in form. One of them, I have since
found from a later mention by Dickens himself, was presumably of a less wholesome
and instructive character. 'I used,' he says, 'when I was at school, to
take in the <i>Terrific Register</i>, making myself unspeakably miserable, and
frightening my very wits out of my head, for the small charge of a penny weekly;
which, considering that there was an illustration to every number in which there
was always a pool of blood, and at least one body, was cheap.' An obliging
correspondent writes to me upon my reference to the Fox-under-the-hill, at p.
<a href="#Page_62">62</a>: 'Will you permit me to say, that the house, shut up and almost ruinous,
is still to be found at the bottom of a curious and most precipitous court, the
entrance of which is just past Salisbury-street.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was once, I think, the
approach to the halfpenny boats. The house is now shut out from the water-side
by the Embankment.'" I proceed to state in detail what the changes thus
referred to were.</p>

<p>The passage about James Lamert, beginning at the thirteenth line of p. <a href="#Page_31">31</a>, now
stands: "His chief ally and encourager in these displays was a youth of some
ability, much older than himself, named James Lamert, stepson to his mother's
sister and therefore a sort of cousin, who was his great patron and friend in his
childish days. Mary, the eldest daughter of Charles Barrow, himself a lieutenant
in the navy, had for her first husband a commander in the navy called Allen;
on whose death by drowning at Rio Janeiro she had joined her sister, the navy-pay
clerk's wife, at Chatham; in which place she subsequently took for her
second husband Doctor Lamert, an army surgeon, whose son James, even after
he had been sent to Sandhurst for his education, continued still to visit Chatham
from time to time. He had a turn for private theatricals; and as his father's
quarters were in the ordnance-hospital there, a great rambling place otherwise
at that time almost uninhabited, he had plenty of room in which to get up his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_vi" id="Page_2_vi">[vi]</a></span>
entertainments." Two other corrections were consequent on this change. At
the 21st line of page <a href="#Page_38">38</a>, for "the elder cousin" read "the cousin by marriage;"
and at the 31st line of p. <a href="#Page_49">49</a>, "cousin by his mother's side" should be "cousin
by his aunt's marriage."</p>

<p>At the 15th line of the <a href="#Page_41">41</a>st page, "his bachelor-uncle, fellow-clerk," &amp;c. should
be "the uncle who was at this time fellow-clerk," &amp;c. At the 11th line of page
<a href="#Page_54">54</a>, "Charles-court" should be "Clare-court." The allusion to one of his favourite
localities at the 23d line of page <a href="#Page_62">62</a> should stand thus: "a little public-house by
the water-side called the Fox-under-the-hill, approached by an underground
passage which we once missed in looking for it together."</p>

<p>The passage at p. <a href="#Page_87">87</a>, having reference to an early friend who had been
with him, as I supposed, at his first school, should run thus: "In this however I
have since discovered my own mistake: the truth being that it was this gentleman's
connection, not with the Wellington-academy, but with a school kept by
Mr. Dawson in Hunter-street, Brunswick-square, where the brothers of Dickens
were subsequently placed, which led to their early knowledge of each other. I
fancy that they were together also, for a short time, at Mr. Molloy's in New-square,
Lincoln's-inn; but, whether or not this was so, Dickens certainly had not
quitted school many months before his father had made sufficient interest with an
attorney of Gray's-inn, Mr. Edward Blackmore, to obtain him regular employment
in his office." There is subsequent allusion to the same gentleman (at p.
<a href="#Page_182">182</a>) as his "school-companion at Mr. Dawson's in Henrietta-street," which
ought to stand as "having known him when himself a law-clerk in Lincoln's-inn."</p>

<p>At p. <a href="#Page_96">96</a> I had stated that Mr. John Dickens reported for the <i>Morning
Chronicle;</i> and at p. <a href="#Page_101">101</a> that Mr. Thomas Beard reported for the <i>Morning
Herald;</i> whereas Mr. Dickens, though in the gallery for other papers, did not
report for the <i>Chronicle</i>, and Mr. Beard did report for that journal; and where
(at p. <a href="#Page_102">102</a>) Dickens was spoken of as associated with Mr. Beard in a reporting
party which represented respectively the <i>Chronicle</i> and <i>Herald</i>, the passage
ought simply to have described him as "connected with a reporting party, being
Lord John Russell's Devonshire contest above-named, and his associate chief
being Mr. Beard, entrusted with command for the <i>Chronicle</i> in this particular
express."</p>

<p>At p. <a href="#Page_97">97</a> I had made a mistake about his "first published piece of writing," in
too hastily assuming that he had himself forgotten what the particular piece was.
It struck an intelligent and kind correspondent as very unlikely that Dickens
should have fallen into error on such a point; and, making personal search for
himself (as I ought to have done), discovered that what I supposed to be another
piece was merely the same under another title. The description of his first
printed sketch should therefore be "(Mr. Minns and his Cousin, as he afterwards
entitled it, but which appeared in the magazine as A Dinner at Poplar Walk)."
There is another mistake at p. <a href="#Page_159">159</a>, of "bandy-legged" instead of "bulky-legged"
and, at p. <a href="#Page_177">177</a>, of "fresh fields" for "fresh woods."</p>

<p>Those several corrections were made in the Tenth Edition. To the Eleventh
these words were prefixed (under date of the 23rd of January, 1872): "Since the
above mentioned edition went to press, a published letter has rendered necessary
a brief additional note to the remarks made at pp. <a href="#Page_155">155</a>-<a href="#Page_156">6</a>." The remark occurs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_vii" id="Page_2_vii">[vii]</a></span>
in my notice of the silly story of Mr. Cruikshank having originated <i>Oliver Twist</i>,
and, with the note referred to, now stands in the form subjoined. "Whether all
Sir Benjamin's laurels however should fall to the person by whom the tale is
told,* or whether any part belongs to the authority alleged for it, is unfortunately
not quite clear. There would hardly have been a doubt, if the fable had been
confined to the other side of the Atlantic; but it has been reproduced and widely
circulated on this side also; and the distinguished artist whom it calumniates
by attributing the invention to him has been left undefended from its slander.
Dickens's letter spares me the necessity of characterizing, by the only word which
would have been applicable to it, a tale of such incredible and monstrous absurdity
as that one of the masterpieces of its author's genius had been merely an
illustration of etchings by Mr. Cruikshank!" Note to the words "person by
whom the tale is told:" "*This question has been partly solved, since my last
edition, by Mr. Cruikshank's announcement in the <i>Times</i>, that, though Dr.
Mackenzie had 'confused some circumstances with respect to Mr. Dickens looking
over some drawings and sketches,' the substance of his information as to
who it was that originated <i>Oliver Twist</i>, and all its characters, had been derived
from Mr. Cruikshank himself. The worst part of the foregoing fable, therefore,
has not Dr. Mackenzie for its author; and Mr. Cruikshank is to be congratulated
on the prudence of his rigid silence respecting it as long as Mr. Dickens lived."</p>

<p>In the Twelfth Edition I mentioned, in the note at p. <a href="#Page_149">149</a>, a little work of which
all notice had been previously omitted; and the close of that note now runs: "He
had before written for them, without his name, <i>Sunday under Three Heads;</i> and
he added subsequently a volume of <i>Young Couples</i>." At p. <a href="#Page_157">157</a>, "parish abuses"
is corrected in the same edition to "parish practices;" and at p. <a href="#Page_173">173</a>, "in his
later works" to "in his latest works."</p>

<p>I have received letters from several obliging correspondents, among them three
or four who were scholars at the Wellington-house Academy before or after
Dickens's time, and one who attended the school with him; but such remark as
they suggest will more properly accompany my third and closing volume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reality did not fall short of the anticipation of
home. His return was the occasion of unbounded enjoyment;
and what he had planned before sailing as
the way we should meet, received literal fulfilment. By
the sound of his cheery voice I first knew that he was
come; and from my house we went together to Maclise,
also "without a moment's warning." A Greenwich dinner
in which several friends (Talfourd, Milnes, Procter,
Maclise, Stanfield, Marryat, Barham, Hood, and Cruikshank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_22" id="Page_2_22">[22]</a></span>
among them) took part, and other immediate
greetings, followed; but the most special celebration
was reserved for autumn, when, by way of challenge to
what he had seen while abroad, a home-journey was
arranged with Stanfield, Maclise, and myself for his
companions, into such of the most striking scenes of a
picturesque English county as the majority of us might
not before have visited: Cornwall being ultimately
chosen.</p>

<p>Before our departure he was occupied by his preparation
of the <i>American Notes;</i> and to the same interval
belongs the arrival in London of Mr. Longfellow, who
became his guest, and (for both of us I am privileged
to add) our attached friend. Longfellow's name was
not then the pleasant and familiar word it has since
been in England; but he had already written several
of his most felicitous pieces, and he possessed all the
qualities of delightful companionship, the culture and
the charm, which have no higher type or example than
the accomplished and genial American. He reminded
me, when lately again in England, of two experiences out
of many we had enjoyed together this quarter of a century
before. One of them was a day at Rochester, when,
met by one of those prohibitions which are the wonder
of visitors and the shame of Englishmen, we overleapt
gates and barriers, and, setting at defiance repeated
threats of all the terrors of law coarsely expressed to us
by the custodian of the place, explored minutely the
castle ruins. The other was a night among those portions
of the population which outrage law and defy its
terrors all the days of their lives, the tramps and thieves
of London; when, under guidance and protection of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_23" id="Page_2_23">[23]</a></span>
the most trusted officers of the two great metropolitan
prisons afforded to us by Mr. Chesterton and Lieut.
Tracey, we went over the worst haunts of the most
dangerous classes. Nor will it be unworthy of remark,
in proof that attention is not drawn vainly to such
scenes, that, upon Dickens going over them a dozen
years later when he wrote a paper about them for his
<i>Household Words</i>, he found important changes effected
whereby these human dens, if not less dangerous, were
become certainly more decent. On the night of our
earlier visit, Maclise, who accompanied us, was struck
with such sickness on entering the first of the Mint
lodging-houses in the borough, that he had to remain,
for the time we were in them, under guardianship of the
police outside. Longfellow returned home by the Great
Western from Bristol on the 21st of October, enjoying
as he passed through Bath the hospitality of Landor;
and at the end of the following week we started on our
Cornish travel.</p>

<p>But what before this had occupied Dickens in the
writing way must now be told. Not long after his reappearance
amongst us, his house being still in the
occupation of Sir John Wilson, he went to Broadstairs,
taking with him the letters from which I have
quoted so largely to help him in preparing his <i>American
Notes;</i> and one of his first announcements to me (18th
of July) shows not only this labour in progress, but
the story he was under engagement to begin in November
working in his mind. "The subjects at the
beginning of the book are of that kind that I can't
<i>dash</i> at them, and now and then they fret me in consequence.
When I come to Washington, I am all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_24" id="Page_2_24">[24]</a></span>
right. The solitary prison at Philadelphia is a good
subject, though; I forgot that for the moment. Have
you seen the Boston chapter yet?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have never
been in Cornwall either. A mine certainly; and a
letter for that purpose shall be got from Southwood
Smith. I have some notion of opening the new book
in the lantern of a lighthouse!" A letter a couple of
months later (16th of Sept.) recurs to that proposed
opening of his story which after all he laid aside; and
shows how rapidly he was getting his <i>American Notes</i>
into shape. "At the Isle of Thanet races yesterday
I saw&mdash;oh! who shall say what an immense amount
of character in the way of inconceivable villainy and
blackguardism! I even got some new wrinkles in the
way of showmen, conjurors, pea-and-thimblers, and
trampers generally. I think of opening my new book
on the coast of Cornwall, in some terribly dreary iron-bound
spot. I hope to have finished the American
book before the end of next month; and we will then
together fly down into that desolate region." Our
friends having Academy engagements to detain them,
we had to delay a little; and I meanwhile turn back
to his letters to observe his progress with his <i>Notes</i>,
and other employments or enjoyments of the interval.
They require no illustration that they will not themselves
supply: but I may remark that the then collected
<i>Poems</i> of Tennyson had become very favourite reading
with him; and that while in America Mr. Mitchell
the comedian had given him a small white shaggy
terrier, who bore at first the imposing name of Timber
Doodle, and became a great domestic pet and companion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_25" id="Page_2_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been reading" (7th of August) "Tennyson
all this morning on the seashore. Among other trifling
effects, the waters have dried up as they did of old,
and shown me all the mermen and mermaids, at the
bottom of the ocean; together with millions of queer
creatures, half-fish and half-fungus, looking down into
all manner of coral caves and seaweed conservatories;
and staring in with their great dull eyes at every open
nook and loop-hole. Who else, too, could conjure up
such a close to the extraordinary and as Landor would
say 'most wonderful' series of pictures in the 'dream
of fair women,' as&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am getting on pretty well, but it was so glittering
and sunshiny yesterday that I was forced to make holiday."
Four days later: "I have not written a word

think it goes as it should .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Little doggy improves
rapidly, and now jumps over my stick at the word of
command. I have changed his name to Snittle Timbery,
as more sonorous and expressive. He unites with
the rest of the family in cordial regards and loves.

and the Four Patagonians (see Goldsmith's <i>Essays</i>)
are performing thrice a week at Ranelagh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>A visit from me was at this time due, to which these
were held out as inducements; and there followed what
it was supposed I could not resist, a transformation into
the broadest farce of a deep tragedy by a dear friend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_26" id="Page_2_26">[26]</a></span>
of ours. "Now you really must come. Seeing only
is believing, very often isn't that, and even Being the
thing falls a long way short of believing it. Mrs.
Nickleby herself once asked me, as you know, if I
really believed there ever was such a woman; but
there'll be no more belief, either in me or my descriptions,
after what I have to tell of our excellent friend's
tragedy, if you don't come and have it played again
for yourself 'by particular desire.' We saw it last night,
and oh! if you had but been with us! Young Betty,
doing what the mind of man without my help never
<i>can</i> conceive, with his legs like padded boot-trees
wrapped up in faded yellow drawers, was the hero.
The comic man of the company enveloped in a white
sheet, with his head tied with red tape like a brief and
greeted with yells of laughter whenever he appeared,
was the venerable priest. A poor toothless old idiot at
whom the very gallery roared with contempt when he
was called a tyrant, was the remorseless and aged
Creon. And Ismene being arrayed in spangled muslin
trowsers very loose in the legs and very tight in the
ankles, such as Fatima would wear in <i>Blue Beard</i>, was
at her appearance immediately called upon for a song.
After this, can you longer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?"</p>

<p>With the opening of September I had renewed report
of his book, and of other matters. "The Philadelphia
chapter I think very good, but I am sorry to
say it has not made as much in print as I hoped .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
In America they have forged a letter with my signature,
which they coolly declare appeared in the <i>Chronicle</i>
with the copyright circular; and in which I express
myself in such terms as you may imagine, in reference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_27" id="Page_2_27">[27]</a></span>
to the dinners and so forth. It has been widely distributed
all over the States; and the felon who invented
it is a 'smart man' of course. You are to understand
that it is not done as a joke, and is scurrilously
reviewed. Mr. Park Benjamin begins a lucubration
upon it with these capitals, <span class="smcap">Dickens is a Fool,
and a Liar</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have a new prot&eacute;g&eacute;, in the person
of a wretched deaf and dumb boy whom I found
upon the sands the other day, half dead, and have got
(for the present) into the union infirmary at Minster.
A most deplorable case."</p>

<p>On the 14th he told me: "I have pleased myself
very much to-day in the matter of Niagara. I have
made the description very brief (as it should be), but I
fancy it is good. I am beginning to think over the introductory
chapter, and it has meanwhile occurred to
me that I should like, at the beginning of the volumes,
to put what follows on a blank page. <i>I dedicate this
Book to those friends of mine in America, who, loving
their country, can bear the truth, when it is written good
humouredly and in a kind spirit.</i> What do you think?
Do you see any objection?"</p>

<p>My reply is to be inferred from what he sent back on
the 20th. "I don't quite see my way towards an expression
in the dedication of any feeling in reference
to the American reception. Of course I have always
intended to glance at it, gratefully, in the end of the
book; and it will have its place in the introductory
chapter, if we decide for that. Would it do to put in,
after 'friends in America,' <i>who giving me a welcome I
must ever gratefully and proudly remember, left my judgment
free, and</i> who, loving, &amp;c. If so, so be it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_28" id="Page_2_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the end of the month he wrote: "For the last
two or three days I have been rather slack in point of
work; not being in the vein. To-day I had not written
twenty lines before I rushed out (the weather being
gorgeous) to bathe. And when I have done that, it is
all up with me in the way of authorship until to-morrow.
The little dog is in the highest spirits; and jumps,
as Mr. Kenwigs would say, perpetivally. I have had
letters by the Britannia from Felton, Prescott, Mr. Q,
and others, all very earnest and kind. I think you will
like what I have written on the poor emigrants and
their ways as I literally and truly saw them on the boat
from Quebec to Montreal."</p>

<p>This was a passage, which, besides being in itself as
attractive as any in his writings, gives such perfect expression
to a feeling that underlies them all, that I subjoin
it in a note.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> On board this Canadian steamboat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_29" id="Page_2_29">[29]</a></span>
he encountered crowds of poor emigrants and their
children; and such was their patient kindness and
cheerful endurance, in circumstances where the easy-living
rich could hardly fail to be monsters of impatience
and selfishness, that it suggested to him a reflection than
which it was not possible to have written anything more
worthy of observation, or more absolutely true. Jeremy
Taylor has the same philosophy in his lesson on opportunities,
but here it was beautified by the example with
all its fine touches. It made us read Rich and Poor by
new translation.</p>

<p>The printers were now hard at work, and in the last
week of September he wrote: "I send you proofs as
far as Niagara .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am rather holiday-making this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_30" id="Page_2_30">[30]</a></span>
week .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. taking principal part in a regatta here yesterday,
very pretty and gay indeed. We think of
coming up in time for Macready's opening, when perhaps
you will give us a chop; and of course you and
Mac will dine with <i>us</i> the next day? I shall leave
nothing of the book to do after coming home, please
God, but the two chapters on slavery and the people
which I could manage easily in a week, if need were .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
policeman who supposed the Duke of Brunswick
to be one of the swell mob, ought instantly to be
made an inspector. The suspicion reflects the highest
credit (I seriously think) on his penetration and judgment."
Three days later: "For the last two days we
have had gales blowing from the north-east, and seas
rolling on us that drown the pier. To-day it is tremendous.
Such a sea was never known here at this
season, and it is running in at this moment in waves of
twelve feet high. You would hardly know the place.
But we shall be punctual to your dinner hour on Saturday.
If the wind should hold in the same quarter, we
may be obliged to come up by land; and in that case
I should start the caravan at six in the morning.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
What do you think of this for my title&mdash;<i>American Notes
for General Circulation;</i> and of this motto?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In reply to a question from the Bench, the Solicitor for the Bank
observed, that this kind of notes circulated the most extensively, in
those parts of the world where they were stolen and forged. <i>Old
Bailey Report.</i>"</p></div>

<p>The motto was omitted, objection being made to it;
and on the last day of the month I had the last of his
letters during this Broadstairs visit. "Strange as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_31" id="Page_2_31">[31]</a></span>
may appear to you" (25th of September), "the sea is
running so high that we have no choice but to return
by land. No steamer can come out of Ramsgate, and
the Margate boat lay out all night on Wednesday with
all her passengers on board. You may be sure of us
therefore on Saturday at 5, for I have determined to
leave here to-morrow, as we could not otherwise manage
it in time; and have engaged an omnibus to bring
the whole caravan by the overland route.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We cannot
open a window, or a door; legs are of no use on
the terrace; and the Margate boats can only take people
aboard at Herne Bay!" He brought with him all
that remained to be done of his second volume except
the last two chapters, including that to which he has
referred as "introductory;" and on the following
Wednesday (5th of October) he told me that the first
of these was done. "I want you very much to come
and dine to-day that we may repair to Drury-lane together;
and let us say half-past four, or there is no
time to be comfortable. I am going out to Tottenham
this morning, on a cheerless mission I would willingly
have avoided. Hone, of the <i>Every Day Book</i>, is
dying; and sent Cruikshank yesterday to beg me to go
and see him, as, having read no books but mine of late,
he wanted to see and shake hands with me before (as
George said) 'he went.' There is no help for it, of
course; so to Tottenham I repair, this morning. I
worked all day, and till midnight; and finished the
slavery chapter yesterday."</p>

<p>The cheerless visit had its mournful sequel before the
next month closed, when he went with the same companion
to poor Hone's funeral; and one of his letters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_32" id="Page_2_32">[32]</a></span>
written at the time to Mr. Felton has so vividly recalled
to me the tragi-comedy of an incident of that day, as
for long after he used to describe it, and as I have heard
the other principal actor in it good-naturedly admit to
be perfectly true, that two or three sentences may be
given here. The wonderful neighbourhood in this life
of ours, of serious and humorous things, constitutes in
itself very much of the genius of Dickens's writing;
the laughter close to the pathos, but never touching it
with ridicule; and this small occurrence may be taken
in farther evidence of its reality.</p>

<p>"We went into a little parlour where the funeral
party was, and God knows it was miserable enough, for
the widow and children were crying bitterly in one
corner, and the other mourners (mere people of ceremony,
who cared no more for the dead man than the
hearse did) were talking quite coolly and carelessly together
in another; and the contrast was as painful and
distressing as anything I ever saw. There was an independent
clergyman present, with his bands on and a
bible under his arm, who, as soon as we were seated,
addressed C thus, in a loud emphatic voice. 'Mr. C,
have you seen a paragraph respecting our departed
friend, which has gone the round of the morning papers?'
'Yes, sir,' says C, 'I have:' looking very hard
at me the while, for he had told me with some pride
coming down that it was his composition. 'Oh!' said
the clergyman. 'Then you will agree with me, Mr. C,
that it is not only an insult to me, who am the servant
of the Almighty, but an insult to the Almighty, whose
servant I am.' 'How is that, sir?' says C. 'It is
stated, Mr. C, in that paragraph,' says the minister,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_33" id="Page_2_33">[33]</a></span>
'that when Mr. Hone failed in business as a bookseller,
he was persuaded by <i>me</i> to try the pulpit; which is false,
incorrect, unchristian, in a manner blasphemous, and
in all respects contemptible. Let us pray.' With
which, and in the same breath, I give you my word, he
knelt down, as we all did, and began a very miserable
jumble of an extemporary prayer. I was really penetrated
with sorrow for the family" (he exerted himself
zealously for them afterwards, as the kind-hearted C
also did), "but when C, upon his knees and sobbing
for the loss of an old friend, whispered me 'that if that
wasn't a clergyman, and it wasn't a funeral, he'd have
punched his head,' I felt as if nothing but convulsions
could possibly relieve me."</p>

<p>On the 10th of October I heard from him that the
chapter intended to be introductory to the <i>Notes</i> was
written, and waiting our conference whether or not it
should be printed. We decided against it; on his
part so reluctantly, that I had to undertake for its publication
when a more fitting time should come. This
in my judgment has arrived, and the chapter first sees
the light on this page. There is no danger at present,
as there would have been when it was written, that its
proper self-assertion should be mistaken for an apprehension
of hostile judgments which he was anxious to
deprecate or avoid. He is out of reach of all that
now; and reveals to us here, as one whom fear or censure
can touch no more, his honest purpose in the use
of satire even where his humorous temptations were
strongest. What he says will on other grounds also
be read with unusual interest, for it will be found to
connect itself impressively not with his first experiences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_34" id="Page_2_34">[34]</a></span>
only, but with his second visit to America at
the close of his life. He held always the same high
opinion of what was best in that country, and always
the same contempt for what was worst in it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='center'>"INTRODUCTORY. AND NECESSARY TO BE READ.</div>

<p>"I have placed the foregoing title at the head of
this page, because I challenge and deny the right of
any person to pass judgment on this book, or to arrive
at any reasonable conclusion in reference to it, without
first being at the trouble of becoming acquainted
with its design and purpose.</p>

<p>"It is not statistical. Figures of arithmetic have
already been heaped upon America's devoted head, almost
as lavishly as figures of speech have been piled
above Shakespeare's grave.</p>

<p>"It comprehends no small talk concerning individuals,
and no violation of the social confidences of private
life. The very prevalent practice of kidnapping
live ladies and gentlemen, forcing them into cabinets,
and labelling and ticketing them whether they will or
no, for the gratification of the idle and the curious, is
not to my taste. Therefore I have avoided it.</p>

<p>"It has not a grain of any political ingredient in its
whole composition.</p>

<p>"Neither does it contain, nor have I intended that
it should contain, any lengthened and minute account
of my personal reception in the United States: not
because I am, or ever was, insensible to that spontaneous
effusion of affection and generosity of heart, in a
most affectionate and generous-hearted people; but
because I conceive that it would ill become me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_35" id="Page_2_35">[35]</a></span>
flourish matter necessarily involving so much of my
own praises, in the eyes of my unhappy readers.</p>

<p>"This book is simply what it claims to be&mdash;a record
of the impressions I received from day to day, during
my hasty travels in America, and sometimes (but not
always) of the conclusions to which they, and after-reflection
on them, have led me; a description of the
country I passed through; of the institutions I visited;
of the kind of people among whom I journeyed; and
of the manners and customs that came within my observation.
Very many works having just the same
scope and range, have been already published, but I
think that these two volumes stand in need of no
apology on that account. The interest of such productions,
if they have any, lies in the varying impressions
made by the same novel things on different
minds; and not in new discoveries or extraordinary
adventures.</p>

<p>"I can scarcely be supposed to be ignorant of the
hazard I run in writing of America at all. I know
perfectly well that there is, in that country, a numerous
class of well-intentioned persons prone to be dissatisfied
with all accounts of the Republic whose citizens they
are, which are not couched in terms of exalted and
extravagant praise. I know perfectly well that there is
in America, as in most other places laid down in maps
of the great world, a numerous class of persons so
tenderly and delicately constituted, that they cannot
bear the truth in any form. And I do not need the
gift of prophecy to discern afar off, that they who will
be aptest to detect malice, ill will, and all uncharitableness
in these pages, and to show, beyond any doubt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_36" id="Page_2_36">[36]</a></span>
that they are perfectly inconsistent with that grateful
and enduring recollection which I profess to entertain
of the welcome I found awaiting me beyond the Atlantic&mdash;will
be certain native journalists, veracious and
gentlemanly, who were at great pains to prove to me,
on all occasions during my stay there, that the aforesaid
welcome was utterly worthless.</p>

<p>"But, venturing to dissent even from these high
authorities, I formed my own opinion of its value in
the outset, and retain it to this hour; and in asserting
(as I invariably did on all public occasions) my liberty
and freedom of speech while I was among the Americans,
and in maintaining it at home, I believe that I
best show my sense of the high worth of that welcome,
and of the honourable singleness of purpose with which
it was extended to me. From first to last I saw, in the
friends who crowded round me in America, old readers,
over-grateful and over-partial perhaps, to whom I had
happily been the means of furnishing pleasure and
entertainment; not a vulgar herd who would flatter
and cajole a stranger into turning with closed eyes from
all the blemishes of the nation, and into chaunting its
praises with the discrimination of a street ballad-singer.
From first to last I saw, in those hospitable hands, a
home-made wreath of laurel; and not an iron muzzle
disguised beneath a flower or two.</p>

<p>"Therefore I take&mdash;and hold myself not only justified
in taking, but bound to take&mdash;the plain course of
saying what I think, and noting what I saw; and as it
is not my custom to exalt what in my judgment are
foibles and abuses at home, so I have no intention of
softening down, or glozing over, those that I have
observed abroad.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_37" id="Page_2_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"If this book should fall into the hands of any
sensitive American who cannot bear to be told that the
working of the institutions of his country is far from
perfect; that in spite of the advantage she has over all
other nations in the elastic freshness and vigour of her
youth, she is far from being a model for the earth to
copy; and that even in those pictures of the national
manners with which he quarrels most, there is still
(after the lapse of several years, each of which may be
fairly supposed to have had its stride in improvement)
much that is just and true at this hour; let him lay it
down, now, for I shall not please him. Of the intelligent,
reflecting, and educated among his countrymen,
I have no fear; for I have ample reason to believe,
after many delightful conversations not easily to be
forgotten, that there are very few topics (if any) on
which their sentiments differ materially from mine.</p>

<p>"I may be asked&mdash;'If you have been in any respect
disappointed in America, and are assured beforehand
that the expression of your disappointment will give
offence to any class, why do you write at all?' My
answer is, that I went there expecting greater things
than I found, and resolved as far as in me lay to do
justice to the country, at the expense of any (in my
view) mistaken or prejudiced statements that might
have been made to its disparagement. Coming home
with a corrected and sobered judgment, I consider myself
no less bound to do justice to what, according to
my best means of judgment, I found to be the truth."</p></div>

<p>Of the book for whose opening page this matter
introductory was written, it will be enough merely to
add that it appeared on the 18th of October; that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_38" id="Page_2_38">[38]</a></span>
before the close of the year four large editions had been
sold; and that in my opinion it thoroughly deserved
the estimate formed of it by one connected with
America by the strongest social affections, and otherwise
in all respects an honourable, high-minded, upright
judge. "You have been very tender," wrote Lord
Jeffrey, "to our sensitive friends beyond sea, and my
whole heart goes along with every word you have written.
I think that you have perfectly accomplished all
that you profess or undertake to do, and that the world
has never yet seen a more faithful, graphic, amusing,
kind-hearted narrative."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I permit myself so far to anticipate a later page as to
print here a brief extract from one of the letters of the
last American visit. Without impairing the interest
with which the narrative of that time will be read in its
proper place, I shall thus indicate the extent to which
present impressions were modified by the experience of
twenty-six years later. He is writing from Philadelphia
on the fourteenth of January, 1868.</p>

<p>"I see <i>great changes</i> for the better, socially. Politically,
no. England governed by the Marylebone vestry
and the penny papers, and England as she would be
after years of such governing; is what I make of <i>that</i>.
Socially, the change in manners is remarkable. There
is much greater politeness and forbearance in all ways.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
On the other hand there are still provincial oddities
wonderfully quizzical; and the newspapers are
constantly expressing the popular amazement at 'Mr.
Dickens's extraordinary composure.' They seem to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_39" id="Page_2_39">[39]</a></span>
take it ill that I don't stagger on to the platform overpowered
by the spectacle before me, and the national
greatness. They are all so accustomed to do public
things with a flourish of trumpets, that the notion of
my coming in to read without somebody first flying up
and delivering an 'Oration' about me, and flying down
again and leading me in, is so very unaccountable to
them, that sometimes they have no idea until I open
my lips that it can possibly be Charles Dickens."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Cornish trip had come off, meanwhile, with such
unexpected and continued attraction for us that we were
well into the third week of absence before we turned
our faces homeward. Railways helped us then not
much; but where the roads were inaccessible to post-horses,
we walked. Tintagel was visited, and no part
of mountain or sea consecrated by the legends of
Arthur was left unexplored. We ascended to the
cradle of the highest tower of Mount St. Michael, and
descended into several mines. Land and sea yielded
each its marvels to us; but of all the impressions
brought away, of which some afterwards took forms as
lasting as they could receive from the most delightful
art, I doubt if any were the source of such deep emotion
to us all as a sunset we saw at Land's-end. Stanfield<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_41" id="Page_2_41">[41]</a></span>
knew the wonders of the Continent, the glories
of Ireland were native to Maclise, I was familiar from
boyhood with border and Scottish scenery, and Dickens
was fresh from Niagara; but there was something in the
sinking of the sun behind the Atlantic that autumn
afternoon, as we viewed it together from the top of the
rock projecting farthest into the sea, which each in his
turn declared to have no parallel in memory.</p>

<p>But with the varied and overflowing gladness of
those three memorable weeks it would be unworthy
now to associate only the saddened recollection of the
sole survivor. "Blessed star of morning!" wrote
Dickens to Felton while yet the glow of its enjoyment
was upon him. "Such a trip as we had into Cornwall
just after Longfellow went away!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sometimes we
travelled all night, sometimes all day, sometimes both.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Heavens! If you could have seen the necks of
bottles, distracting in their immense varieties of shape,
peering out of the carriage pockets! If you could
have witnessed the deep devotion of the post-boys,
the wild attachment of the hostlers, the maniac glee
of the waiters! If you could have followed us into
the earthy old churches we visited, and into the strange
caverns on the gloomy sea-shore, and down into the
depths of mines, and up to the tops of giddy heights
where the unspeakable green water was roaring, I don't
know how many hundred feet below! If you could
have seen but one gleam of the bright fires by which
we sat in the big rooms of ancient inns at night, until
long after the small hours had come and gone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
never laughed in my life as I did on this journey. It
would have done you good to hear me. I was choking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_42" id="Page_2_42">[42]</a></span>
and gasping and bursting the buckle off the back of
my stock, all the way. And Stanfield got into such
apoplectic entanglements that we were often obliged
to beat him on the back with portmanteaus before we
could recover him. Seriously, I do believe there never
was such a trip. And they made such sketches, those
two men, in the most romantic of our halting-places,
that you would have sworn we had the Spirit of Beauty
with us, as well as the Spirit of Fun."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The Logan Stone, by Stanfield, was one of them; and
it laughingly sketched both the charm of what was seen
and the mirth of what was done, for it perched me on
the top of the stone. It is historical, however, the
ascent having been made; and of this and other examples
of steadiness at heights which deterred the rest, as
well as of a subject suggested for a painting of which
Dickens became the unknown purchaser, Maclise reminded
me in some pleasant allusions many years later,
which, notwithstanding their tribute to my athletic
achievements, the good-natured reader must forgive my
printing. They complete the little picture of our trip.
Something I had written to him of recent travel among
the mountain scenery of the wilder coasts of Donegal
had touched the chord of these old remembrances.
"As to your clambering," he replied, "don't I know
what happened of old? Don't I still see the Logan
Stone, and you perched on the giddy top, while we,
rocking it on its pivot, shrank from all that lay concealed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_43" id="Page_2_43">[43]</a></span>
below! Should I ever have blundered on the
waterfall of St. Wighton, if you had not piloted the
way? And when we got to Land's-end, with the green
sea far under us lapping into solitary rocky nooks where
the mermaids live, who but you only had the courage
to stretch over, to see those diamond jets of brightness
that I swore then, and believe still, were the flappings
of their tails! And don't I recall you again, sitting on
the tip-top stone of the cradle-turret over the highest
battlement of the castle of St. Michael's Mount, with
not a ledge or coigne of vantage 'twixt you and the
fathomless ocean under you, distant three thousand
feet? Last, do I forget you clambering up the goat-path
to King Arthur's castle of Tintagel, when, in my
vain wish to follow, I grovelled and clung to the soil
like a Caliban, and you, in the manner of a tricksy
spirit and stout Ariel, actually danced up and down
before me!"</p>

<p>The waterfall I led him to was among the records of
the famous holiday, celebrated also by Thackeray in one
of his pen-and-ink pleasantries, which were sent by both
painters to the next year's Academy; and so eager was
Dickens to possess this landscape by Maclise which
included the likeness of a member of his family, yet so
anxious that our friend should be spared the sacrifice
which he knew would follow an avowal of his wish, that
he bought it under a feigned name before the Academy
opened, and steadily refused to take back the money
which on discovery of the artifice Maclise pressed upon
him.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Our friend, who already had munificently given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_44" id="Page_2_44">[44]</a></span>
him a charming drawing of his four eldest children to
accompany him and his wife to America, had his generous
way nevertheless; and as a voluntary offering four
years later, painted Mrs. Dickens on a canvas of the
same size as the picture of her husband in 1839.</p>

<p>"Behold finally the title of the new book," was the
first note I had from Dickens (12th of November) after
our return; "don't lose it, for I have no copy." Title
and even story had been undetermined while we travelled,
from the lingering wish he still had to begin it
among those Cornish scenes; but this intention had
now been finally abandoned, and the reader lost nothing
by his substitution for the lighthouse or mine in
Cornwall, of the Wiltshire-village forge on the windy
autumn evening which opens the tale of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.
Into that name he finally settled, but only after
much deliberation, as a mention of his changes will
show. Martin was the prefix to all, but the surname
varied from its first form of Sweezleden, Sweezleback,
and Sweezlewag, to those of Chuzzletoe, Chuzzleboy,
Chubblewig, and Chuzzlewig; nor was Chuzzlewit chosen
at last until after more hesitation and discussion. What
he had sent me in his letter as finally adopted, ran thus:
"The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewig, his
family, friends, and enemies. Comprising all his wills
and his ways. With an historical record of what he did
and what he didn't. The whole forming a complete key
to the house of Chuzzlewig." All which latter portion
of the title was of course dropped as the work became
modified, in its progress, by changes at first not contemplated;
but as early as the third number he sent me
the plan of "old Martin's plot to degrade and punish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_45" id="Page_2_45">[45]</a></span>
Pecksniff," and the difficulties he encountered in departing
from other portions of his scheme were such as
to render him, in his subsequent stories, more bent upon
constructive care at the outset, and adherence as far as
might be to any design he had formed.</p>

<p>The first number, which appeared in January 1843,
had not been quite finished when he wrote to me on
the 8th of December: "The Chuzzlewit copy makes
so much more than I supposed, that the number is
nearly done. Thank God!" Beginning so hurriedly
as at last he did, altering his course at the opening and
seeing little as yet of the main track of his design,
perhaps no story was ever begun by him with stronger
heart or confidence. Illness kept me to my rooms for
some days, and he was so eager to try the effect of
Pecksniff and Pinch that he came down with the ink
hardly dry on the last slip to read the manuscript to
me. Well did Sydney Smith, in writing to say how
very much the number had pleased him, foresee the
promise there was in those characters. "Pecksniff and
his daughters, and Pinch, are admirable&mdash;quite first-rate
painting, such as no one but yourself can execute!"
And let me here at once remark that the
notion of taking Pecksniff for a type of character was
really the origin of the book; the design being to
show, more or less by every person introduced, the
number and variety of humours and vices that have
their root in selfishness.</p>

<p>Another piece of his writing that claims mention
at the close of 1842 was a prologue contributed to
the <i>Patrician's Daughter</i>, Mr. Westland Marston's first
dramatic effort, which had attracted him by the beauty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_46" id="Page_2_46">[46]</a></span>
of its composition less than by the courage with which
its subject had been chosen from the actual life of the
time.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Not light its import, and not poor its mien;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Yourselves the actors, and your homes the scene."</span><br />
</div>

<p>This was the date, too, of Mr. Browning's tragedy
of the <i>Blot on the 'Scutcheon</i>, which I took upon myself,
after reading it in the manuscript, privately to
impart to Dickens; and I was not mistaken in the
belief that it would profoundly touch him. "Browning's
play," he wrote (25th of November), "has thrown
me into a perfect passion of sorrow. To say that there
is anything in its subject save what is lovely, true,
deeply affecting, full of the best emotion, the most
earnest feeling, and the most true and tender source of
interest, is to say that there is no light in the sun, and
no heat in blood. It is full of genius, natural and
great thoughts, profound and yet simple and beautiful
in its vigour. I know nothing that is so affecting,
nothing in any book I have ever read, as Mildred's
recurrence to that 'I was so young&mdash;I had no mother.'
I know no love like it, no passion like it, no moulding
of a splendid thing after its conception, like it. And
I swear it is a tragedy that <span class="smcap">must</span> be played; and must
be played, moreover, by Macready. There are some
things I would have changed if I could (they are very
slight, mostly broken lines); and I assuredly would
have the old servant <i>begin his tale upon the scene;</i> and
be taken by the throat, or drawn upon, by his master,
in its commencement. But the tragedy I never shall
forget, or less vividly remember than I do now. And
if you tell Browning that I have seen it, tell him that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_47" id="Page_2_47">[47]</a></span>
I believe from my soul there is no man living (and
not many dead) who could produce such a work.&mdash;Macready
likes the altered prologue very much."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
There will come a more convenient time to speak of
his general literary likings, or special regard for contemporary
books; but I will say now that nothing interested
him more than successes won honestly in his
own field, and that in his large and open nature there
was no hiding-place for little jealousies. An instance
occurs to me which may be named at once, when,
many years after the present date, he called my attention
very earnestly to two tales then in course of publication
in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, and afterwards collected
under the title of <i>Scenes of Clerical Life</i>. "Do
read them," he wrote. "They are the best things I
have seen since I began my course."</p>

<p>Eighteen hundred and forty-three<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> opened with the
most vigorous prosecution of his <i>Chuzzlewit</i> labour.
"I hope the number will be very good," he wrote to
me of number two (8th of January). "I have been
hammering away, and at home all day. Ditto <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'yester-[page break]terday'">yesterday</ins>;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_48" id="Page_2_48">[48]</a></span>
except for two hours in the afternoon, when I
ploughed through snow half a foot deep, round about
the wilds of Willesden." For the present, however,
I shall glance only briefly from time to time at his
progress with the earlier portions of the story on which
he was thus engaged until the midsummer of 1844.
Disappointments arose in connection with it, unexpected
and strange, which had important influence
upon him: but, I reserve the mention of these for
awhile, that I may speak of the leading incidents of
1843.</p>

<p>"I am in a difficulty," he wrote (12th of February),
"and am coming down to you some time to-day or to-night.
I couldn't write a line yesterday; not a word,
though I really tried hard. In a kind of despair I
started off at half-past two with my pair of petticoats to
Richmond; and dined there!! Oh what a lovely day
it was in those parts." His pair of petticoats were
Mrs. Dickens and her sister Georgina: the latter,
since his return from America, having become part of
his household, of which she remained a member until
his death; and he had just reason to be proud of the
steadiness, depth, and devotion of her friendship. In
a note-book begun by him in January 1855, where, for
the first time in his life, he jotted down hints and
fancies proposed to be made available in future writings,
I find a character sketched of which, if the whole
was not suggested by his sister-in-law, the most part
was applicable to her. "She&mdash;sacrificed to children,
and sufficiently rewarded. From a child herself, always
'the children' (of somebody else) to engross her.
And so it comes to pass that she is never married;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_49" id="Page_2_49">[49]</a></span>
never herself has a child; is always devoted 'to the
children' (of somebody else); and they love her;
and she has always youth dependent on her till her
death&mdash;and dies quite happily." Not many days after
that holiday at Richmond, a slight unstudied outline in
pencil was made by Maclise of the three who formed
the party there, as we all sat together; and never did
a touch so light carry with it more truth of observation.
The likenesses of all are excellent; and I here preserve
the drawing because nothing ever done of Dickens
himself has conveyed more vividly his look and bearing
at this yet youthful time. He is in his most pleasing
aspect; flattered, if you will; but nothing that is
known to me gives a general impression so life-like and
true of the then frank, eager, handsome face.</p>

<p>It was a year of much illness with me, which had
ever-helpful and active sympathy from him. "Send
me word how you are," he wrote, two days later.
"But not so much for that I now write, as to tell you,
peremptorily, that I insist on your wrapping yourself
up and coming here in a hackney-coach, with a big
portmanteau, to-morrow. It surely is better to be unwell
with a Quick and Cheerful (and Co) in the neighbourhood,
than in the dreary vastness of Lincoln's-inn-fields.
Here is the snuggest tent-bedstead in the
world, and there you are with the drawing-room for
your workshop, the Q and C for your pal, and 'every-think
in a concatenation accordingly.' I begin to
have hopes of the regeneration of mankind after the
reception of Gregory last night, though I have none of
the <i>Chronicle</i> for not denouncing the villain. Have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_50" id="Page_2_50">[50]</a></span>
you seen the note touching my <i>Notes</i> in the blue and
yellow?"</p>

<p>The first of these closing allusions was to the editor
of the infamous <i>Satirist</i> having been hissed from the
Drury-lane stage, on which he had presented himself
in the character of Hamlet; and I remember with
what infinite pleasure I afterwards heard Chief Justice
Tindal in court, charging the jury in an action brought
by this malefactor against a publican of St. Giles's for
having paid men to take part in the hissing of him,
avow the pride he felt in "living in the same parish
with a man of that humble station of life of the defendant's,"
who was capable of paying money out of his
own pocket to punish what he believed to be an outrage
to decency. The second allusion was to a statement
of the reviewer of the <i>American Notes</i> in the <i>Edinburgh</i>
to the effect, that, if he had been rightly informed,
Dickens had gone to America as a kind of missionary
in the cause of international copyright; to which a
prompt contradiction had been given in the <i>Times</i>.
"I deny it," wrote Dickens, "wholly. He is wrongly
informed; and reports, without enquiry, a piece of information
which I could only characterize by using one
of the shortest and strongest words in the language."</p>

<p>The disputes that had arisen out of the American
book, I may add, stretched over great part of the year.
It will quite suffice, however, to say here that the
ground taken by him in his letters written on the spot,
and printed in my former volume, which in all the
more material statements his book invited public judgment
upon and which he was moved to reopen in
<i>Chuzzlewit</i>, was so kept by him against all comers, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_51" id="Page_2_51">[51]</a></span>
none of the counter-statements or arguments dislodged
him from a square inch of it. But the controversy is
dead now; and he took occasion, on his later visit to
America, to write its epitaph.</p>

<p>Though I did not, to revert to his February letter,
obey its cordial bidding by immediately taking up
quarters with him, I soon after joined him at a cottage
he rented in Finchley; and here, walking and talking
in the green lanes as the midsummer months were
coming on, his introduction of Mrs. Gamp, and the
uses to which he should apply that remarkable personage,
first occurred to him. In his preface to the
book he speaks of her as a fair representation, at the
time it was published, of the hired attendant on the
poor in sickness: but he might have added that the
rich were no better off, for Mrs. Gamp's original was
in reality a person hired by a most distinguished friend
of his own, a lady, to take charge of an invalid very
dear to her; and the common habit of this nurse in
the sick room, among other Gampish peculiarities, was
to rub her nose along the top of the tall fender.
Whether or not, on that first mention of her, I had
any doubts whether such a character could be made a
central figure in his story, I do not now remember;
but if there were any at the time, they did not outlive
the contents of the packet which introduced her to me
in the flesh a few weeks after our return. "Tell me,"
he wrote from Yorkshire, where he had been meanwhile
passing pleasant holiday with a friend, "what
you think of Mrs. Gamp? You'll not find it easy to
get through the hundreds of misprints in her conversation,
but I want your opinion at once. I think you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_52" id="Page_2_52">[52]</a></span>
know already something of mine. I mean to make a
mark with her." The same letter enclosed me a clever
and pointed little parable in verse which he had written
for an annual edited by Lady Blessington.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_53" id="Page_2_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<p>Another allusion in the February letter reminds me
of the interest which his old work for the <i>Chronicle</i>
gave him in everything affecting its credit, and that
this was the year when Mr. John Black ceased to be
its editor, in circumstances reviving strongly all Dickens's
sympathies. "I am deeply grieved" (3rd of
May, 1843) "about Black. Sorry from my heart's
core. If I could find him out, I would go and comfort
him this moment." He did find him out; and
he and a certain number of us did also comfort this
excellent man after a fashion extremely English, by
giving him a Greenwich dinner on the 20th of May;
when Dickens had arranged and ordered all to perfection,
and the dinner succeeded in its purpose, as in
other ways, quite wonderfully. Among the entertainers
were Sheil and Thackeray, Fonblanque and Charles
Buller, Southwood Smith and William Johnson Fox,
Macready and Maclise, as well as myself and Dickens.</p>

<p>There followed another similar celebration, in which
one of these entertainers was the guest and which
owed hardly less to Dickens's exertions, when, at the
Star-and-garter at Richmond in the autumn, we wished
Macready good-speed on his way to America. Dickens
took the chair at that dinner; and with Stanfield,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_54" id="Page_2_54">[54]</a></span>
Maclise, and myself, was in the following week to
have accompanied the great actor to Liverpool to say
good-bye to him on board the Cunard ship, and bring
his wife back to London after their leave-taking; when
a word from our excellent friend Captain Marryat,
startling to all of us except Dickens himself, struck
him out of our party. Marryat thought that Macready
might suffer in the States by any public mention of
his having been attended on his way by the author
of the <i>American Notes</i> and <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>, and
our friend at once agreed with him. "Your main and
foremost reason," he wrote to me, "for doubting
Marryat's judgment, I can at once destroy. It has
occurred to me many times; I have mentioned the
thing to Kate more than once; and I had intended
<i>not</i> to go on board, charging Radley to let nothing be
said of my being in his house. I have been prevented
from giving any expression to my fears by a misgiving
that I should seem to attach, if I did so, too much
importance to my own doings. But now that I have
Marryat at my back, I have not the least hesitation in
saying that I am certain he is right. I have very great
apprehensions that the <i>Nickleby</i> dedication will damage
Macready. Marryat is wrong in supposing it is not
printed in the American editions, for I have myself
seen it in the shop windows of several cities. If I
were to go on board with him, I have not the least
doubt that the fact would be placarded all over New
York, before he had shaved himself in Boston. And
that there are thousands of men in America who would
pick a quarrel with him on the mere statement of his
being my friend, I have no more doubt than I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_55" id="Page_2_55">[55]</a></span>
of my existence. You have only doubted Marryat
because it is impossible for <i>any man</i> to know what
they are in their own country, who has not seen them
there."</p>

<p>This letter was written from Broadstairs, whither he
had gone in August, after such help as he only could
give, and never took such delight as in giving, to a
work of practical humanity. Earlier in the year he
had presided at a dinner for the Printers' Pension-fund,
which Thomas Hood, Douglas Jerrold, and myself
attended with him; and upon the terrible summer-evening
accident at sea by which Mr. Elton the actor
lost his life, it was mainly by Dickens's unremitting
exertions, seconded admirably by Mr. Serle and warmly
taken up by Mr. Elton's own profession (the most
generous in the world), that ample provision was made
for the many children. At the close of August I had
news of him from his favourite watering-place, too
characteristic to be omitted. The day before had been
a day of "terrific heat," yet this had not deterred him
from doing what he was too often suddenly prone to
do in the midst of his hardest work. "I performed
an insane match against time of eighteen miles by the
milestones in four hours and a half, under a burning
sun the whole way. I could get" (he is writing next
morning) "no sleep at night, and really began to be
afraid I was going to have a fever. You may judge in
what kind of authorship-training I am to-day. I could
as soon eat the cliff as write about anything." A few
days later, however, all was well again; and another
sketch from himself, to his American friend, will show
his sea-side life in ordinary. "In a bay-window in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_56" id="Page_2_56">[56]</a></span>
one-pair sits, from nine o'clock to one, a gentleman
with rather long hair and no neckcloth, who writes and
grins as if he thought he were very funny indeed. At
one he disappears, presently emerges from a bathing-machine,
and may be seen, a kind of salmon-coloured
porpoise, splashing about in the ocean. After that he
may be viewed in another bay-window on the ground
floor, eating a strong lunch; and after that, walking a
dozen miles or so, or lying on his back in the sand
reading a book. Nobody bothers him unless they know
he is disposed to be talked to; and I am told he is very
comfortable indeed. He's as brown as a berry, and
they <i>do</i> say is a small fortune to the innkeeper who sells
beer and cold punch. But this is mere rumour. Sometimes
he goes up to London (eighty miles or so away),
and then I'm told there is a sound in Lincoln's-inn-fields
at night, as of men laughing, together with a
clinking of knives and forks and wine-glasses."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>He returned to town "for good" on Monday the
2nd of October, and from the Wednesday to the Friday
of that week was at Manchester, presiding at the
opening of its great Athen&aelig;um, when Mr. Cobden and
Mr. Disraeli also "assisted." Here he spoke mainly
on a matter always nearest his heart, the education of
the very poor. He protested against the danger of
calling a little learning dangerous; declared his preference
for the very least of the little over none at all;
proposed to substitute for the old a new doggerel,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Though house and lands be never got,<br />
Learning can give what they can <i>not;</i><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_57" id="Page_2_57">[57]</a></span></div>

<div class='unindent'>told his listeners of the real and paramount danger we
had lately taken Longfellow to see in the nightly
refuges of London, "thousands of immortal creatures
condemned without alternative or choice to tread, not
what our great poet calls the primrose path to the everlasting
bonfire, but one of jagged flints and stones laid
down by brutal ignorance;" and contrasted this with
the unspeakable consolation and blessings that a little
knowledge had shed on men of the lowest estate and
most hopeless means, "watching the stars with Ferguson
the shepherd's boy, walking the streets with Crabbe,
a poor barber here in Lancashire with Arkwright, a
tallow-chandler's son with Franklin, shoemaking with
Bloomfield in his garret, following the plough with
Burns, and, high above the noise of loom and hammer,
whispering courage in the ears of workers I could
this day name in Sheffield and in Manchester."</div>

<p>The same spirit impelled him to give eager welcome
to the remarkable institution of Ragged schools, which,
begun by a shoemaker of Southampton and a chimney-sweep
of Windsor and carried on by a peer of the
realm, has had results of incalculable importance to
society. The year of which I am writing was its first,
as this in which I write is its last; and in the interval,
out of three hundred thousand children to whom it has
given some sort of education, it is computed also to
have given to a third of that number the means of
honest employment.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> "I sent Miss Coutts," he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_58" id="Page_2_58">[58]</a></span>
written (24th of September), "a sledge hammer account
of the Ragged schools; and as I saw her name
for two hundred pounds in the clergy education subscription-list,
took pains to show her that religious
mysteries and difficult creeds wouldn't do for such
pupils. I told her, too, that it was of immense importance
they should be <i>washed</i>. She writes back to
know what the rent of some large airy premises would
be, and what the expense of erecting a regular bathing
or purifying place; touching which points I am in correspondence
with the authorities. I have no doubt she
will do whatever I ask her in the matter. She is a
most excellent creature, I protest to God, and I have a
most perfect affection and respect for her."</p>

<p>One of the last things he did at the close of the year,
in the like spirit, was to offer to describe the Ragged
schools for the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. "I have told
Napier," he wrote to me, "I will give a description of
them in a paper on education, if the <i>Review</i> is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_59" id="Page_2_59">[59]</a></span>
afraid to take ground against the church catechism and
other mere formularies and subtleties, in reference to
the education of the young and ignorant. I fear it is
extremely improbable it will consent to commit itself
so far." His fears were well-founded; but the statements
then made by him give me opportunity to add
that it was his impatience of differences on this point
with clergymen of the Established Church that had led
him, for the past year or two, to take sittings in the
Little Portland-street Unitarian chapel; for whose
officiating minister, Mr. Edward Tagart, he had a
friendly regard which continued long after he had
ceased to be a member of his congregation. That he
did so quit it, after two or three years, I can distinctly
state; and of the frequent agitation of his mind and
thoughts in connection with this all-important theme,
there will be other occasions to speak. But upon essential
points he had never any sympathy so strong as with
the leading doctrine and discipline of the Church of
England; to these, as time went on, he found himself
able to accommodate all minor differences; and the
unswerving faith in Christianity itself, apart from sects
and schisms, which had never failed him at any period
of his life, found expression at its close in the language
of his will. Twelve months before his death, these
words were written. "I direct that my name be inscribed
in plain English letters on my tomb .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
conjure my friends on no account to make me the subject
of any monument, memorial, or testimonial whatever.
I rest my claim to the remembrance of my country
on my published works, and to the remembrance of my
friends upon their experience of me in addition thereto.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_60" id="Page_2_60">[60]</a></span>
I commit my soul to the mercy of God, through our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; and I exhort my dear
children humbly to try to guide themselves by the
teaching of the New Testament in its broad spirit, and
to put no faith in any man's narrow construction of its
letter here or there."</p>

<p>Active as he had been in the now ending year, and
great as were its varieties of employment; his genius in
its highest mood, his energy unwearied in good work,
and his capacity for enjoyment without limit; he was
able to signalize its closing months by an achievement
supremely fortunate, which but for disappointments the
year had also brought might never have been thought
of. He had not begun until a week after his return
from Manchester, where the fancy first occurred to him,
and before the end of November he had finished, his
memorable <i>Christmas Carol</i>. It was the work of such
odd moments of leisure as were left him out of the time
taken up by two numbers of his <i>Chuzzlewit;</i> and though
begun with but the special design of adding something
to the <i>Chuzzlewit</i> balance, I can testify to the accuracy
of his own account of what befell him in its composition,
with what a strange mastery it seized him for itself,
how he wept over it, and laughed, and wept again, and
excited himself to an extraordinary degree, and how he
walked thinking of it fifteen and twenty miles about
the black streets of London, many and many a night
after all sober folks had gone to bed. And when it
was done, as he told our friend Mr. Felton in America,
he let himself loose like a madman. "Forster is out
again," he added, by way of illustrating our practical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_61" id="Page_2_61">[61]</a></span>
comments on his celebration of the jovial old season,
"and if he don't go in again after the manner in which
we have been keeping Christmas, he must be very
strong indeed. Such dinings, such dancings, such conjurings,
such blind-man's-buffings, such theatre-goings,
such kissings-out of old years and kissings-in of new
ones, never took place in these parts before."</p>

<p>Yet had it been to him, this closing year, a time also
of much anxiety and strange disappointments of which
I am now to speak; and before, with that view, we go
back for a while to its earlier months, one step into the
new year may be taken for what marked it with interest
and importance to him. Eighteen hundred and
forty-four was but fifteen days old when a third son
(his fifth child, which received the name of its godfather
Francis Jeffrey) was born; and here is an answer
sent by him, two days later, to an invitation from
Maclise, Stanfield, and myself to dine with us at Richmond.
"<span class="smcap">Devonshire Lodge</span>, <i>Seventeenth of January</i>,

you have honoured me, awakens within my breast emotions

Heaven bless you. I shall indeed be proud, my friends,
to respond to such a requisition. I had withdrawn
from Public Life&mdash;I fondly thought forever&mdash;to pass
the evening of my days in hydropathical pursuits, and

<div class="blockquot">Sale of <i>Chuzzlewit</i>&mdash;Publishers and Authors&mdash;Unlucky Clause in

<p><span class="smcap">Chuzzlewit</span> had fallen short of all the expectations
formed of it in regard to sale. By much the most
masterly of his writings hitherto, the public had rallied
to it in far less numbers than to any of its predecessors.
The primary cause of this, there is little doubt, had
been the change to weekly issues in the form of publication
of his last two stories; for into everything in
this world mere habit enters more largely than we are
apt to suppose. Nor had the temporary withdrawal to
America been favourable to an immediate resumption
by his readers of their old and intimate relations.
This also is to be added, that the excitement by
which a popular reputation is kept up to the highest
selling mark, will always be subject to lulls too capricious
for explanation. But whatever the causes, here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_64" id="Page_2_64">[64]</a></span>
was the undeniable fact of a grave depreciation of sale
in his writings, unaccompanied by any falling off either
in themselves or in the writer's reputation. It was very
temporary; but it was present, and to be dealt with
accordingly. The forty and fifty thousand purchasers
of <i>Pickwick</i> and <i>Nickleby</i>, the sixty and seventy thousand
of the early numbers of the enterprize in which
the <i>Old Curiosity Shop</i> and <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> appeared,
had fallen to little over twenty thousand. They rose
somewhat on Martin's ominous announcement, at the
end of the fourth number, that he'd <i>go to America;</i>
but though it was believed that this resolve, which
Dickens adopted as suddenly as his hero, might increase
the number of his readers, that reason influenced
him less than the challenge to make good his <i>Notes</i>
which every mail had been bringing him from unsparing
assailants beyond the Atlantic. The substantial
effect of the American episode upon the sale was yet
by no means great. A couple of thousand additional
purchasers were added, but the highest number at any
time reached before the story closed was twenty-three
thousand. Its sale, since, has ranked next after <i>Pickwick</i>
and <i>Copperfield</i>.</p>

<p>We were now, however, to have a truth brought
home to us which few that have had real or varied experience
in such matters can have failed to be impressed
by&mdash;that publishers are bitter bad judges of an author,
and are seldom safe persons to consult in regard to the
fate or fortunes that may probably await him. Describing
the agreement for this book in September 1841, I
spoke of a provision against the improbable event
of its profits proving inadequate to certain necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_65" id="Page_2_65">[65]</a></span>
repayments. In this unlikely case, which was to be
ascertained by the proceeds of the first five numbers,
the publishers were to have power to appropriate fifty
pounds a month out of the two hundred pounds payable
for authorship in the expenses of each number;
but though this had been introduced with my knowledge,
I knew also too much of the antecedent relations
of the parties to regard it as other than a mere form to
satisfy the attorneys in the case. The fifth number,
which landed Martin and Mark in America, and the
sixth, which described their first experiences, were published;
and on the eve of the seventh, in which Mrs.
Gamp was to make her first appearance, I heard with
infinite pain that from Mr. Hall, the younger partner
of the firm which had enriched itself by <i>Pickwick</i> and
<i>Nickleby</i>, and a very kind well-disposed man, there had
dropped an inconsiderate hint to the writer of those
books that it might be desirable to put the clause in
force. It had escaped him without his thinking of all
that it involved; certainly the senior partner, whatever
amount of as thoughtless sanction he had at the moment
given to it, always much regretted it, and made endeavours
to exhibit his regret; but the mischief was
done, and for the time was irreparable.</p>

<p>"I am so irritated," Dickens wrote to me on the
28th of June, "so rubbed in the tenderest part of my
eyelids with bay-salt, by what I told you yesterday,
that a wrong kind of fire is burning in my head, and I
don't think I <i>can</i> write. Nevertheless, I am trying. In
case I should succeed, and should not come down to
you this morning, shall you be at the club or elsewhere
after dinner? I am bent on paying the money. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_66" id="Page_2_66">[66]</a></span>
before going into the matter with anybody I should like
you to propound from me the one preliminary question
to Bradbury and Evans. It is more than a year and a
half since Clowes wrote to urge me to give him a hearing,
in case I should ever think of altering my plans.
A printer is better than a bookseller, and it is quite as
much the interest of one (if not more) to join me. But
whoever it is, or whatever, I am bent upon paying
Chapman and Hall <i>down</i>. And when I have done that,
Mr. Hall shall have a piece of my mind."</p>

<p>What he meant by the proposed repayment will be
understood by what formerly was said of his arrangements
with these gentlemen on the repurchase of his
early copyrights. Feeling no surprise at this announcement,
I yet prevailed with him to suspend proceedings
until his return from Broadstairs in October; and what
then I had to say led to memorable resolves. The
communication he had desired me to make to his
printers had taken them too much by surprise to enable
them to form a clear judgment respecting it; and they
replied by suggestions which were in effect a confession
of that want of confidence in themselves. They enlarged
upon the great results that would follow a reissue
of his writings in a cheap form; they strongly
urged such an undertaking; and they offered to invest
to any desired amount in the establishment of a magazine
or other periodical to be edited by him. The
possible dangers, in short, incident to their assuming
the position of publishers as well as printers of new
works from his pen, seemed at first to be so much
greater than on closer examination they were found to
be, that at the outset they shrank from encountering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_67" id="Page_2_67">[67]</a></span>
them. And hence the remarkable letter I shall now
quote (1st of November, 1843).</p>

<p>"Don't be startled by the novelty and extent of
my project. Both startled <i>me</i> at first; but I am well
assured of its wisdom and necessity. I am afraid of a
magazine&mdash;just now. I don't think the time a good
one, or the chances favourable. I am afraid of putting
myself before the town as writing tooth and nail for
bread, headlong, after the close of a book taking so
much out of one as <i>Chuzzlewit</i>. I am afraid I could
not do it, with justice to myself. I know that whatever
we may say at first, a new magazine, or a new anything,
would require so much propping, that I should
be <i>forced</i> (as in the <i>Clock</i>) to put myself into it, in my
old shape. I am afraid of Bradbury and Evans's desire
to force on the cheap issue of my books, or any of
them, prematurely. I am sure if it took place yet
awhile, it would damage me and damage the property,
<i>enormously</i>. It is very natural in them to want it;
but, since they do want it, I have no faith in their
regarding me in any other respect than they would regard
any other man in a speculation. I see that this is
really your opinion as well; and I don't see what I
gain, in such a case, by leaving Chapman and Hall.
If I had made money, I should unquestionably fade
away from the public eye for a year, and enlarge my
stock of description and observation by seeing countries
new to me; which it is most necessary to me that
I should see, and which with an increasing family I
can scarcely hope to see at all, unless I see them now.
Already for some time I have had this hope and intention
before me; and though not having made money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_68" id="Page_2_68">[68]</a></span>
yet, I find or fancy that I can put myself in the position
to accomplish it. And this is the course I have
before me. At the close of <i>Chuzzlewit</i> (by which time
the debt will have been materially reduced) I purpose
drawing from Chapman and Hall my share of the subscription&mdash;bills,
or money, will do equally well. I design
to tell them that it is not likely I shall do anything
for a year; that, in the meantime, I make no arrangement
whatever with any one; and our business matters
rest <i>in statu quo</i>. The same to Bradbury and Evans.
I shall let the house if I can; if not, leave it to be let.
I shall take all the family, and two servants&mdash;three at
most&mdash;to some place which I know beforehand to be
<span class="smcap">cheap</span> and in a delightful climate, in Normandy or
Brittany, to which I shall go over, first, and where I
shall rent some house for six or eight months. During
that time, I shall walk through Switzerland, cross the
Alps, travel through France and Italy; take Kate perhaps
to Rome and Venice, but not elsewhere; and in
short see everything that is to be seen. I shall write
my descriptions to you from time to time, exactly as I
did in America; and you will be able to judge whether
or not a new and attractive book may not be made on
such ground. At the same time I shall be able to turn
over the story I have in my mind, and which I have a
strong notion might be published with great advantage,
<i>first in Paris</i>&mdash;but that's another matter to be talked
over. And of course I have not yet settled, either,
whether any book about the travel, or this, should be
the first. 'All very well,' you say, 'if you had money
enough.' Well, but if I can see my way to what would
be necessary without binding myself in any form to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_69" id="Page_2_69">[69]</a></span>
anything; without paying interest, or giving any security
but one of my Eagle five thousand pounds; you
would give up that objection. And I stand committed
to no bookseller, printer, money-lender, banker, or
patron whatever; and decidedly strengthen my position
with my readers, instead of weakening it, drop by
drop, as I otherwise must. Is it not so? and is not
the way before me, plainly this? I infer that in reality
you do yourself think, that what I first thought of is
<i>not</i> the way? I have told you my scheme very badly,
as I said I would. I see its great points, against many
prepossessions the other way&mdash;as, leaving England,
home, friends, everything I am fond of&mdash;but it seems
to me, at a critical time, <i>the</i> step to set me right. A
blessing on Mr. Mariotti my Italian master, and his
pupil!&mdash;If you have any breath left, tell Topping how
you are."</p>

<p>I had certainly not much after reading this letter,
written amid all the distractions of his work, with both
the <i>Carol</i> and <i>Chuzzlewit</i> in hand; but such insufficient
breath as was left to me I spent against the project, and
in favour of far more consideration than he had given
to it, before anything should be settled. "I expected
you," he wrote next day (the 2nd of November), "to
be startled. If I was startled myself, when I first got
this project of foreign travel into my head, <span class="smcap">months</span>
AGO, how much more must you be, on whom it comes
fresh: numbering only hours! Still, I am very resolute
upon it&mdash;very. I am convinced that my expenses
abroad would not be more than half of my expenses
here; the influence of change and nature upon me,
enormous. You know, as well as I, that I think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_70" id="Page_2_70">[70]</a></span> <i>Chuzzlewit</i>
in a hundred points immeasurably the best of my
stories. That I feel my power now, more than I ever
did. That I have a greater confidence in myself than
I ever had. That I <i>know</i>, if I have health, I could
sustain my place in the minds of thinking men, though
fifty writers started up to-morrow. But how many
readers do <i>not</i> think! How many take it upon trust
from knaves and idiots, that one writes too fast, or
runs a thing to death! How coldly did this very book
go on for months, until it forced itself up in people's
opinion, without forcing itself up in sale! If I wrote
for forty thousand Forsters, or for forty thousand people
who know I write because I can't help it, I should have
no need to leave the scene. But this very book warns me
that if I <i>can</i> leave it for a time, I had better do so, and
must do so. Apart from that again, I feel that longer
rest after this story would do me good. You say two
or three months, because you have been used to see me
for eight years never leaving off. But it is not rest
enough. It is impossible to go on working the brain
to that extent for ever. The very spirit of the thing,
in doing it, leaves a horrible despondency behind,
when it is done; which must be prejudicial to the
mind, so soon renewed, and so seldom let alone. What
would poor Scott have given to have gone abroad, of
his own free will, a young man, instead of creeping
there, a driveller, in his miserable decay! I said myself
in my note to you&mdash;anticipating what you put to
me&mdash;that it was a question <i>what</i> I should come out
with, first. The travel-book, if to be done at all, would
cost me very little trouble; and surely would go very
far to pay charges, whenever published. We have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_71" id="Page_2_71">[71]</a></span>
spoken of the baby, and of leaving it here with Catherine's
mother. Moving the children into France could
not, in any ordinary course of things, do them anything
but good. And the question is, what it would
do to that by which they live: not what it would do
to them.&mdash;I had forgotten that point in the B. and E.
negociation; but they certainly suggested instant publication
of the reprints, or at all events of some of
them; by which of course I know, and as you point
out, I could provide of myself what is wanted. I take
that as putting the thing distinctly as a matter of trade,
and feeling it so. And, as a matter of trade with them
or anybody else, as a matter of trade between me and
the public, should I not be better off a year hence, with
the reputation of having seen so much in the meantime?
The reason which induces you to look upon
this scheme with dislike&mdash;separation for so long a time&mdash;surely
has equal weight with me. I see very little
pleasure in it, beyond the natural desire to have been
in those great scenes; I anticipate no enjoyment at
the time. I have come to look upon it as a matter of
policy and duty. I have a thousand other reasons, but
shall very soon myself be with you."</p>

<p>There were difficulties, still to be strongly urged,
against taking any present step to a final resolve; and
he gave way a little. But the pressure was soon renewed.
"I have been," he wrote (10th of November),
"all day in <i>Chuzzlewit</i> agonies&mdash;conceiving only.
I hope to bring forth to-morrow. Will you come here
at six? I want to say a word or two about the cover
of the <i>Carol</i> and the advertising, and to consult you
on a nice point in the tale. It will come wonderfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_72" id="Page_2_72">[72]</a></span>
I think. Mac will call here soon after, and we can
then all three go to Bulwer's together. And do, my
dear fellow, do for God's sake turn over about Chapman
and Hall, and look upon my project as a <i>settled
thing</i>. If you object to see them, I must write to
them." My reluctance as to the question affecting
his old publishers was connected with the little story,
which, amid all his perturbations and troubles and
"<i>Chuzzlewit</i> agonies," he was steadily carrying to its
close; and which remains a splendid proof of how
thoroughly he was borne out in the assertion just before
made, of the sense of his power felt by him, and
his confidence that it had never been greater than
when his readers were thus falling off from him. He
had entrusted the <i>Carol</i> for publication on his own
account, under the usual terms of commission, to the
firm he had been so long associated with; and at such
a moment to tell them, short of absolute necessity, his
intention to quit them altogether, I thought a needless
putting in peril of the little book's chances. He
yielded to this argument; but the issue, as will be
found, was less fortunate than I hoped.</p>

<p>Let disappointments or annoyances, however, beset
him as they might, once heartily in his work and all
was forgotten. His temperament of course coloured
everything, cheerful or sad, and his present outlook was
disturbed by imaginary fears; but it was very certain
that his labours and successes thus far had enriched
others more than himself, and while he knew that his
mode of living had been scrupulously governed by
what he believed to be his means, the first suspicion
that these might be inadequate made a change necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_73" id="Page_2_73">[73]</a></span>
to so upright a nature. It was the turning-point
of his career; and the issue, though not immediately,
ultimately justified him. Much of his present restlessness
I was too ready myself to ascribe to that love of
change in him which was always arising from his passionate
desire to vary and extend his observation; but
even as to this the result showed him right in believing
that he should obtain decided intellectual advantage
from the mere effects of such farther travel. Here
indeed he spoke from experience, for already he had
returned from America with wider views than when
he started, and with a larger maturity of mind. The
money difficulties on which he dwelt were also, it is
now to be admitted, unquestionable. Beyond his own
domestic expenses necessarily increasing, there were
many, never-satisfied, constantly-recurring claims from
family quarters, not the more easily avoidable because
unreasonable and unjust; and it was after describing
to me one such with great bitterness, a few days following
the letter last quoted, that he thus replied on the
following day (19th of November) to the comment I
had made upon it. "I was most horribly put out for
a little while; for I had got up early to go at it, and
was full of interest in what I had to do. But having
eased my mind by that note to you, and taken a turn
or two up and down the room, I went at it again, and
soon got so interested that I blazed away till 9 last
night; only stopping ten minutes for dinner! I suppose
I wrote eight printed pages of <i>Chuzzlewit</i> yesterday.
The consequence is that I <i>could</i> finish to-day, but am
taking it easy, and making myself laugh very much."
The very next day, unhappily, there came to himself a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_74" id="Page_2_74">[74]</a></span>
repetition of precisely similar trouble in exaggerated
form, and to me a fresh reminder of what was gradually
settling into a fixed resolve. "I am quite serious and
sober when I say, that I have very grave thoughts of
keeping my whole menagerie in Italy, three years."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Of the book which awoke such varied feelings and
was the occasion of such vicissitudes of fortune, some
notice is now due; and this, following still as yet my
former rule, will be not so much critical as biographical.
He had left for Italy before the completed tale was
published, and its reception for a time was exactly what
his just-quoted letter prefigures. It had forced itself up
in public opinion without forcing itself up in sale. It
was felt generally to be an advance upon his previous
stories, and his own opinion is not to be questioned
that it was in a hundred points immeasurably the best of
them thus far; less upon the surface, and going deeper
into springs of character. Nor would it be difficult to
say, in a single word, where the excellence lay that
gave it this superiority. It had brought his highest
faculty into play: over and above other qualities it had
given scope to his imagination; and it first expressed
the distinction in this respect between his earlier and
his later books. Apart wholly from this, too, his letters
will have confirmed a remark already made upon the
degree to which his mental power had been altogether
deepened and enlarged by the effect of his visit to
America.</p>

<p>In construction and conduct of story <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>
is defective, character and description constituting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_75" id="Page_2_75">[75]</a></span>
the chief part of its strength. But what it lost as a
story by the American episode it gained in the other
direction; young Martin, by happy use of a bitter
experience, casting off his slough of selfishness in the
poisonous swamp of Eden. Dickens often confessed,
however, the difficulty it had been to him to have to
deal with this gap in the main course of his narrative;
and I will give an instance from a letter he wrote to
me when engaged upon the number in which Jonas
brings his wife to her miserable home. "I write in
haste" (28th of July 1843), "for I have been at work
all day; and, it being against the grain with me to go
back to America when my interest is strong in the other
parts of the tale, have got on but slowly. I have a
great notion to work out with Sydney's favourite,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and
long to be at him again." But obstructions of this
kind with Dickens measured only and always the degree
of readiness and resource with which he rose to meet
them, and never had his handling of character been so
masterly as in <i>Chuzzlewit</i>. The persons delineated in
former books had been more agreeable, but never so
interpenetrated with meanings brought out with a grasp
so large, easy, and firm. As well in this as in the passionate
vividness of its descriptions, the imaginative
power makes itself felt. The windy autumn night, with
the mad desperation of the hunted leaves and the roaring
mirth of the blazing village forge; the market-day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_76" id="Page_2_76">[76]</a></span>
at Salisbury; the winter walk, and the coach journey
to London by night; the ship voyage over the Atlantic;
the stormy midnight travel before the murder, the
stealthy enterprise and cowardly return of the murderer;
these are all instances of first-rate description,
original in the design, imaginative in all the detail,
and very complete in the execution. But the higher
power to which I direct attention is even better discerned
in the persons and dialogue. With nothing
absent or abated in its sharp impressions of reality,
there are more of the subtle requisites which satisfy
reflection and thought. We have in this book for the
most part, not only observation but the outcome of it,
the knowledge as well as the fact. While we witness
as vividly the life immediately passing, we are more
conscious of the permanent life above and beyond it.
Nothing nearly so effective therefore had yet been
achieved by him. He had scrutinised as truly and
satirised as keenly; but had never shown the imaginative
insight with which he now sent his humour and
his art into the core of the vices of the time.</p>

<p>Sending me the second chapter of his eighth number
on the 15th of August, he gave me the latest tidings
from America. "I gather from a letter I have had
this morning that Martin has made them all stark
staring raving mad across the water. I wish you would
consider this. Don't you think the time has come
when I ought to state that such public entertainments
as I received in the States were either accepted before
I went out, or in the first week after my arrival there;
and that as soon as I began to have any acquaintance
with the country, I set my face against any public recognition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_77" id="Page_2_77">[77]</a></span>
whatever but that which was forced upon me
to the destruction of my peace and comfort&mdash;and made
no secret of my real sentiments." We did not agree
as to this, and the notion was abandoned; though his
correspondent had not overstated the violence of the
outbreak in the States when those chapters exploded
upon them. But though an angry they are a good
humoured and a very placable people; and, as time
moved on a little, the laughter on that side of the
Atlantic became quite as great as our amusement on
this side, at the astonishing fun and comicality of these
scenes. With a little reflection the Americans had
doubtless begun to find out that the advantage was not
all with us, nor the laughter wholly against them.</p>

<p>They had no Pecksniff at any rate. Bred in a more
poisonous swamp than their Eden, of greatly older
standing and much harder to be drained, Pecksniff was
all our own. The confession is not encouraging to
national pride, but this character is so far English,
that though our countrymen as a rule are by no means
Pecksniffs, the ruling weakness is to countenance and
encourage the race. When people call the character
exaggerated, and protest that the lines are too broad to
deceive any one, they only refuse, naturally enough, to
sanction in a book what half their lives is passed in
tolerating if not in worshipping. Dickens, illustrating
his never-failing experience of being obliged to subdue
in his books what he knew to be real for fear it should
be deemed impossible, had already made the remark in
his preface to <i>Nickleby</i>, that the world, which is so
very credulous in what professes to be true, is most incredulous
in what professes to be imaginary. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_78" id="Page_2_78">[78]</a></span>
agree to be deceived in a reality, and reward themselves
by refusing to be deceived in a fiction. That a
great many people who might have sat for Pecksniff,
should condemn him for a grotesque impossibility, as
Dickens averred to be the case, was no more than
might be expected. A greater danger he has exposed
more usefully in showing the greater numbers, who,
desiring secretly to be thought better than they are,
support eagerly pretensions that keep their own in
countenance, and, without being Pecksniffs, render
Pecksniffs possible. All impostures would have something
too suspicious or forbidding in their look if we
were not prepared to meet them half way.</p>

<p>There is one thing favourable to us however, even in
this view, which a French critic has lately suggested.
Informing us that there are no Pecksniffs to be found
in France, Mr. Taine explains this by the fact that his
countrymen have ceased to affect virtue, and pretend
only to vice; that a charlatan setting up morality
would have no sort of following; that religion and the
domestic virtues have gone so utterly to rags as not to
be worth putting on for a deceitful garment; and that,
no principles being left to parade, the only chance for
the French modern Tartuffe is to confess and exaggerate
weaknesses. We seem to have something of an advantage
here. We require at least that the respectable homage of
vice to virtue should not be omitted. "Charity, my
dear," says our English Tartuffe, upon being bluntly
called what he really is, "when I take my chamber-candlestick
to-night, remind me to be more than usually
particular in praying for Mr. Anthony Chuzzlewit, who
has done me an injustice." No amount of self-indulgence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_79" id="Page_2_79">[79]</a></span>
weakens or lowers his pious and reflective tone.
"Those are her daughters," he remarks, making maudlin
overtures to Mrs. Todgers in memory of his deceased
wife. "Mercy and Charity, Charity and Mercy, not
unholy names I hope. She was beautiful. She had a
small property." When his condition has fallen into
something so much worse than maudlin that his friends
have to put him to bed, they have not had time to
descend the staircase when he is seen to be "fluttering"
on the top landing, desiring to collect their sentiments
on the nature of human life. "Let us be moral. Let
us contemplate existence." He turns his old pupil
out of doors in the attitude of blessing him, and when
he has discharged that social duty retires to shed his
personal tribute of a few tears in the back garden. No
conceivable position, action, or utterance finds him
without the vice in which his being is entirely steeped
and saturated. Of such consummate consistency is its
practice with him, that in his own house with his
daughters he continues it to keep his hand in; and
from the mere habit of keeping up appearances, even
to himself, falls into the trap of Jonas. Thackeray used
to say that there was nothing finer in rascaldom than
this ruin of Pecksniff by his son-in-law at the very
moment when the oily hypocrite believes himself to
be achieving his masterpiece of dissembling over the
more vulgar avowed ruffian. "'Jonas!' cried Mr.
Pecksniff much affected, 'I am not a diplomatical
character; my heart is in my hand. By far the greater
part of the inconsiderable savings I have accumulated
in the course of&mdash;I hope&mdash;a not dishonourable or useless
career, is already given, devised, or bequeathed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_80" id="Page_2_80">[80]</a></span>
(correct me, my dear Jonas, if I am technically wrong),
with expressions of confidence which I will not repeat;
and in securities which it is unnecessary to mention;
to a person whom I cannot, whom I will not, whom I
need not, name.' Here he gave the hand of his son-in-law
a fervent squeeze, as if he would have added,
'God bless you: be very careful of it when you get it!'"</p>

<p>Certainly Dickens thus far had done nothing of
which, as in this novel, the details were filled in with
such minute and incomparable skill; where the wealth
of comic circumstance was lavished in such overflowing
abundance on single types of character; or where
generally, as throughout the story, the intensity of his
observation of individual humours and vices had taken
so many varieties of imaginative form. Everything in
<i>Chuzzlewit</i> indeed had grown under treatment, as will
be commonly the case in the handling of a man of
genius, who never knows where any given conception
may lead him, out of the wealth of resource in development
and incident which it has itself created. "As to
the way," he wrote to me of its two most prominent
figures, as soon as all their capabilities were revealed to
him, "As to the way in which these characters have
opened out, that is, to me, one of the most surprising
processes of the mind in this sort of invention. Given
what one knows, what one does not know springs up;
and I am as absolutely certain of its being true, as I am
of the law of gravitation&mdash;if such a thing be possible,
more so." The remark displays exactly what in all
his important characters was the very process of creation
with him.</p>

<p>Nor was it in the treatment only of his present fiction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_81" id="Page_2_81">[81]</a></span>
but also in its subject or design, that he had gone
higher than in preceding efforts. Broadly what he
aimed at, he would have expressed on the title-page if
I had not dissuaded him, by printing there as its motto
a verse altered from that prologue of his own composition
to which I have formerly referred: "Your homes
the scene. Yourselves, the actors, here!" Debtors'
prisons, parish Bumbledoms, Yorkshire schools, were
vile enough, but something much more pestiferous was
now the aim of his satire; and he had not before so
decisively shown vigour, daring, or discernment of what
lay within reach of his art, as in taking such a person
as Pecksniff for the central figure in a tale of existing
life. Setting him up as the glass through which to view
the groups around him, we are not the less moved to a
hearty detestation of the social vices they exhibit, and
pre-eminently of selfishness in all its forms, because we
see more plainly than ever that there is but one vice
which is quite irremediable. The elder Chuzzlewits are
bad enough, but they bring their self-inflicted punishments;
the Jonases and Tigg Montagues are execrable,
but the law has its halter and its penal servitude; the
Moulds and Gamps have plague-bearing breaths, from
which sanitary wisdom may clear us; but from the sleek,
smiling, crawling abomination of a Pecksniff, there is
no help but self-help. Every man's hand should be
against him, for his is against every man; and, as Mr.
Taine very wisely warns us, the virtues have most need
to be careful that they do not make themselves panders
to his vice. It is an amiable weakness to put the
best face on the worst things, but there is none more
dangerous. There is nothing so common as the mistake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_82" id="Page_2_82">[82]</a></span>
of Tom Pinch, and nothing so rare as his excuses.</p>

<p>The art with which that delightful character is placed
at Mr. Pecksniff's elbow at the beginning of the story,
and the help he gives to set fairly afloat the falsehood
he innocently believes, contribute to an excellent management
of this part of the design; and the same
prodigal wealth of invention and circumstance which
gives its higher imaginative stamp to the book, appears
as vividly in its lesser as in its leading figures. There
are wonderful touches of this suggestive kind in the
household of Mould the undertaker; and in the vivid
picture presented to us by one of Mrs. Gamp's recollections,
we are transported to the youthful games of
his children. "The sweet creeturs! playing at berryins
down in the shop, and follerin' the order-book to its
long home in the iron safe!" The American scenes
themselves are not more full of life and fun and freshness,
and do not contribute more to the general hilarity,
than the cockney group at Todgers's; which is itself a
little world of the qualities and humours that make up
the interest of human life, whether it be high or low,
vulgar or fine, filled in with a master's hand. Here,
in a mere byestroke as it were, are the very finest things
of the earlier books superadded to the new and higher
achievement that distinguished the later productions.
No part indeed of the execution of this remarkable novel
is inferior. Young Bailey and Sweedlepipes are in the
front rank of his humorous creations; and poor Mrs.
Todgers, worn but not depraved by the cares of gravy
and solicitudes of her establishment, with calculation
shining out of one eye but affection and goodheartedness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_83" id="Page_2_83">[83]</a></span>
still beaming in the other, is in her way quite as
perfect a picture as even the portentous Mrs. Gamp
with her grim grotesqueness, her filthy habits and foul
enjoyments, her thick and damp but most amazing
utterances, her moist clammy functions, her pattens,
her bonnet, her bundle, and her umbrella. But such
prodigious claims must have a special mention.</p>

<p>This world-famous personage has passed into and become
one with the language, which her own parts of
speech have certainly not exalted or refined. To none
even of Dickens's characters has there been such a run
of popularity; and she will remain among the everlasting
triumphs of fiction, a superb masterpiece of
English humour. What Mr. Mould says of her in his
enthusiasm, that she's the sort of woman one would
bury for nothing, and do it neatly too, every one feels
to be an appropriate tribute; and this, by a most
happy inspiration, is exactly what the genius to whom
she owes her existence did, when he called her into
life, to the foul original she was taken from. That
which enduringly stamped upon his page its most
mirth-moving figure, had stamped out of English life
for ever one of its disgraces. The mortal Mrs. Gamp
was handsomely put into her grave, and only the immortal
Mrs. Gamp survived. Age will not wither this
one, nor custom stale her variety. In the latter point
she has an advantage over even Mr. Pecksniff. She
has a friend, an alter ego, whose kind of service to her
is expressed by her first utterance in the story; and
with this, which introduces her, we may leave her most
fitly. "'Mrs. Harris,' I says, at the very last case as
ever I acted in, which it was but a young person, 'Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_84" id="Page_2_84">[84]</a></span>
Harris,' I says, 'leave the bottle on the chimley-piece,
and don't ask me to take none, but let me put my lips
to it when I am so dispoged.' 'Mrs. Gamp,' she says
in answer, 'if ever there was a sober creetur to be got
at eighteen pence a day for working people, and three
and six for gentlefolks&mdash;night watching,' said Mrs.
Gamp with emphasis, 'being a extra charge&mdash;you are
that inwallable person.' 'Mrs. Harris,' I says to her,
'don't name the charge, for if I could afford to lay all
my fellow-creeturs out for nothink, I would gladly do
it, sich is the love I bears 'em.'" To this there is
nothing to be added, except that in the person of that
astonishing friend every phase of fun and comedy in
the character is repeated, under fresh conditions of increased
appreciation and enjoyment. By the exuberance
of comic invention which gives his distinction to
Mr. Pecksniff, Mrs. Gamp profits quite as much; the
same wealth of laughable incident which surrounds
that worthy man is upon her heaped to overflowing;
but over and above this, by the additional invention
of Mrs. Harris, it is all reproduced, acted over with
renewed spirit, and doubled and quadrupled in her
favour. This on the whole is the happiest stroke of
humorous art in all the writings of Dickens.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>But this is a chapter of disappointments, and I have
now to state, that as <i>Martin Chuzzlewit's</i> success was
to seem to him at first only distant and problematical,
so even the prodigious immediate success of the
<i>Christmas Carol</i> itself was not to be an unmitigated
pleasure. Never had a little book an outset so full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_85" id="Page_2_85">[85]</a></span>
brilliancy of promise. Published but a few days before
Christmas, it was hailed on every side with enthusiastic
greeting. The first edition of six thousand
copies was sold the first day, and on the third of January
1844 he wrote to me that "two thousand of the
three printed for second and third editions are already
taken by the trade." But a very few weeks were to
pass before the darker side of the picture came. "Such
a night as I have passed!" he wrote to me on Saturday
morning the 10th of February. "I really believed I
should never get up again, until I had passed through
all the horrors of a fever. I found the <i>Carol</i> accounts
awaiting me, and they were the cause of it. The first
six thousand copies show a profit of &pound;230! And the
last four will yield as much more. I had set my heart
and soul upon a Thousand, clear. What a wonderful
thing it is, that such a great success should occasion
me such intolerable anxiety and disappointment! My
year's bills, unpaid, are so terrific, that all the energy
and determination I can possibly exert will be required
to clear me before I go abroad; which, if next June
come and find me alive, I shall do. Good Heaven, if
I had only taken heart a year ago! Do come soon, as
I am very anxious to talk with you. We can send
round to Mac after you arrive, and tell him to join us
at Hampstead or elsewhere. I was so utterly knocked
down last night, that I came up to the contemplation
of all these things quite bold this morning. If I can
let the house for this season, I will be off to some seaside
place as soon as a tenant offers. I am not afraid,
if I reduce my expenses; but if I do not, I shall be
ruined past all mortal hope of redemption."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_86" id="Page_2_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The ultimate result was that his publishers were
changed, and the immediate result that his departure
for Italy became a settled thing; but a word may be
said on these Carol accounts before mention is made
of his new publishing arrangements.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Want of judgment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_87" id="Page_2_87">[87]</a></span>
had been shown in not adjusting the expenses of
production with a more equable regard to the selling
price, but even as it was, before the close of the year,
he had received &pound;726 from a sale of fifteen thousand
copies; and the difference between this and the amount
realised by the same proportion of the sale of the successor
to the <i>Carol</i>, undoubtedly justified him in the
discontent now expressed. Of that second tale, as
well as of the third and fourth, more than double the
numbers of the <i>Carol</i> were at once sold, and of course
there was no complaint of any want of success: but
the truth really was, as to all the Christmas stories
issued in this form, that the price charged, while too
large for the public addressed by them, was too little
to remunerate their outlay; and when in later years
he put forth similar fancies for Christmas, charging for
them fewer pence than the shillings required for these,
he counted his purchasers, with fairly corresponding
gains to himself, not by tens but by hundreds of thousands.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>It was necessary now that negotiations should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_88" id="Page_2_88">[88]</a></span>
resumed with his printers, but before any step was
taken Messrs. Chapman and Hall were informed of his
intention not to open fresh publishing relations with
them after <i>Chuzzlewit</i> should have closed. Then followed
deliberations and discussions, many and grave,
which settled themselves at last into the form of an
agreement with Messrs. Bradbury and Evans executed
on the first of June 1844; by which, upon advance
made to him of &pound;2800, he assigned to them a fourth
share in whatever he might write during the next ensuing
eight years, to which the agreement was to be
strictly limited. There were the usual protecting
clauses, but no interest was to be paid, and no obligations
were imposed as to what works should be
written, if any, or the form of them; the only farther
stipulation having reference to the event of a periodical
being undertaken whereof Dickens might be only
partially editor or author, in which case his proprietorship
of copyright and profits was to be two thirds
instead of three fourths. There was an understanding,
at the time this agreement was signed, that a successor
to the <i>Carol</i> would be ready for the Christmas of 1844;
but no other promise was asked or made in regard to
any other book, nor had he himself decided what
form to give to his experiences of Italy, if he should
even finally determine to publish them at all.</p>

<p>Between this agreement and his journey six weeks
elapsed, and there were one or two characteristic incidents
before his departure: but mention must first be
interposed of the success quite without alloy that also
attended the little book, and carried off in excitement
and delight every trace of doubt or misgiving.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_89" id="Page_2_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blessings on your kind heart!" wrote Jeffrey to
the author of the <i>Carol</i>. "You should be happy yourself,
for you may be sure you have done more good by
this little publication, fostered more kindly feelings, and
prompted more positive acts of beneficence, than can
be traced to all the pulpits and confessionals in Christendom
since Christmas 1842." "Who can listen,"
exclaimed Thackeray, "to objections regarding such a
book as this? It seems to me a national benefit, and
to every man or woman who reads it a personal kindness."
Such praise expressed what men of genius felt
and said; but the small volume had other tributes,
less usual and not less genuine. There poured upon
its author daily, all through that Christmas time, letters
from complete strangers to him which I remember
reading with a wonder of pleasure; not literary at
all, but of the simplest domestic kind; of which the
general burden was to tell him, amid many confidences
about their homes, how the <i>Carol</i> had come
to be read aloud there, and was to be kept upon a
little shelf by itself, and was to do them all no end
of good. Anything more to be said of it will not add
much to this.</p>

<p>There was indeed nobody that had not some interest
in the message of the <i>Christmas Carol</i>. It told the
selfish man to rid himself of selfishness; the just man
to make himself generous; and the good-natured man
to enlarge the sphere of his good nature. Its cheery
voice of faith and hope, ringing from one end of the
island to the other, carried pleasant warning alike to
all, that if the duties of Christmas were wanting no
good could come of its outward observances; that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_90" id="Page_2_90">[90]</a></span>
must shine upon the cold hearth and warm it, and into
the sorrowful heart and comfort it; that it must be
kindness, benevolence, charity, mercy, and forbearance,
or its plum pudding would turn to bile, and its
roast beef be indigestible.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Nor could any man have
said it with the same appropriateness as Dickens. What
was marked in him to the last was manifest now. He
had identified himself with Christmas fancies. Its life
and spirits, its humour in riotous abundance, of right
belonged to him. Its imaginations as well as kindly
thoughts were his; and its privilege to light up with
some sort of comfort the squalidest places, he had
made his own. Christmas Day was not more social or
welcome: New Year's Day not more new: Twelfth
Night not more full of characters. The duty of diffusing
enjoyment had never been taught by a more
abundant, mirthful, thoughtful, ever-seasonable writer.</p>

<p>Something also is to be said of the spirit of the book,
and of the others that followed it, which will not anticipate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_91" id="Page_2_91">[91]</a></span>
special allusions to be made hereafter. No one
was more intensely fond than Dickens of old nursery
tales, and he had a secret delight in feeling that he was
here only giving them a higher form. The social and
manly virtues he desired to teach, were to him not less
the charm of the ghost, the goblin, and the fairy fancies
of his childhood; however rudely set forth in
those earlier days. What now were to be conquered
were the more formidable dragons and giants which
had their places at our own hearths, and the weapons
to be used were of a finer than the "ice-brook's temper."
With brave and strong restraints, what is evil
in ourselves was to be subdued; with warm and gentle
sympathies, what is bad or unreclaimed in others was
to be redeemed; the Beauty was to embrace the Beast,
as in the divinest of all those fables; the star was to
rise out of the ashes, as in our much-loved Cinderella;
and we were to play the Valentine with our wilder
brothers, and bring them back with brotherly care to
civilization and happiness. Nor is it to be doubted, I
think, that, in that largest sense of benefit, great public
and private service was done; positive, earnest, practical
good; by the extraordinary popularity, and nearly
universal acceptance, which attended these little holiday
volumes. They carried to countless firesides, with
new enjoyment of the season, better apprehension of
its claims and obligations; they mingled grave with
glad thoughts, much to the advantage of both; what
seemed almost too remote to meddle with they brought
within reach of the charities, and what was near they
touched with a dearer tenderness; they comforted the
generous, rebuked the sordid, cured folly by kindly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_92" id="Page_2_92">[92]</a></span>
ridicule and comic humour, and, saying to their readers
<i>Thus you have done, but it were better Thus</i>, may for
some have realised the philosopher's famous experience,
and by a single fortunate thought revised the whole
manner of a life. Criticism here is a second-rate thing,
and the reader may be spared such discoveries as it
might have made in regard to the <i>Christmas Carol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_93" id="Page_2_93">[93]</a></span></i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now, before accompanying Dickens on his
Italian travel, one or two parting incidents will receive
illustration from his letters. A thoughtful little poem
written during the past summer for Lady Blessington
has been quoted on a previous page: and it may remind
me to say here what warmth of regard he had for her,
and for all the inmates of Gore-house; how uninterruptedly
joyous and pleasurable were his associations
with them; and what valued help they now gave in his
preparations for Italy. The poem, as we have seen,
was written during a visit made in Yorkshire to the
house of Mr. Smithson, already named as the partner
of his early companion, Mr. Mitton; and this visit he
repeated in sadder circumstances during the present
year, when (April 1844) he attended Mr. Smithson's
funeral. With members or connections of the family
of this friend, his intercourse long continued.</p>

<p>In the previous February, on the 26th and 28th respectively,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_94" id="Page_2_94">[94]</a></span>
he had taken the chair at two great meetings,
in Liverpool of the Mechanics' Institution, and in Birmingham
of the Polytechnic Institution, to which reference
is made by him in a letter of the 21st. I quote
the allusion because it shows thus early the sensitive
regard to his position as a man of letters, and his scrupulous
consideration for the feelings as well as interest
of the class, which he manifested in many various and
often greatly self-sacrificing ways all through his life.
"Advise me on the following point. And as I must
write to-night, having already lost a post, advise me by
bearer. This Liverpool Institution, which is wealthy
and has a high grammar-school the masters of which
receive in salaries upwards of &pound;2000 a year (indeed its
extent horrifies me; I am struggling through its papers
this morning), writes me yesterday by its secretary a
business letter about the order of the proceedings on
Monday; and it begins thus. 'I beg to send you prefixed,
with the best respects of our committee, a bank
order for twenty pounds in payment of the expenses
contingent on your visit to Liverpool.'&mdash;And there,
sure enough, it is. Now my impulse was, <i>and is</i>, decidedly
to return it. Twenty pounds is not of moment
to me; and any sacrifice of independence is worth it
twenty times' twenty times told. But haggling in my
mind is a doubt whether that would be proper, and not
boastful (in an inexplicable way); and whether as an
author, I have a right to put myself on a basis which
the professors of literature in other forms <i>connected
with the Institution</i> cannot afford to occupy. Don't
you see? But of course you do. The case stands
thus. The Manchester Institution, being in debt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_95" id="Page_2_95">[95]</a></span>
appeals to me as it were <i>in form&acirc; pauperis</i>, and makes
no such provision as I have named. The Birmingham
Institution, just struggling into life with great difficulty,
applies to me on the same grounds. But the Leeds
people (thriving) write to me, making the expenses a
distinct matter of business; and the Liverpool, as a
point of delicacy, say nothing about it to the last
minute, and then send the money. Now, what in the
name of goodness ought I to do?&mdash;I am as much
puzzled with the cheque as Colonel Jack was with his
gold. If it would have settled the matter to put it in
the fire yesterday, I should certainly have done it.
Your opinion is requested. I think I shall have grounds
for a very good speech at Brummagem; but I am not
sure about Liverpool: having misgivings of over-gentility."
My opinion was clearly for sending the money
back, which accordingly was done.</p>

<p>Both speeches, duly delivered to enthusiastic listeners
at the places named, were good, and both, with suitable
variations, had the same theme: telling his popular audience
in Birmingham that the principle of their institute,
education comprehensive and unsectarian, was the
only safe one, for that without danger no society could
go on punishing men for preferring vice to virtue without
giving them the means of knowing what virtue was;
and reminding his genteeler audience in Liverpool, that
if happily they had been themselves well taught, so
much the more should they seek to extend the benefit
to all, since, whatever the precedence due to rank,
wealth, or intellect, there was yet a nobility beyond
them, expressed unaffectedly by the poet's verse and in
the power of education to confer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_96" id="Page_2_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>He underwent some suffering, which he might have
spared himself, at his return. "I saw the <i>Carol</i> last
night," he wrote to me of a dramatic performance of
the little story at the Adelphi. "Better than usual,
and Wright seems to enjoy Bob Cratchit, but <i>heart-breaking</i>
to me. Oh Heaven! if any forecast of <i>this</i>
was ever in my mind! Yet O. Smith was drearily better
than I expected. It is a great comfort to have that
kind of meat under done; and his face is quite perfect."
Of what he suffered from these adaptations of his
books, multiplied remorselessly at every theatre, I have
forborne to speak, but it was the subject of complaint
with him incessantly; and more or less satisfied as he
was with individual performances, such as Mr. Yates's
Quilp or Mantalini and Mrs. Keeley's Smike or Dot,
there was only one, that of Barnaby Rudge by the Miss
Fortescue who became afterwards Lady Gardner, on
which I ever heard him dwell with a thorough liking.
It is true that to the dramatizations of his next and
other following Christmas stories he gave help himself;
but, even then, all such efforts to assist special representations
were mere attempts to render more tolerable
what he had no power to prevent, and, with a few rare
exceptions, they were never very successful. Another
and graver wrong was the piracy of his writings, every
one of which had been reproduced with merely such
colourable changes of title, incidents, and names of
characters, as were believed to be sufficient to evade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_97" id="Page_2_97">[97]</a></span>
the law and adapt them to "penny" purchasers. So
shamelessly had this been going on ever since the days
of <i>Pickwick</i>, in so many outrageous ways<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and with all
but impunity, that a course repeatedly urged by Talfourd
and myself was at last taken in the present year
with the <i>Christmas Carol</i> and the <i>Chuzzlewit</i> pirates.
Upon a case of such peculiar flagrancy, however, that
the vice-chancellor would not even hear Dickens's
counsel; and what it cost our dear friend Talfourd to
suppress his speech exceeded by very much the labour
and pains with which he had prepared it. "The
pirates," wrote Dickens to me, after leaving the court
on the 18th of January, "are beaten flat. They are
bruised, bloody, battered, smashed, squelched, and
utterly undone. Knight Bruce would not hear Talfourd,
but instantly gave judgment. He had interrupted
Anderdon constantly by asking him to produce
a passage which was not an expanded or contracted
idea from my book. And at every successive passage
he cried out, 'That is Mr. Dickens's case. Find
another!' He said that there was not a shadow of
doubt upon the matter. That there was no authority
which would bear a construction in their favour; the
piracy going beyond all previous instances. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_98" id="Page_2_98">[98]</a></span>
might mention it again in a week, he said, if they
liked, and might have an issue if they pleased; but
they would probably consider it unnecessary after that
strong expression of his opinion. Of course I will
stand by what we have agreed as to the only terms of
compromise with the printers. I am determined that
I will have an apology for their affidavits. The other
men may pay their costs and get out of it, but I will
stick to my friend the author." Two days later he
wrote: "The farther affidavits put in by way of extenuation
by the printing rascals <i>are</i> rather strong,
and give one a pretty correct idea of what the men
must be who hold on by the heels of literature. Oh!
the agony of Talfourd at Knight Bruce's not hearing
him! He had sat up till three in the morning, he
says, preparing his speech; and would have done all
kinds of things with the affidavits. It certainly was a
splendid subject. We have heard nothing from the vagabonds
yet. I once thought of printing the affidavits
without a word of comment, and sewing them up with
<i>Chuzzlewit</i>. Talfourd is strongly disinclined to compromise
with the printers on any terms. In which case
it would be referred to the master to ascertain what
profits had been made by the piracy, and to order the
same to be paid to me. But wear and tear of law is
my consideration." The undertaking to which he
had at last to submit was, that upon ample public
apology, and payment of all costs, the offenders should
be let go; but the real result was that, after infinite
vexation and trouble, he had himself to pay all the
costs incurred on his own behalf; and, a couple of
years later, upon repetition of the wrong he had suffered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_99" id="Page_2_99">[99]</a></span>
in so gross a form that proceedings were again
advised by Talfourd and others, he wrote to me from
Switzerland the condition of mind to which his experience
had brought him. "My feeling about the &mdash;&mdash; is
the feeling common, I suppose, to three fourths of
the reflecting part of the community in our happiest
of all possible countries; and that is, that it is better
to suffer a great wrong than to have recourse to the
much greater wrong of the law. I shall not easily forget
the expense, and anxiety, and horrible injustice of
the <i>Carol</i> case, wherein, in asserting the plainest right
on earth, I was really treated as if I were the robber
instead of the robbed. Upon the whole, I certainly
would much rather <span class="smcap">not</span> proceed. What do you think
of sending in a grave protest against what has been done
in this case, on account of the immense amount of piracy
to which I am daily exposed, and because I have been
already met in the court of chancery with the legal
doctrine that silence under such wrongs barred my
remedy: to which Talfourd's written opinion might
be appended as proof that we stopped under no discouragement.
It is useless to affect that I don't know
I have a morbid susceptibility of exasperation, to which
the meanness and badness of the law in such a matter
would be stinging in the last degree. And I know of
nothing that <i>could</i> come, even of a successful action,
which would be worth the mental trouble and disturbance
it would cost."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_100" id="Page_2_100">[100]</a></span></p><p>A few notes of besetting temptations during his
busiest days at <i>Chuzzlewit</i>, one taken from each of the
first four months of the year when he was working at
its masterly closing scenes, will amusingly exhibit, side
by side, his powers of resistance and capacities of enjoyment.
"I had written you a line" (16th of January),
"pleading Jonas and Mrs. Gamp, but this frosty
day tempts me sorely. I am distractingly late; but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_101" id="Page_2_101">[101]</a></span>
look at the sky, think of Hampstead, and feel hideously
tempted. Don't come with Mae, and fetch me. I
couldn't resist if you did." In the next (18th of February),
he is not the tempted, but the tempter. "Stanfield
and Mac have come in, and we are going to
Hampstead to dinner. I leave Betsey Prig as you
know, so don't you make a scruple about leaving Mrs.
Harris. We shall stroll leisurely up, to give you time
to join us, and dinner will be on the table at Jack
Straw's at four.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the very improbable (surely
impossible?) case of your not coming, we will call on
you at a quarter before eight, to go to the ragged
school." The next (5th of March) shows him in
yielding mood, and pitying himself for his infirmity of
compliance. "Sir, I will&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;I
will <span class="smcap">not</span> eat with you, either at your own house or
the club. But the morning looks bright, and a walk
to Hampstead would suit me marvellously. If you
should present yourself at my gate (bringing the R.
A.'s along with you) I shall not be sapparized. So no
more at this writing from Poor <span class="smcap">Mr. Dickens</span>." But
again the tables are turned, and he is tempter in the
last; written on that Shakespeare day (23rd of April)
which we kept always as a festival, and signed in
character expressive of his then present unfitness for
any of the practical affairs of life, including the very
pressing business which at the moment ought to have
occupied him, namely, attention to the long deferred
nuptials of Miss Charity Pecksniff. "November blasts!
Why it's the warmest, most genial, most intensely bland,
delicious, growing, springy, songster-of-the-grovy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_102" id="Page_2_102">[102]</a></span>
bursting-forth-of-the-buddy, day as ever was. At half-past
four I shall expect you. Ever, <span class="smcap">Moddle</span>."</p>

<p>Moddle, the sentimental noodle hooked by Miss
Pecksniff who flies on his proposed wedding-day from
the frightful prospect before him, the reader of course
knows; and has perhaps admired for his last supreme
outbreak of common sense. It was a rather favourite
bit of humour with Dickens; and I find it pleasant to
think that he never saw the description given of it by a
trained and skilful French critic, who has been able
to pass under his review the whole of English literature
without any apparent sense or understanding of one
of its most important as well as richest elements. A
man without the perception of humour taking English
prose literature in hand, can of course set about it only
in one way. Accordingly, in Mr. Taine's decisive
judgments of our last great humourist, which proceed
upon a principle of psychological analysis which it is
only fair to say he applies impartially to everybody,
<i>Pickwick</i>, <i>Oliver Twist</i>, and <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>
are not in any manner even named or alluded to; Mrs.
Gamp is only once mentioned as always talking of Mrs.
Harris; and Mr. Micawber also only once as using
always the same emphatic phrases; the largest extracts
are taken from the two books in all the Dickens series
that are weakest on the humorous side, <i>Hard Times</i> and
the <i>Chimes;</i> <i>Nickleby</i>, with its many laughter-moving
figures, is dismissed in a line and a half; Mr. Toots,
Captain Cuttle, Susan Nipper, Toodles, and the rest
have no place in what is said of <i>Dombey;</i> and, to close
with what has caused and must excuse my digression,
Mr. Augustus Moddle is introduced as a gloomy maniac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_103" id="Page_2_103">[103]</a></span>
who makes us laugh and makes us shudder, and as
drawn so truly for a madman that though at first sight
agreeable, he is in reality horrible!<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>A month before the letter subscribed by Dickens in
the character, so happily unknown to himself, of this
gloomy maniac, he had written to me from amidst his
famous chapter in which the tables are turned on Pecksniff;
but here I quote the letter chiefly for noticeable
words at its close. "I heard from Macready by the
Hibernia. I have been slaving away regularly, but the
weather is against rapid progress. I altered the verbal
error, and substituted for the action you didn't like
some words expressive of the hurry of the scene. Macready
sums up slavery in New Orleans in the way of a
gentle doubting on the subject, by a 'but' and a dash.
I believe it is in New Orleans that the man is lying
under sentence of death, who, not having the fear of
God before his eyes, did not deliver up a captive slave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_104" id="Page_2_104">[104]</a></span>
to the torture? The largest gun in that country has not
burst yet&mdash;<i>but it will</i>. Heaven help us, too, from explosions
nearer home! I declare I never go into what
is called 'society' that I am not aweary of it, despise it,
hate it, and reject it. The more I see of its extraordinary
conceit, and its stupendous ignorance of what is
passing out of doors, the more certain I am that it is
approaching the period when, being incapable of reforming
itself, it will have to submit to be reformed by
others off the face of the earth." Thus we see that the
old radical leanings were again rather strong in him at
present, and I may add that he had found occasional
recent vent for them by writing in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>Some articles thus contributed by him having set
people talking, the proprietors of the paper rather
eagerly mooted the question what payment he would
ask for contributing regularly; and ten guineas an
article was named. Very sensibly, however, the editor
who had succeeded his old friend Black pointed out to
him, that though even that sum would not be refused
in the heat of the successful articles just contributed,
yet (I quote his own account in a letter of the 7th of
March 1844) so much would hardly be paid continuously;
and thereupon an understanding, was come to,
that he would write as a volunteer and leave his payment
to be adjusted to the results. "Then said the
editor&mdash;and this I particularly want you to turn over
in your mind, at leisure&mdash;supposing me to go abroad,
could I contemplate such a thing as the writing of a
letter a week under any signature I chose, with such
scraps of descriptions and impressions as suggested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_105" id="Page_2_105">[105]</a></span>
themselves to my mind? If so, would I do it for the
<i>Chronicle?</i> And if so again, what would I do it for?
He thought for such contributions Easthope would
pay anything. I told him that the idea had never
occurred to me; but that I was afraid he did not know
what the value of such contributions would be. He
repeated what he had said before; and I promised to
consider whether I could reconcile it to myself to write
such letters at all. The pros and cons need to be very
carefully weighed. I will not tell you to which side I
incline, but if we should disagree, or waver on the same
points, we will call Bradbury and Evans to the council.
I think it more than probable that we shall be of exactly
the same mind, but I want you to be in possession of
the facts and therefore send you this rigmarole." The
rigmarole is not unimportant; because, though we did
not differ on the wisdom of saying No to the <i>Chronicle</i>,
the "council" spoken of was nevertheless held, and in
it lay the germ of another newspaper enterprise he permitted
himself to engage in twelve months later, to
which he would have done more wisely to have also
answered No.</p>

<p>The preparation for departure was now actively going
forward, and especially his enquiries for two important
adjuncts thereto, a courier and a carriage. As to the
latter it occurred to him that he might perhaps get for
little money "some good old shabby devil of a coach&mdash;one
of those vast phantoms that hide themselves in
a corner of the Pantechnicon;" and exactly such a one
he found there; sitting himself inside it, a perfect
Sentimental Traveller, while the managing man told
him its history. "As for comfort&mdash;let me see&mdash;it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_106" id="Page_2_106">[106]</a></span>
about the size of your library; with night-lamps and
day-lamps and pockets and imperials and leathern
cellars, and the most extraordinary contrivances.
Joking apart, it is a wonderful machine. And when
you see it (if you <i>do</i> see it) you will roar at it first, and
will then proclaim it to be 'perfectly brilliant, my dear
fellow.'" It was marked sixty pounds; he got it for
five-and-forty; and my own emotions respecting it he
had described by anticipation quite correctly. In finding
a courier he was even more fortunate; and these
successes were followed by a third apparently very
promising, but in the result less satisfactory. His
house was let to not very careful people.</p>

<p>The tenant having offered herself for Devonshire-terrace
unexpectedly, during the last week or two of
his stay in England he went into temporary quarters in
Osnaburgh-terrace; and here a domestic difficulty befell
of which the mention may be amusing, when I have
disposed of an incident that preceded it too characteristic
for omission. The Mendicity Society's officers had
caught a notorious begging-letter writer, had identified
him as an old offender against Dickens of which proofs
were found on his person, and had put matters in train
for his proper punishment; when the wretched creature's
wife made such appeal before the case was heard at the
police-court, that Dickens broke down in his character
of prosecutor, and at the last moment, finding what was
said of the man's distress at the time to be true, relented.
"When the Mendicity officers themselves told
me the man was in distress, I desired them to suppress
what they knew about him, and slipped out of the bundle
(in the police office) his first letter, which was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_107" id="Page_2_107">[107]</a></span>
greatest lie of all. For he looked wretched, and his
wife had been waiting about the street to see me, all
the morning. It was an exceedingly bad case however,
and the imposition, all through, very great indeed.
Insomuch that I could not <i>say</i> anything in his favour,
even when I saw him. Yet I was not sorry that the
creature found the loophole for escape. The officers
had taken him illegally without any warrant; and really
they messed it all through, quite facetiously."</p>

<p>He will himself also best relate the small domestic
difficulty into which he fell in his temporary dwelling,
upon his unexpectedly discovering it to be unequal to the
strain of a dinner party for which invitations had gone
out just before the sudden "let" of Devonshire-terrace.
The letter is characteristic in other ways, or I should
hardly have gone so far into domesticities here; and it
enables me to add that with the last on its list of guests,
Mr. Chapman the chairman of Lloyd's, he held much
friendly intercourse, and that few things more absurd
or unfounded have been invented, even of Dickens,
than that he found any part of the original of Mr.
Dombey in the nature, the appearance, or the manners
of this estimable gentleman. "Advise, advise," he
wrote (9 Osnaburgh-terrace, 28th of May 1844), "advise
with a distracted man. Investigation below stairs
renders it, as my father would say, 'manifest to any
person of ordinary intelligence, if the term may be considered
allowable,' that the Saturday's dinner cannot
come off here with safety. It would be a toss-up, and
might come down heads, but it would put us into an
agony with that kind of people.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now, I feel a difficulty
in dropping it altogether, and really fear that this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_108" id="Page_2_108">[108]</a></span>
might have an indefinably suspicious and odd appearance.
Then said I at breakfast this morning, I'll send
down to the Clarendon. Then says Kate, have it at
Richmond. Then I say, that might be inconvenient
to the people. Then she says, how could it be if we
dine late enough? Then I am very much offended
without exactly knowing why; and come up here, in a
state of hopeless mystification.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What do you think?
Ellis would be quite as dear as anybody else; and unless
the weather changes, the place is objectionable. I must
make up my mind to do one thing or other, for we shall
meet Lord Denman at dinner to-day. Could it be
dropped decently? That, I think very doubtful. Could
it be done for a couple of guineas apiece at the Clarendon?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
In a matter of more importance I could make
up my mind. But in a matter of this kind I bother and
bewilder myself, and come to no conclusion whatever.
Advise! Advise!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. List of the Invited. There's Lord
Normanby. And there's Lord Denman. There's Easthope,
wife, and sister. There's Sydney Smith. There's
you and Mac. There's Babbage. There's a Lady Osborne
and her daughter. There's Southwood Smith.
And there's Quin. And there are Thomas Chapman
and his wife. So many of these people have never
dined with us, that the fix is particularly tight. Advise!
Advise!" My advice was for throwing over the party
altogether, but additional help was obtained and the
dinner went off very pleasantly. It was the last time
we saw Sydney Smith.</p>

<p>Of one other characteristic occurrence he wrote
before he left; and the very legible epigraph round
the seal of his letter, "It is particularly requested that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_109" id="Page_2_109">[109]</a></span>
if Sir James Graham should open this, he will not
trouble himself to seal it again," expresses both its
date and its writer's opinion of a notorious transaction
of the time. "I wish" (28th of June) "you would
read this, and give it me again when we meet at Stanfield's
to-day. Newby has written to me to say that
he hopes to be able to give Overs more money than
was agreed on." The enclosure was the proof-sheet
of a preface written by him to a small collection of
stories by a poor carpenter dying of consumption,
who hoped by their publication, under protection of
such a name, to leave behind him some small provision
for his ailing wife and little children.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The book
was dedicated to the kind physician, Doctor Elliotson,
whose name was for nearly thirty years a synonym with
us all for unwearied, self-sacrificing, beneficent service
to every one in need.</p>

<p>The last incident before Dickens's departure was a
farewell dinner to him at Greenwich, which took also
the form of a celebration for the completion of <i>Chuzzlewit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_110" id="Page_2_110">[110]</a></span></i>,
or, as the Ballantynes used to call it in Scott's
case, a christening dinner; when Lord Normanby
took the chair, and I remember sitting next the great
painter Turner, who had come with Stanfield, and had
enveloped his throat, that sultry summer day, in a
huge red belcher-handkerchief which nothing would
induce him to remove. He was not otherwise demonstrative,
but enjoyed himself in a quiet silent way, less
perhaps at the speeches than at the changing lights on
the river. Carlyle did not come; telling me in his
reply to the invitation that he truly loved Dickens,
having discerned in the inner man of him a real music
of the genuine kind, but that he'd rather testify to
this in some other form than that of dining out in the
dogdays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> travelling party arrived at Marseilles on the
evening of Sunday the 14th of July. Not being able
to get vetturino horses in Paris, they had come on, post;
paying for nine horses but bringing only four, and
thereby saving a shilling a mile out of what the four
would have cost in England. So great thus far, however,
had been the cost of travel, that "what with
distance, caravan, sight-seeing, and everything," two
hundred pounds would be nearly swallowed up before
they were at their destination. The success otherwise
had been complete. The children had not cried in
their worst troubles, the carriage had gone lightly over
abominable roads, and the courier had proved himself
a perfect gem. "Surrounded by strange and perfectly
novel circumstances," Dickens wrote to me from Marseilles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_112" id="Page_2_112">[112]</a></span>
"I feel as if I had a new head on side by side
with my old one."</p>

<p>To what shrewd and kindly observation the old one
had helped him at every stage of his journey, his published
book of travel tells, and of all that there will be
nothing here; but a couple of experiences at his outset,
of which he told me afterwards, have enough character
in them to be worth mention.</p>

<p>Shortly before there had been some public interest
about the captain of a Boulogne steamer apprehended
on a suspicion of having stolen specie, but reinstated
by his owners after a public apology to him on their
behalf; and Dickens had hardly set foot on the boat
that was to carry them across, when he was attracted
by the look of its captain, and discovered him after a
few minutes' talk to be that very man. "Such an honest,
simple, good fellow, I never saw," said Dickens,
as he imitated for me the homely speech in which his
confidences were related. The Boulogne people, he
said, had given him a piece of plate, "but Lord bless
us! it took a deal more than that to get him round
again in his own mind; and for weeks and weeks he was
uncommon low to be sure. Newgate, you see! What a
place for a sea-faring man as had held up his head afore
the best on 'em, and had more friends, I mean to say,
and I do tell you the daylight truth, than any man on
this station&mdash;ah! or any other, I don't care where!"</p>

<p>His first experience in a foreign tongue he made immediately
on landing, when he had gone to the bank
for money, and after delivering with most laborious
distinctness a rather long address in French to the clerk
behind the counter, was disconcerted by that functionary's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_113" id="Page_2_113">[113]</a></span>
cool enquiry in the native-born Lombard-street
manner, "How would you like to take it, sir?" He
took it, as everybody must, in five-franc pieces, and a
most inconvenient coinage he found it; for he required
so much that he had to carry it in a couple of small
sacks, and was always "turning hot about suddenly"
taking it into his head that he had lost them.</p>

<p>The evening of Tuesday the 16th of July saw him in
a villa at Albaro, the suburb of Genoa in which, upon
the advice of our Gore-house friends, he had resolved
to pass the summer months before taking up his quarters
in the city. His wish was to have had Lord
Byron's house there, but it had fallen into neglect and
become the refuge of a third-rate wine-shop. The
matter had then been left to Angus Fletcher who just
now lived near Genoa, and he had taken at a rent
absurdly above its value<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> an unpicturesque and uninteresting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_114" id="Page_2_114">[114]</a></span>
dwelling, which at once impressed its new
tenant with its likeness to a pink jail. "It is," he said
to me, "the most perfectly lonely, rusty, stagnant old
staggerer of a domain that you can possibly imagine.
What would I give if you could only look round the
courtyard! <i>I</i> look down into it, whenever I am near
that side of the house, for the stable is so full of 'vermin
and swarmers' (pardon the quotation from my inimitable
friend) that I always expect to see the carriage
going out bodily, with legions of industrious fleas harnessed
to and drawing it off, on their own account.
We have a couple of Italian work-people in our establishment;
and to hear one or other of them talking
away to our servants with the utmost violence and volubility
in Genoese, and our servants answering with
great fluency in English (very loud: as if the others
were only deaf, not Italian), is one of the most ridiculous
things possible. The effect is greatly enhanced
by the Genoese manner, which is exceedingly animated
and pantomimic; so that two friends of the lower class
conversing pleasantly in the street, always seem on the
eve of stabbing each other forthwith. And a stranger
is immensely astonished at their not doing it."</p>

<p>The heat tried him less than he expected, excepting
always the sirocco, which, near the sea as they were,
and right in the course of the wind as it blew against
the house, made everything hotter than if there had
been no wind. "One feels it most, on first getting up.
Then, it is really so oppressive that a strong determination
is necessary to enable one to go on dressing; one's
tendency being to tumble down anywhere and lie
there." It seemed to hit him, he said, behind the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_115" id="Page_2_115">[115]</a></span>
knee, and made his legs so shake that he could not
walk or stand. He had unfortunately a whole week of
this without intermission, soon after his arrival; but
then came a storm, with wind from the mountains;
and he could bear the ordinary heat very well. What
at first had been a home-discomfort, the bare walls,
lofty ceilings, icy floors, and lattice blinds, soon became
agreeable; there were regular afternoon breezes
from the sea; in his courtyard was a well of very pure
and very cold water; there were new milk and eggs by
the bucketful, and, to protect from the summer insects
these and other dainties, there were fresh vine-leaves
by the thousand; and he satisfied himself, by the
experience of a day or two in the city, that he had
done well to come first to its suburb by the sea. What
startled and disappointed him most were the frequent
cloudy days.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> He opened his third letter (3rd of August)
by telling me there was a thick November fog,
that rain was pouring incessantly, and that he did not
remember to have seen in his life, at that time of year,
such cloudy weather as he had seen beneath Italian
skies.</p>

<p>"The story goes that it is in autumn and winter,
when other countries are dark and foggy, that the
beauty and clearness of this are most observable. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_116" id="Page_2_116">[116]</a></span>
hope it may prove so; for I have postponed going
round the hills which encircle the city, or seeing any
of the sights, until the weather is more favourable.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> I
have never yet seen it so clear, for any longer time of
the day together, as on a bright, lark-singing, coast-of-France-discerning
day at Broadstairs; nor have I ever
seen so fine a sunset, <i>throughout</i>, as is very common
there. But the scenery is exquisite, and at certain
periods of the evening and the morning the blue of the
Mediterranean surpasses all conception or description.
It is the most intense and wonderful colour, I do believe,
in all nature."</p>

<p>In his second letter from Albaro there was more of
this subject; and an outbreak of whimsical enthusiasm
in it, meant especially for Maclise, is followed by some
capital description. "I address you, my friend," he
wrote, "with something of the lofty spirit of an exile,
a banished commoner, a sort of Anglo-Pole. I don't
exactly know what I have done for my country in coming
away from it, but I feel it is something; something
great; something virtuous and heroic. Lofty emotions
rise within me, when I see the sun set on the blue Mediterranean.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_117" id="Page_2_117">[117]</a></span>
I am the limpet on the rock. My father's
name is Turner, and my boots are green.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Apropos
of blue. In a certain picture called the Serenade for
which Browning wrote that verse<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> in Lincoln's-inn-fields,
you, O Mac, painted a sky. If you ever have
occasion to paint the Mediterranean, let it be exactly
of that colour. It lies before me now, as deeply
and intensely blue. But no such colour is above me.
Nothing like it. In the south of France, at Avignon,
at Aix, at Marseilles, I saw deep blue skies; and
also in America. But the sky above me is familiar to
my sight. Is it heresy to say that I have seen its
twin brother shining through the window of Jack
Straw's&mdash;that down in Devonshire-terrace I have seen
a better sky? I dare say it is; but like a great many
other heresies, it is true.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But such green, green,
green, as flutters in the vineyard down below the windows,
<i>that</i> I never saw; nor yet such lilac and such purple
as float between me and the distant hills; nor yet
in anything, picture, book, or vestal boredom, such
awful, solemn, impenetrable blue, as in that same sea.
It has such an absorbing, silent, deep, profound effect,
that I can't help thinking it suggested the idea of Styx.
It looks as if a draught of it, only so much as you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_118" id="Page_2_118">[118]</a></span>
could scoop up on the beach in the hollow of your
hand, would wash out everything else, and make a
great blue blank of your intellect.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When the sun
sets clearly, then, by Heaven, it is majestic. From
any one of eleven windows here, or from a terrace
overgrown with grapes, you may behold the broad sea,
villas, houses, mountains, forts, strewn with rose leaves.
Strewn with them? Steeped in them! Dyed, through
and through and through. For a moment. No more.
The sun is impatient and fierce (like everything else in
these parts), and goes down headlong. Run to fetch
your hat&mdash;and it's night. Wink at the right time of
black night&mdash;and it's morning. Everything is in extremes.
There is an insect here that chirps all day.
There is one outside the window now. The chirp is
very loud: something like a Brobdingnagian grasshopper.
The creature is born to chirp; to progress in
chirping; to chirp louder, louder, louder; till it gives
one tremendous chirp and bursts itself. That is its life
and death. Everything is 'in a concatenation accordingly.'
The day gets brighter, brighter, brighter, till
it's night. The summer gets hotter, hotter, hotter, till
it explodes. The fruit gets riper, riper, riper, till it
tumbles down and rots.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ask me a question or two
about fresco: will you be so good? All the houses are
painted in fresco, hereabout (the outside walls I mean,
the fronts, backs, and sides), and all the colour has run
into damp and green seediness; and the very design
has straggled away into the component atoms of the
plaster. Beware of fresco! Sometimes (but not often)
I can make out a Virgin with a mildewed glory round
her head, holding nothing in an undiscernible lap with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_119" id="Page_2_119">[119]</a></span>
invisible arms; and occasionally the leg or arm of a
cherub. But it is very melancholy and dim. There are
two old fresco-painted vases outside my own gate, one
on either hand, which are so faint that I never saw
them till last night; and only then, because I was looking
over the wall after a lizard who had come upon
me while I was smoking a cigar above, and crawled
over one of these embellishments in his retreat.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>That letter sketched for me the story of his travel
through France, and I may at once say that I thus received,
from week to week, the "first sprightly runnings"
of every description in his <i>Pictures from Italy</i>. But my
rule as to the American letters must be here observed
yet more strictly; and nothing resembling his printed
book, however distantly, can be admitted into these
pages. Even so my difficulty of rejection will not be
less; for as he had not actually decided, until the very
last, to publish his present experiences at all, a larger
number of the letters were left unrifled by him. He
had no settled plan from the first, as in the other case.</p>

<p>His most valued acquaintance at Albaro was the
French consul-general, a student of our literature who
had written on his books in one of the French reviews,
and who with his English wife lived in the very next
villa, though so oddly shut away by its vineyard that
to get from the one adjoining house to the other was a
mile's journey.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Describing, in that August letter, his
first call from this new friend thus pleasantly self-recommended,
he makes the visit his excuse for breaking off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_120" id="Page_2_120">[120]</a></span>
from a facetious description of French inns to introduce
to me a sketch, from a pencil outline by Fletcher,
of what bore the imposing name of the Villa di Bella
vista, but which he called by the homelier one of its proprietor,
Bagnerello. "This, my friend, is quite accurate.
Allow me to explain it. You are standing, sir,
in our vineyard, among the grapes and figs. The Mediterranean
is at your back as you look at the house: of
which two sides, out of four, are here depicted. The
lower story (nearly concealed by the vines) consists of
the hall, a wine-cellar, and some store-rooms. The
three windows on the left of the first floor belong to the
sala, lofty and whitewashed, which has two more windows
round the corner. The fourth window <i>did</i> belong
to the dining-room, but I have changed one of the
nurseries for better air; and it now appertains to that
branch of the establishment. The fifth and sixth, or
two right-hand windows, sir, admit the light to the
inimitable's (and uxor's) chamber; to which the first
window round the right-hand corner, which you perceive
in shadow, also belongs. The next window in
shadow, young sir, is the bower of Miss H. The next,
a nursery window; the same having two more round
the corner again. The bowery-looking place stretching
out upon the left of the house is the terrace, which
opens out from a French window in the drawing-room
on the same floor, of which you see nothing: and
forms one side of the court-yard. The upper windows
belong to some of those uncounted chambers upstairs;
the fourth one, longer than the rest, being in F.'s bedroom.
There is a kitchen or two up there besides, and
my dressing-room; which you can't see from this point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_121" id="Page_2_121">[121]</a></span>
of view. The kitchens and other offices in use are down
below, under that part of the house where the roof is
longest. On your left, beyond the bay of Genoa, about
two miles off, the Alps stretch off into the far horizon;
on your right, at three or four miles distance, are mountains
crowned with forts. The intervening space on
both sides is dotted with villas, some green, some red,
some yellow, some blue, some (and ours among the
number) pink. At your back, as I have said, sir, is
the ocean; with the slim Italian tower of the ruined
church of St. John the Baptist rising up before it, on
the top of a pile of savage rocks. You go through the
court-yard, and out at the gate, and down a narrow
lane to the sea. Note. The sala goes sheer up to the
top of the house; the ceiling being conical, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_122" id="Page_2_122">[122]</a></span>
little bedrooms built round the spring of its arch. You
will observe that we make no pretension to architectural
magnificence, but that we have abundance of room.
And here I am, beholding only vines and the sea for
days together.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Good Heavens! How I wish you'd
come for a week or two, and taste the white wine at a
penny farthing the pint. It is excellent."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then,
after seven days: "I have got my paper and inkstand
and figures now (the box from Osnaburgh-terrace only
came last Thursday), and can think&mdash;I have begun to
do so every morning&mdash;with a business-like air, of the
Christmas book. My paper is arranged, and my pens
are spread out in the usual form. I think you know the
form&mdash;Don't you? My books have not passed the
custom-house yet, and I tremble for some volumes of
Voltaire.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I write in the best bedroom. The sun is
off the corner window at the side of the house by a very
little after twelve; and I can then throw the blinds
open, and look up from my paper, at the sea, the mountains,
the washed-out villas, the vineyards, at the blistering
white hot fort with a sentry on the drawbridge
standing in a bit of shadow no broader than his own
musket, and at the sky, as often as I like. It is a very
peaceful view, and yet a very cheerful one. Quiet as
quiet can be."</p>

<p>Not yet however had the time for writing come. A
sharp attack of illness befell his youngest little daughter,
Kate, and troubled him much. Then, after beginning
the Italian grammar himself, he had to call in the help
of a master; and this learning of the language took up
time. But he had an aptitude for it, and after a month's
application told me (24th of August) that he could ask<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_123" id="Page_2_123">[123]</a></span>
in Italian for whatever he wanted in any shop or coffee-house,
and could read it pretty well. "I wish you
could see me" (16th of September), "without my
knowing it, walking about alone here. I am now as
bold as a lion in the streets. The audacity with which
one begins to speak when there is no help for it, is
quite astonishing." The blank impossibility at the
outset, however, of getting native meanings conveyed
to his English servants, he very humorously described
to me; and said the spell was first broken by the cook,
"being really a clever woman, and not entrenching
herself in that astonishing pride of ignorance which
induces the rest to oppose themselves to the receipt of
any information through any channel, and which made
A. careless of looking out of window, in America, even
to see the Falls of Niagara." So that he soon had to
report the gain, to all of them, from the fact of this
enterprising woman having so primed herself with "the
names of all sorts of vegetables, meats, soups, fruits, and
kitchen necessaries," that she was able to order whatever
was needful of the peasantry that were trotting in
and out all day, basketed and barefooted. Her example
became at once contagious;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and before the end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_124" id="Page_2_124">[124]</a></span>
of the second week of September news reached me that
"the servants are beginning to pick up scraps of Italian;
some of them go to a weekly conversazione of servants
at the Governor's every Sunday night, having got over
their consternation at the frequent introduction of
quadrilles on these occasions; and I think they begin
to like their foreigneering life."</p>

<p>In the tradespeople they dealt with at Albaro he
found amusing points of character. Sharp as they
were after money, their idleness quenched even that
propensity. Order for immediate delivery two or three
pounds of tea, and the tea-dealer would be wretched.
"Won't it do to-morrow?" "I want it now," you
would reply; and he would say, "No, no, there can
be no hurry!" He remonstrated against the cruelty.
But everywhere there was deference, courtesy, more
than civility. "In a caf&eacute; a little tumbler of ice costs
something less than threepence, and if you give the
waiter in addition what you would not offer to an
English beggar, say, the third of a halfpenny, he is
profoundly grateful." The attentions received from
English residents were unremitting.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In moments of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_125" id="Page_2_125">[125]</a></span>
need at the outset, they bestirred themselves ("large
merchants and grave men") as if they were the family's
salaried purveyors; and there was in especial one
gentleman named Curry whose untiring kindness was
long remembered.</p>

<p>The light, eager, active figure soon made itself
familiar in the streets of Genoa, and he never went
into them without bringing some oddity away. I soon
heard of the strada Nuova and strada Balbi; of the
broadest of the two as narrower than Albany-street,
and of the other as less wide than Drury-lane or Wych-street;
but both filled with palaces of noble architecture
and of such vast dimensions that as many windows
as there are days in the year might be counted in one
of them, and this not covering by any means the
largest plot of ground. I heard too of the other
streets, none with footways, and all varying in degrees
of narrowness, but for the most part like Field-lane in
Holborn, with little breathing-places like St. Martin's-court;
and the widest only in parts wide enough to
enable a carriage and pair to turn. "Imagine yourself
looking down a street of Reform Clubs cramped
after this odd fashion, the lofty roofs almost seeming
to meet in the perspective." In the churches nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_126" id="Page_2_126">[126]</a></span>
struck him so much as the profusion of trash and tinsel
in them that contrasted with their real splendours of
embellishment. One only, that of the Cappucini friars,
blazed every inch of it with gold, precious stones, and
paintings of priceless art; the principal contrast to its
radiance being the dirt of its masters, whose bare legs,
corded waists, and coarse brown serge never changed
by night or day, proclaimed amid their corporate
wealth their personal vows of poverty. He found
them less pleasant to meet and look at than the country
people of their suburb on festa-days, with the Indulgences
that gave them the right to make merry
stuck in their hats like turnpike-tickets. He did not
think the peasant girls in general good-looking, though
they carried themselves daintily and walked remarkably
well: but the ugliness of the old women, begotten
of hard work and a burning sun, with porters' knots
of coarse grey hair grubbed up over wrinkled and
cadaverous faces, he thought quite stupendous. He
was never in a street a hundred yards long without
getting up perfectly the witch part of <i>Macbeth</i>.</p>

<p>With the theatres of course he soon became acquainted,
and of that of the puppets he wrote to me
again and again with humorous rapture. "There are
other things," he added, after giving me the account
which is published in his book, "too solemnly surprising
to dwell upon. They must be seen. They must
be seen. The enchanter carrying off the bride is not
greater than his men brandishing fiery torches and
dropping their lighted spirits of wine at every shake.
Also the enchanter himself, when, hunted down and
overcome, he leaps into the rolling sea, and finds a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_127" id="Page_2_127">[127]</a></span>
watery grave. Also the second comic man, aged about
55 and like George the Third in the face, when he
gives out the play for the next night. They must all
be seen. They can't be told about. Quite impossible."
The living performers he did not think so good,
a disbelief in Italian actors having been always a heresy
with him, and the deplorable length of dialogue to the
small amount of action in their plays making them sadly
tiresome. The first that he saw at the principal theatre
was a version of Balzac's <i>P&egrave;re Goriot</i>. "The domestic
Lear I thought at first was going to be very clever. But
he was too pitiful&mdash;perhaps the Italian reality would
be. He was immensely applauded, though." He afterwards
saw a version of Dumas' preposterous play of
<i>Kean</i>, in which most of the representatives of English
actors wore red hats with steeple crowns, and very loose
blouses with broad belts and buckles round their waists.
"There was a mysterious person called the Prince of
Var-lees" (Wales), "the youngest and slimmest man in
the company, whose badinage in Kean's dressing-room
was irresistible; and the dresser wore top-boots, a Greek
skull-cap, a black velvet jacket, and leather breeches.
One or two of the actors looked very hard at me to see
how I was touched by these English peculiarities&mdash;especially
when Kean kissed his male friends on both
cheeks." The arrangements of the house, which he
described as larger than Drury-lane, he thought excellent.
Instead of a ticket for the private box he had
taken on the first tier, he received the usual key for
admission which let him in as if he lived there; and for
the whole set-out, "quite as comfortable and private as
a box at our opera," paid only eight and fourpence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_128" id="Page_2_128">[128]</a></span>
English. The opera itself had not its regular performers
until after Christmas, but in the summer there was a
good comic company, and he saw the <i>Scaramuccia</i>
and the <i>Barber of Seville</i> brightly and pleasantly done.
There was also a day theatre, beginning at half past
four in the afternoon; but beyond the novelty of looking
on at the covered stage as he sat in the fresh pleasant
air, he did not find much amusement in the Goldoni
comedy put before him. There came later a Russian
circus, which the unusual rains of that summer prematurely
extinguished.</p>

<p>The Religious Houses he made early and many enquiries
about, and there was one that had stirred and
baffled his curiosity much before he discovered what it
really was. All that was visible from the street was a
great high wall, apparently quite alone, no thicker than
a party wall, with grated windows, to which iron screens
gave farther protection. At first he supposed there had
been a fire; but by degrees came to know that on the
other side were galleries, one above another, one above
another, and nuns always pacing them to and fro. Like
the wall of a racket-ground outside, it was inside a very
large nunnery; and let the poor sisters walk never so
much, neither they nor the passers-by could see anything
of each other. It was close upon the Acqua
Sola, too; a little park with still young but very pretty
trees, and fresh and cheerful fountains, which the
Genoese made their Sunday promenade; and underneath
which was an archway with great public tanks,
where, at all ordinary times, washerwomen were washing
away, thirty or forty together. At Albaro they
were worse off in this matter: the clothes there being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_129" id="Page_2_129">[129]</a></span>
washed in a pond, beaten with gourds, and whitened
with a preparation of lime: "so that," he wrote to me
(24th of August), "what between the beating and the
burning they fall into holes unexpectedly, and my
white trowsers, after six weeks' washing, would make
very good fishing-nets. It is such a serious damage
that when we get into the Peschiere we mean to wash
at home."</p>

<p>Exactly a fortnight before this date, he had hired
rooms in the Peschiere from the first of the following
October; and so ended the house-hunting for his
winter residence, that had taken him so often to the
city. The Peschiere was the largest palace in Genoa
let on hire, and had the advantage of standing on a
height aloof from the town, surrounded by its own
gardens. The rooms taken had been occupied by an
English colonel, the remainder of whose term was let
to Dickens for 500 francs a month (&pound;20); and a few
days after (20th of August) he described to me a fellow
tenant: "A Spanish duke has taken the room under
me in the Peschiere. The duchess was his mistress
many years, and bore him (I think) six daughters. He
always promised her that if she gave birth to a son, he
would marry her; and when at last the boy arrived, he
went into her bedroom, saying&mdash;'Duchess, I am
charmed to "salute you!"' And he married her in good
earnest, and legitimatized (as by the Spanish law he
could) all the other children." The beauty of the new
abode will justify a little description when he takes up his
quarters there. One or two incidents may be related,
meanwhile, of the closing weeks of his residence at
Albaro.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_130" id="Page_2_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>In the middle of August he dined with the French
consul-general, and there will now be no impropriety
in printing his agreeable sketch of the dinner. "There
was present, among other Genoese, the Marquis di
Negri: a very fat and much older Jerdan, with the
same thickness of speech and size of tongue. He was
Byron's friend, keeps open house here, writes poetry,
improvises, and is a very good old Blunderbore; just
the sort of instrument to make an artesian well with,
anywhere. Well, sir, after dinner, the consul proposed
my health, with a little French conceit to the effect
that I had come to Italy to have personal experience
of its lovely climate, and that there was this similarity
between the Italian sun and its visitor, that the sun
shone into the darkest places and made them bright
and happy with its benignant influence, and that my
books had done the like with the breasts of men, and
so forth. Upon which Blunderbore gives his bright-buttoned
blue coat a great rap on the breast, turns up
his fishy eye, stretches out his arm like the living statue
defying the lightning at Astley's, and delivers four impromptu
verses in my honour, at which everybody is
enchanted, and I more than anybody&mdash;perhaps with
the best reason, for I didn't understand a word of them.
The consul then takes from his breast a roll of paper,
and says, 'I shall read them!' Blunderbore then says,
'Don't!' But the consul does, and Blunderbore beats
time to the music of the verse with his knuckles on the
table; and perpetually ducks forward to look round
the cap of a lady sitting between himself and me, to

The verses are in French&mdash;short line&mdash;on the taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_131" id="Page_2_131">[131]</a></span>
of Tangiers by the Prince de Joinville; and are received
with great applause; especially by a nobleman
present who is reported to be unable to read and write.
They end in my mind (rapidly translating them into
prose) thus,&mdash;</p>

'The cannon of France         Rendering thanks<br />

</div>

<p>If you can figure to yourself the choice absurdity of
receiving anything into one's mind in this way, you
can imagine the labour I underwent in my attempts to
keep the lower part of my face square, and to lift up
one eye gently, as with admiring attention. But I am
bound to add that this is really pretty literal; for I
read them afterwards."</p>

<p>This, too, was the year of other uncomfortable glories
of France in the last three years of her Orleans
dynasty; among them the Tahiti business, as politicians
may remember; and so hot became rumours of war
with England at the opening of September that Dickens
had serious thoughts of at once striking his tent. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_132" id="Page_2_132">[132]</a></span>
of his letters was filled with the conflicting doubts in
which they lived for nigh a fortnight, every day's arrival
contradicting the arrival of the day before: so that,
as he told me, you met a man in the street to-day, who
told you there would certainly be war in a week; and
you met the same man in the street to-morrow, and he
swore he always knew there would be nothing but
peace; and you met him again the day after, and he
said it all depended <i>now</i> on something perfectly new
and unheard of before, which somebody else said had
just come to the knowledge of some consul in some
dispatch which said something about some telegraph
which had been at work somewhere, signalizing some
prodigious intelligence. However, it all passed harmlessly
away, leaving him undisturbed opportunity to
avail himself of a pleasure that arose out of the consul-general's
dinner party, and to be present at a great
reception given shortly after by the good "old Blunderbore"
just mentioned, on the occasion of his daughter's
birthday.</p>

<p>The Marquis had a splendid house, but Dickens
found the grounds so carved into grottoes and fanciful
walks as to remind him of nothing so much as our old
White-conduit-house, except that he would have been
well pleased, on the present occasion, to have discovered
a waiter crying, "Give your orders, gents!" it
being not easy to him at any time to keep up, the whole
night through, on ices and variegated lamps merely.
But the scene for awhile was amusing enough, and not
rendered less so by the delight of the Marquis himself,
"who was constantly diving out into dark corners
and then among the lattice-work and flower pots,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_133" id="Page_2_133">[133]</a></span>
rubbing his hands and going round and round with
explosive chuckles in his huge satisfaction with the
entertainment." With horror it occurred to Dickens,
however, that four more hours of this kind of entertainment
would be too much; that the Genoa gates
closed at twelve; and that as the carriage had not
been ordered till the dancing was expected to be over
and the gates to reopen, he must make a sudden bolt
if he would himself get back to Albaro. "I had barely
time," he told me, "to reach the gate before midnight;
and was running as hard as I could go, down-hill,
over uneven ground, along a new street called the
strada Sevra, when I came to a pole fastened straight
across the street, nearly breast high, without any light
or watchman&mdash;quite in the Italian style. I went over
it, headlong, with such force that I rolled myself completely
white in the dust; but although I tore my
clothes to shreds, I hardly scratched myself except in
one place on the knee. I had no time to think of it
then, for I was up directly and off again to save the
gate: but when I got outside the wall, and saw the
state I was in, I wondered I had not broken my neck.
I 'took it easy' after this, and walked home, by lonely
ways enough, without meeting a single soul. But there
is nothing to be feared, I believe, from midnight walks
in this part of Italy. In other places you incur the
danger of being stabbed by mistake; whereas the
people here are quiet and good tempered, and very
rarely commit any outrage."</p>

<p>Such adventures, nevertheless, are seldom without
consequences, and there followed in this case a short
but sharp attack of illness. It came on with the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_134" id="Page_2_134">[134]</a></span>
"unspeakable and agonizing pain in the side," for
which Bob Fagin had prepared and applied the hot
bottles in the old warehouse time; and it yielded
quickly to powerful remedies. But for a few days he
had to content himself with the minor sights of Albaro.
He sat daily in the shade of the ruined chapel on the
seashore. He looked in at the festa in the small country
church, consisting mainly of a tenor singer, a seraphine,
and four priests sitting gaping in a row on one side of
the altar "in flowered satin dresses and little cloth
caps, looking exactly like the band at a wild-beast-caravan."
He was interested in the wine-making, and
in seeing the country tenants preparing their annual
presents for their landlords, of baskets of grapes and
other fruit prettily dressed with flowers. The season
of the grapes, too, brought out after dusk strong parties
of rats to eat them as they ripened, and so many shooting
parties of peasants to get rid of these despoilers,
that as he first listened to the uproar of the firing and
the echoes he half fancied it a siege of Albaro. The
flies mustered strong, too, and the mosquitos;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> so that
at night he had to lie covered up with gauze, like cold
meat in a safe.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_135" id="Page_2_135">[135]</a></span></p>
<p>Of course all news from England, and especially
visits paid him by English friends who might be travelling
in Italy, were a great delight. This was the year
when O'Connell was released from prison by the judgment
of the Lords on appeal. "I have no faith in
O'Connell taking the great position he might upon this:
being beleaguered by vanity always. Denman delights
me. I am glad to think I have always liked him so
well. I am sure that whenever he makes a mistake, it
<i>is</i> a mistake; and that no man lives who has a grander
and nobler scorn of every mean and dastard action. I
would to Heaven it were decorous to pay him some
public tribute of respect .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O'Connell's speeches
are the old thing: fretty, boastful, frothy, waspish at
the voices in the crowd, and all that: but with no true
greatness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What a relief to turn to that noble
letter of Carlyle's" (in which a timely testimony had
been borne to the truthfulness and honour of Mazzini),
"which I think above all praise. My love to him."
Among his English visitors were Mr. Tagart's family,
on their way from a scientific congress at Milan; and
Peter (now become Lord) Robertson from Rome, of
whose talk he wrote very pleasantly. The sons of Burns
had been entertained during the summer in Edinburgh
at what was called a Burns Festival, of which, through
Jerrold who was present, I had sent him no very favourable
account; and this was now confirmed by Robertson,
whose letters had given him an "awful" narrative
of Wilson's speech, and of the whole business. "There
was one man who spoke a quarter of an hour or so, to
the toast of the navy; and could say nothing more
than 'the&mdash;British&mdash;navy&mdash;always appreciates&mdash;' which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_136" id="Page_2_136">[136]</a></span>
remarkable sentiment he repeated over and over again
for that space of time; and then sat down. Robertson
told me also that Wilson's allusion to, or I should
rather say expatiation upon, the 'vices' of Burns, excited
but one sentiment of indignation and disgust:
and added, very sensibly, 'By God!&mdash;I want to know
<i>what Burns did!</i> I never heard of his doing anything
that need be strange or unaccountable to the Professor's
mind. I think he must have mistaken the name, and
fancied it a dinner to the sons of <i>Burke</i>'&mdash;meaning of
course the murderer. In short he fully confirmed
Jerrold in all respects." The same letter told me, too,
something of his reading. Jerrold's <i>Story of a Feather</i>
he had derived much enjoyment from. "Gauntwolf's
sickness and the career of that snuffbox, masterly.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> I
have been deep in Voyages and Travels, and in De
Foe. Tennyson I have also been reading, again and
again. What a great creature he is!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What about
the <i>Goldsmith?</i> Apropos, I am all eagerness to write
a story about the length of that most delightful of all
stories, the <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i>."</p>

<p>In the second week of September he went to meet
his brother Frederick at Marseilles, and bring him
back over the Cornice road to pass a fortnight's holiday
at Genoa; and his description of the first inn upon
the Alps they slept in is too good to be lost. "We
lay last night," he wrote (9th of September) "at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_137" id="Page_2_137">[137]</a></span>
first halting-place on this journey, in an inn which is
not entitled, as it ought to be, The house of call for
fleas and vermin in general, but is entitled the grand
hotel of the Post! I hardly know what to compare it
to. It seemed something like a house in Somers-town
originally built for a wine-vaults and never finished, but
grown very old. There was nothing to eat in it and
nothing to drink. They had lost the teapot; and
when they found it, they couldn't make out what had
become of the lid, which, turning up at last and being
fixed on to the teapot, couldn't be got off again for the
pouring in of more water. Fleas of elephantine dimensions
were gambolling boldly in the dirty beds; and
the mosquitoes!&mdash;But let me here draw a curtain (as I
would have done if there had been any). We had
scarcely any sleep, and rose up with hands and arms
hardly human."</p>

<p>In four days they were at Albaro, and the morning
after their arrival Dickens underwent the terrible shock
of seeing his brother very nearly drowned in the bay.
He swam out into too strong a current,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and was only
narrowly saved by the accident of a fishing-boat preparing
to leave the harbour at the time. "It was a
world of horror and anguish," Dickens wrote to me,
"crowded into four or five minutes of dreadful agitation;
and, to complete the terror of it, Georgy,
Charlotte" (the nurse), "and the children were on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_138" id="Page_2_138">[138]</a></span>
rock in full view of it all, crying, as you may suppose,
like mad creatures." His own bathing was from the
rock, and, as he had already told me, of the most
primitive kind. He went in whenever he pleased,
broke his head against sharp stones if he went in with
that end foremost, floundered about till he was all over
bruises, and then climbed and staggered out again.
"Everybody wears a dress. Mine extremely theatrical:
Masaniello to the life: shall be preserved for your inspection
in Devonshire-terrace." I will add another
personal touch, also Masaniello-like, which marks the
beginning of a change which, though confined for the
present to his foreign residence and removed when he
came to England, was resumed somewhat later, and in
a few more years wholly altered the aspect of his face.
"The moustaches are glorious, glorious. I have cut
them shorter, and trimmed them a little at the ends to
improve the shape. They are charming, charming.
Without them, life would be a blank."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the last week of September they moved from
Albaro into Genoa, amid a violent storm of wind and
wet, "great guns blowing," the lightning incessant,
and the rain driving down in a dense thick cloud.
But the worst of the storm was over when they reached
the Peschiere. As they passed into it along the stately
old terraces, flanked on either side with antique sculptured
figures, all the seven fountains were playing in
its gardens, and the sun was shining brightly on its
groves of camellias and orange-trees.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful place, and I soon became familiar
with the several rooms that were to form their home
for the rest of their stay in Italy. In the centre was
the grand sala, fifty feet high, of an area larger than
"the dining-room of the Academy," and painted,
walls and ceiling, with frescoes three hundred years
old, "as fresh as if the colours had been laid on yesterday."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_140" id="Page_2_140">[140]</a></span>
On the same floor as this great hall were a
drawing-room, and a dining-room,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> both covered also
with frescoes still bright enough to make them thoroughly
cheerful, and both so nicely proportioned as
to give to their bigness all the effect of snugness.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
Out of these opened three other chambers that were
turned into sleeping-rooms and nurseries. Adjoining
the sala, right and left, were the two best bedrooms;
"in size and shape like those at Windsor-castle but
greatly higher;" both having altars, a range of three
windows with stone balconies, floors tesselated in patterns
of black and white stone, and walls painted every
inch: on the left, nymphs pursued by satyrs "as large
as life and as wicked;" on the right, "Phaeton larger
than life, with horses bigger than Meux and Co.'s,
tumbling headlong down into the best bed." The
right-hand one he occupied with his wife, and of the
left took possession as a study; writing behind a big
screen he had lugged into it, and placed by one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_141" id="Page_2_141">[141]</a></span>
windows, from which he could see over the city, as he
wrote, as far as the lighthouse in its harbour. Distant
little over a mile as the crow flew, flashing five times
in four minutes, and on dark nights, as if by magic,
illuminating brightly the whole palace-front every time
it shone, this lighthouse was one of the wonders of
Genoa.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image11.jpg" width="400" height="316" alt="Palace" title="Palace" />
</div>

<p>When it had all become more familiar to him, he
was fond of dilating on its beauties; and even the
dreary sound of the chaunting from neighbouring
mass-performances, as it floated in at all the open
windows, which at first was a sad trouble, came to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_142" id="Page_2_142">[142]</a></span>
have its charm for him. I remember a vivid account
he gave me of a great festa on the hill behind the
house, when the people alternately danced under tents
in the open air and rushed to say a prayer or two in
an adjoining church bright with red and gold and blue
and silver; so many minutes of dancing, and of praying,
in regular turns of each. But the view over into
Genoa, on clear bright days, was a never failing enjoyment.
The whole city then, without an atom of
smoke, and with every possible variety of tower and
steeple pointing up into the sky, lay stretched out
below his windows. To the right and left were lofty
hills, with every indentation in their rugged sides
sharply discernible; and on one side of the harbour
stretched away into the dim bright distance the whole
of the Cornice, its first highest range of mountains
hoary with snow. Sitting down one Spring day to
write to me, he thus spoke of the sea and of the
garden. "Beyond the town is the wide expanse of
the Mediterranean, as blue, at this moment, as the
most pure and vivid prussian blue on Mac's palette
when it is newly set; and on the horizon there is a
red flush, seen nowhere as it is here. Immediately
below the windows are the gardens of the house, with
gold fish swimming and diving in the fountains; and
below them, at the foot of a steep slope, the public
garden and drive, where the walks are marked out by
hedges of pink roses, which blush and shine through
the green trees and vines, close up to the balconies
of these windows. No custom can impair, and no
description enhance, the beauty of the scene."</p>

<p>All these and other glories and beauties, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_143" id="Page_2_143">[143]</a></span>
did not come to him at once. They counted for little
indeed when he first set himself seriously to write.
"Never did I stagger so upon a threshold before. I
seem as if I had plucked myself out of my proper soil
when I left Devonshire-terrace; and could take root
no more until I return to it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Did I tell you how
many fountains we have here? No matter. If they
played nectar, they wouldn't please me half so well
as the West Middlesex water-works at Devonshire-terrace."
The subject for his new Christmas story he
had chosen, but he had not found a title for it, or the
machinery to work it with; when, at the moment of
what seemed to be his greatest trouble, both reliefs
came. Sitting down one morning resolute for work,
though against the grain, his hand being out and everything
inviting to idleness, such a peal of chimes arose
from the city as he found to be "maddening." All
Genoa lay beneath him, and up from it, with some
sudden set of the wind, came in one fell sound the
clang and clash of all its steeples, pouring into his ears,
again and again, in a tuneless, grating, discordant,
jerking, hideous vibration that made his ideas "spin
round and round till they lost themselves in a whirl of
vexation and giddiness, and dropped down dead."
He had never before so suffered, nor did he again; but
this was his description to me next day, and his excuse
for having failed in a promise to send me his title.
Only two days later, however, came a letter in which
not a syllable was written but "We have heard <span class="smcap">the
Chimes</span> at midnight, Master Shallow!" and I knew
he had discovered what he wanted.</p>

<p>Other difficulties were still to be got over. He craved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_144" id="Page_2_144">[144]</a></span>
for the London streets. He so missed his long night-walks
before beginning anything that he seemed, as
he said, dumbfounded without them. "I can't help
thinking of the boy in the school-class whose button
was cut off by Walter Scott and his friends. Put me
down on Waterloo-bridge at eight o'clock in the evening,
with leave to roam about as long as I like, and I
would come home, as you know, panting to go on. I
am sadly strange as it is, and can't settle. You will
have lots of hasty notes from me while I am at work;
but you know your man; and whatever strikes me, I
shall let off upon you as if I were in Devonshire-terrace.
It's a great thing to have my title, and see
my way how to work the bells. Let them clash upon me
now from all the churches and convents in Genoa, I
see nothing but the old London belfry I have set them
in. In my mind's eye, Horatio. I like more and
more my notion of making, in this little book, a great
blow for the poor. Something powerful, I think I can
do, but I want to be tender too, and cheerful; as like
the <i>Carol</i> in that respect as may be, and as unlike it as
such a thing can be. The duration of the action will
resemble it a little, but I trust to the novelty of the
machinery to carry that off; and if my design be anything
at all, it has a grip upon the very throat of the
time." (8th of October.)</p>

<p>Thus bent upon his work, for which he never had
been in more earnest mood, he was disturbed by hearing
that he must attend the levee of the Governor who
had unexpectedly arrived in the city, and who would
take it as an affront, his eccentric friend Fletcher told
him, if that courtesy were not immediately paid. "It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_145" id="Page_2_145">[145]</a></span>
was the morning on which I was going to begin, so I
wrote round to our consul,"&mdash;praying, of course, that
excuse should be made for him. Don't bother yourself,
replied that sensible functionary, for all the consuls
and governors alive; but shut yourself up by all
means. "So," continues Dickens, telling me the tale,
"he went next morning in great state and full costume,
to present two English gentlemen. 'Where's the great
poet?' said the Governor. 'I want to see the great
poet.' 'The great poet, your excellency,' said the
consul, 'is at work, writing a book, and begged me to
make his excuses.' 'Excuses!' said the Governor, 'I
wouldn't interfere with such an occupation for all the
world. Pray tell him that my house is open to the
honour of his presence when it is perfectly convenient
for him; but not otherwise. And let no gentleman,'
said the Governor, a surweyin' of his suite with a majestic
eye, 'call upon Signor Dickens till he is understood
to be disengaged.' And he sent somebody with
his own cards next day. Now I <i>do</i> seriously call this,
real politeness and pleasant consideration&mdash;not positively
American, but still gentlemanly and polished.
The same spirit pervades the inferior departments; and
I have not been required to observe the usual police
regulations, or to put myself to the slightest trouble
about anything." (18th of October.)</p>

<p>The picture I am now to give of him at work should
be prefaced by a word or two that may throw light on
the design he was working at. It was a large theme
for so small an instrument; and the disproportion was
not more characteristic of the man, than the throes of
suffering and passion to be presently undergone by him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_146" id="Page_2_146">[146]</a></span>
for results that many men would smile at. He was
bent, as he says, on striking a blow for the poor. They
had always been his clients, they had never been forgotten
in any of his books, but here nothing else was
to be remembered. He had become, in short, terribly
earnest in the matter. Several months before he left
England, I had noticed in him the habit of more
gravely regarding many things before passed lightly
enough; the hopelessness of any true solution of either
political or social problems by the ordinary Downing-street
methods had been startlingly impressed on him
in Carlyle's writings; and in the parliamentary talk
of that day he had come to have as little faith for the
putting down of any serious evil, as in a then notorious
city Alderman's gabble for the putting down of suicide.
The latter had stirred his indignation to its depths just
before he came to Italy, and his increased opportunities
of solitary reflection since had strengthened and
extended it. When he came therefore to think of his
new story for Christmas time, he resolved to make it a
plea for the poor. He did not want it to resemble
his <i>Carol</i>, but the same kind of moral was in his mind.
He was to try and convert Society, as he had converted
Scrooge, by showing that its happiness rested on the
same foundations as those of the individual, which are
mercy and charity not less than justice. Whether right
or wrong in these assumptions, need not be questioned
here, where facts are merely stated to render intelligible
what will follow; he had not made politics at any
time a study, and they were always an instinct with
him rather than a science; but the instinct was wholesome
and sound, and to set class against class never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_147" id="Page_2_147">[147]</a></span>
ceased to be as odious to him as he thought it righteous
at all times to help each to a kindlier knowledge of the
other. And so, here in Italy, amid the grand surroundings
of this Palazzo Peschiere, the hero of his
imagination was to be a sorry old drudge of a London
ticket-porter, who in his anxiety not to distrust or
think hardly of the rich, has fallen into the opposite
extreme of distrusting the poor. From such distrust
it is the object of the story to reclaim him; and, to
the writer of it, the tale became itself of less moment
than what he thus intended it to enforce. Far beyond
mere vanity in authorship went the passionate zeal with
which he began, and the exultation with which he
finished, this task. When we met at its close, he was
fresh from Venice, which had impressed him as "the
wonder" and "the new sensation" of the world: but
well do I remember how high above it all arose the
hope that filled his mind. "Ah!" he said to me,
"when I saw those places, how I thought that to leave
one's hand upon the time, lastingly upon the time, with
one tender touch for the mass of toiling people that
nothing could obliterate, would be to lift oneself above
the dust of all the Doges in their graves, and stand
upon a giant's staircase that Sampson couldn't overthrow!"
In varying forms this ambition was in all
his life.</p>

<p>Another incident of these days will exhibit aspirations
of a more solemn import that were not less part of his
nature. It was depth of sentiment rather than clearness
of faith which kept safe the belief on which they
rested against all doubt or question of its sacredness,
but every year seemed to strengthen it in him. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_148" id="Page_2_148">[148]</a></span>
was told me in his second letter after reaching the Peschiere;
the first having sent me some such commissions
in regard to his wife's family as his kindly care for all
connected with him frequently led to. "Let me tell
you," he wrote (30th of September), "of a curious
dream I had, last Monday night; and of the fragments
of reality I can collect; which helped to make it up. I
have had a return of rheumatism in my back, and
knotted round my waist like a girdle of pain; and had
laid awake nearly all that night under the infliction,
when I fell asleep and dreamed this dream. Observe
that throughout I was as real, animated, and full of
passion as Macready (God bless him!) in the last scene
of <i>Macbeth</i>. In an indistinct place, which was quite
sublime in its indistinctness, I was visited by a Spirit.
I could not make out the face, nor do I recollect that
I desired to do so. It wore a blue drapery, as the Madonna
might in a picture by Raphael; and bore no resemblance
to any one I have known except in stature.
I think (but I am not sure) that I recognized the voice.
Anyway, I knew it was poor Mary's spirit. I was not
at all afraid, but in a great delight, so that I wept very
much, and stretching out my arms to it called it 'Dear.'
At this, I thought it recoiled; and I felt immediately,
that not being of my gross nature, I ought not to have
addressed it so familiarly. 'Forgive me!' I said. 'We
poor living creatures are only able to express ourselves
by looks and words. I have used the word most natural
to <i>our</i> affections; and you know my heart.' It was
so full of compassion and sorrow for me&mdash;which I knew
spiritually, for, as I have said, I didn't perceive its
emotions by its face&mdash;that it cut me to the heart; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_149" id="Page_2_149">[149]</a></span>
I said, sobbing, 'Oh! give me some token that you
have really visited me!' 'Form a wish,' it said. I
thought, reasoning with myself: 'If I form a selfish
wish, it will vanish.' So I hastily discarded such hopes
and anxieties of my own as came into my mind, and
said, 'Mrs. Hogarth is surrounded with great distresses'&mdash;observe,
I never thought of saying 'your mother' as
to a mortal creature&mdash;'will you extricate her?' 'Yes.'
'And her extrication is to be a certainty to me, that this
has really happened?' 'Yes.' 'But answer me one other
question!' I said, in an agony of entreaty lest it should
leave me. 'What is the True religion?' As it paused
a moment without replying, I said&mdash;Good God in such
an agony of haste, lest it should go away!&mdash;'You think,
as I do, that the Form of religion does not so greatly
matter, if we try to do good? or,' I said, observing that
it still hesitated, and was moved with the greatest compassion
for me, 'perhaps the Roman Catholic is the
best? perhaps it makes one think of God oftener, and
believe in him more steadily?' 'For <i>you</i>,' said the
Spirit, full of such heavenly tenderness for me, that I
felt as if my heart would break; 'for <i>you</i>, it is the best!'
Then I awoke, with the tears running down my face,
and myself in exactly the condition of the dream. It
was just dawn. I called up Kate, and repeated it three
or four times over, that I might not unconsciously make
it plainer or stronger afterwards. It was exactly this.
Free from all hurry, nonsense, or confusion, whatever.
Now, the strings I can gather up, leading to this, were
three. The first you know, from the main subject of
my last letter. The second was, that there is a great
altar in our bed-room, at which some family who once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_150" id="Page_2_150">[150]</a></span>
inhabited this palace had mass performed in old time:
and I had observed within myself, before going to bed,
that there was a mark in the wall, above the sanctuary,
where a religious picture used to be; and I had wondered
within myself what the subject might have been,
<i>and what the face was like</i>. Thirdly, I had been listening
to the convent bells (which ring at intervals in the
night), and so had thought, no doubt, of Roman Catholic
services. And yet, for all this, put the case of that
wish being fulfilled by any agency in which I had no
hand; and I wonder whether I should regard it as a
dream, or an actual Vision!" It was perhaps natural
that he should omit, from his own considerations awakened
by the dream, the very first that would have risen
in any mind to which his was intimately known&mdash;that
it strengthens other evidences, of which there are many
in his life, of his not having escaped those trying regions
of reflection which most men of thought and all men of
genius have at some time to pass through. In such disturbing
fancies during the next year or two, I may add
that the book which helped him most was the <i>Life of
Arnold</i>. "I respect and reverence his memory," he
wrote to me in the middle of October, in reply to my
mention of what had most attracted myself in it, "beyond
all expression. I must have that book. Every
sentence that you quote from it is the text-book of my
faith."</p>

<p>He kept his promise that I should hear from him
while writing, and I had frequent letters when he was
fairly in his work. "With my steam very much up, I
find it a great trial to be so far off from you, and consequently
to have no one (always excepting Kate and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_151" id="Page_2_151">[151]</a></span>
Georgy) to whom to expatiate on my day's work. And
I want a crowded street to plunge into at night. And
I want to be 'on the spot' as it were. But apart from
such things, the life I lead is favourable to work." In
his next letter: "I am in regular, ferocious excitement
with the <i>Chimes;</i> get up at seven; have a cold bath before
breakfast; and blaze away, wrathful and red-hot,
until three o'clock or so; when I usually knock off
(unless it rains) for the day .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am fierce to finish in a
spirit bearing some affinity to those of truth and mercy,
and to shame the cruel and the canting. I have not
forgotten my catechism. 'Yes verily, and with God's
help, so I will!'"</p>

<p>Within a week he had completed his first part, or
quarter. "I send you to-day" (18th of October), "by
mail, the first and longest of the four divisions. This
is great for the first week, which is usually up-hill. I
have kept a copy in shorthand in case of accidents. I
hope to send you a parcel every Monday until the whole
is done. I do not wish to influence you, but it has a
great hold upon me, and has affected me, in the doing,
in divers strong ways, deeply, forcibly. To give you
better means of judgment I will sketch for you the general
idea, but pray don't read it until you have read
this first part of the MS." I print it here. It is a
good illustration of his method in all his writing. His
idea is in it so thoroughly, that, by comparison with
the tale as printed, we see the strength of its mastery
over his first design. Thus always, whether his tale
was to be written in one or in twenty numbers, his
fancies controlled him. He never, in any of his books,
accomplished what he had wholly preconceived, often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_152" id="Page_2_152">[152]</a></span>
as he attempted it. Few men of genius ever did. Once
at the sacred heat that opens regions beyond ordinary
vision, imagination has its own laws; and where characters
are so real as to be treated as existences, their
creator himself cannot help them having their own wills
and ways. Fern the farm-labourer is not here, nor yet
his niece the little Lilian (at first called Jessie) who is
to give to the tale its most tragical scene; and there
are intimations of poetic fancy at the close of my sketch
which the published story fell short of. Altogether the
comparison is worth observing.</p>

<p>"The general notion is this. That what happens to
poor Trotty in the first part, and what will happen to
him in the second (when he takes the letter to a punctual
and a great man of business, who is balancing his
books and making up his accounts, and complacently
expatiating on the necessity of clearing off every liability
and obligation, and turning over a new leaf and
starting fresh with the new year), so dispirits him, who
can't do this, that he comes to the conclusion that his
class and order have no business with a new year, and
really are 'intruding.' And though he will pluck up
for an hour or so, at the christening (I think) of a
neighbour's child, that evening: still, when he goes
home, Mr. Filer's precepts will come into his mind,
and he will say to himself, 'we are a long way past the
proper average of children, and it has no business to
be born:' and will be wretched again. And going
home, and sitting there alone, he will take that newspaper
out of his pocket, and reading of the crimes and
offences of the poor, especially of those whom Alderman
Cute is going to put down, will be quite confirmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_153" id="Page_2_153">[153]</a></span>
in his misgiving that they are bad; irredeemably bad.
In this state of mind, he will fancy that the Chimes are
calling, to him; and saying to himself 'God help me.
Let me go up to 'em. I feel as if I were going to die
in despair&mdash;of a broken heart; let me die among the
bells that have been a comfort to me!'&mdash;will grope his
way up into the tower; and fall down in a kind of
swoon among them. Then the third quarter, or in
other words the beginning of the second half of the
book, will open with the Goblin part of the thing:
the bells ringing, and innumerable spirits (the sound
or vibration of them) flitting and tearing in and out
of the church-steeple, and bearing all sorts of missions
and commissions and reminders and reproaches,
and comfortable recollections and what not, to all
sorts of people and places. Some bearing scourges;
and others flowers, and birds, and music; and others
pleasant faces in mirrors, and others ugly ones: the
bells haunting people in the night (especially the
last of the old year) according to their deeds. And
the bells themselves, who have a goblin likeness to
humanity in the midst of their proper shapes, and who
shine in a light of their own, will say (the Great Bell
being the chief spokesman) Who is he that being of
the poor doubts the right of poor men to the inheritance
which Time reserves for them, and echoes an unmeaning
cry against his fellows? Toby, all aghast,
will tell him it is he, and why it is. Then the spirits
of the bells will bear him through the air to various
scenes, charged with this trust: That they show him
how the poor and wretched, at the worst&mdash;yes, even
in the crimes that aldermen put down, and he has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_154" id="Page_2_154">[154]</a></span>
thought so horrible&mdash;have some deformed and hunchbacked
goodness clinging to them; and how they have
their right and share in Time. Following out the
history of Meg the Bells will show her, that marriage
broken off and all friends dead, with an infant child;
reduced so low, and made so miserable, as to be brought
at last to wander out at night. And in Toby's sight,
her father's, she will resolve to drown herself and the
child together. But before she goes down to the water,
Toby will see how she covers it with a part of her own
wretched dress, and adjusts its rags so as to make it
pretty in its sleep, and hangs over it, and smooths its
little limbs, and loves it with the dearest love that God
ever gave to mortal creatures; and when she runs down
to the water, Toby will cry 'Oh spare her! Chimes,
have mercy on her! Stop her!'&mdash;and the bells will say,
'Why stop her? She is bad at heart&mdash;let the bad die.'
And Toby on his knees will beg and pray for mercy:
and in the end the bells will stop her, by their voices,
just in time. Toby will see, too, what great things
the punctual man has left undone on the close of the
old year, and what accounts he has left unsettled:
punctual as he is. And he will see a great many things
about Richard, once so near being his son-in-law, and
about a great many people. And the moral of it all
will be, that he has his portion in the new year no less
than any other man, and that the poor require a deal
of beating out of shape before their human shape is
gone; that even in their frantic wickedness there may
be good in their hearts triumphantly asserting itself,
though all the aldermen alive say 'No,' as he has learnt
from the agony of his own child; and that the truth is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_155" id="Page_2_155">[155]</a></span>
Trustfulness in them, not doubt, nor putting down, nor
filing them away. And when at last a great sea rises,
and this sea of Time comes sweeping down, bearing
the alderman and such mudworms of the earth away to
nothing, dashing them to fragments in its fury&mdash;Toby
will climb a rock and hear the bells (now faded from
his sight) pealing out upon the waters. And as he
hears them, and looks round for help, he will wake up
and find himself with the newspaper lying at his foot;
and Meg sitting opposite to him at the table, making
up the ribbons for her wedding to-morrow; and the
window open, that the sound of the bells ringing the
old year out and the new year in may enter. They
will just have broken out, joyfully; and Richard will
dash in to kiss Meg before Toby, and have the first kiss
of the new year (he'll get it too); and the neighbours
will crowd round with good wishes; and a band will
strike up gaily (Toby knows a Drum in private); and
the altered circumstances, and the ringing of the bells,
and the jolly musick, will so transport the old fellow
that he will lead off a country dance forthwith in an
entirely new step, consisting of his old familiar trot.
Then quoth the inimitable&mdash;Was it a dream of Toby's
after all? Or is Toby but a dream? and Meg a dream?
and all a dream! In reference to which, and the realities
of which dreams are born, the inimitable will be
wiser than he can be now, writing for dear life, with
the post just going, and the brave C booted.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah
how I hate myself, my dear fellow, for this lame and
halting outline of the Vision I have in my mind. But
it must go to you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You will say what is best for
the frontispiece".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_156" id="Page_2_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>With the second part or quarter, after a week's interval,
came announcement of the enlargement of his
plan, by which he hoped better to carry out the scheme
of the story, and to get, for its following part, an effect
for his heroine that would increase the tragic interest.
"I am still in stout heart with the tale. I think it well-timed
and a good thought; and as you know I wouldn't
say so to anybody else, I don't mind saying freely thus
much. It has great possession of me every moment in
the day; and drags me where it will.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If you only
could have read it all at once!&mdash;But you never would
have done that, anyway, for I never should have been
able to keep it to myself; so that's nonsense. I hope
you'll like it. I would give a hundred pounds (and
think it cheap) to see you read it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Never mind."</p>

<p>That was the first hint of an intention of which I
was soon to hear more; but meanwhile, after eight
more days, the third part came, with the scene from
which he expected so much, and with a mention of
what the writing of it had cost him. "This book
(whether in the Hajji Baba sense or not I can't say,
but certainly in the literal one) has made my face white
in a foreign land. My cheeks, which were beginning
to fill out, have sunk again; my eyes have grown immensely
large; my hair is very lank; and the head
inside the hair is hot and giddy. Read the scene at
the end of the third part, twice. I wouldn't write it
twice, for something.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You will see that I have
substituted the name of Lilian for Jessie. It is prettier
in sound, and suits my music better. I mention this,
lest you should wonder who and what I mean by that
name. To-morrow I shall begin afresh (starting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_157" id="Page_2_157">[157]</a></span>
next part with a broad grin, and ending it with the
very soul of jollity and happiness); and I hope to finish
by next Monday at latest. Perhaps on Saturday. I
hope you will like the little book. Since I conceived,
at the beginning of the second part, what must happen
in the third, I have undergone as much sorrow and
agitation as if the thing were real; and have wakened
up with it at night. I was obliged to lock myself in
when I finished it yesterday, for my face was swollen
for the time to twice its proper size, and was hugely
ridiculous."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His letter ended abruptly. "I am
going for a long walk, to clear my head. I feel that
I am very shakey from work, and throw down my pen
for the day. There! (That's where it fell.)" A huge
blot represented it, and, as Hamlet says, the rest was
silence.</p>

<p>Two days later, answering a letter from me that had
reached in the interval, he gave sprightlier account of
himself, and described a happy change in the weather.
Up to this time, he protested, they had not had more
than four or five clear days. All the time he had been
writing they had been wild and stormy. "Wind,
hail, rain, thunder and lightning. To-day," just before
he sent me his last manuscript, "has been November
slack-baked, the sirocco having come back; and to-night
it blows great guns with a raging storm."
"Weather worse," he wrote after three Mondays, "than
any November English weather I have ever beheld, or
any weather I have had experience of anywhere. So
horrible to-day that all power has been rained and
gloomed out of me. Yesterday, in pure determination
to get the better of it, I walked twelve miles in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_158" id="Page_2_158">[158]</a></span>
mountain rain. You never saw it rain. Scotland and
America are nothing to it." But now all this was over.
"The weather changed on Saturday night, and has
been glorious ever since. I am afraid to say more in
its favour, lest it should change again." It did not. I
think there were no more complainings. I heard now
of autumn days with the mountain wind lovely, enjoyable,
exquisite past expression. I heard of mountain
walks behind the Peschiere, most beautiful and fresh,
among which, and along the beds of dry rivers and
torrents, he could "pelt away," in any dress, without
encountering a soul but the contadini. I heard of his
starting off one day after finishing work, "fifteen miles
to dinner&mdash;oh my stars! at such an inn!!!" On another
day, of a party to dinner at their pleasant little
banker's at Quinto six miles off, to which, while the
ladies drove, he was able "to walk in the sun of the
middle of the day and to walk home again at night."
On another, of an expedition up the mountain on
mules. And on another of a memorable tavern-dinner
with their merchant friend Mr. Curry, in which there
were such successions of surprising dishes of genuine
native cookery that they took two hours in the serving,
but of the component parts of not one of which was he
able to form the remotest conception: the site of the
tavern being on the city wall, its name in Italian sounding
very romantic and meaning "the Whistle," and
its bill of fare kept for an experiment to which, before
another month should be over, he dared and challenged
my cookery in Lincoln's-inn.</p>

<p>A visit from him to London was to be expected
almost immediately! That all remonstrance would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_159" id="Page_2_159">[159]</a></span>
idle, under the restless excitement his work had
awakened, I well knew. It was not merely the wish
he had, natural enough, to see the last proofs and the
woodcuts before the day of publication, which he could
not otherwise do; but it was the stronger and more
eager wish, before that final launch, to have a vivider
sense than letters could give him of the effect of what
he had been doing. "If I come, I shall put up at
Cuttris's" (then the Piazza-hotel in Covent-garden)
"that I may be close to you. Don't say to anybody,
except our immediate friends, that I am coming. Then
I shall not be bothered. If I should preserve my
present fierce writing humour, in any pass I may run
to Venice, Bologna, and Florence, before I turn my
face towards Lincoln's-inn-fields; and come to England
by Milan and Turin. But this of course depends
in a great measure on your reply." My reply, dwelling
on the fatigue and cost, had the reception I foresaw.
"Notwithstanding what you say, I am still in the same
mind about coming to London. Not because the
proofs concern me at all (I should be an ass as well as
a thankless vagabond if they did), but because of that
unspeakable restless something which would render it
almost as impossible for me to remain here and not see
the thing complete, as it would be for a full balloon,
left to itself, not to go up. I do not intend coming
from <i>here</i>, but by way of Milan and Turin (previously
going to Venice), and so, across the wildest pass of the
Alps that may be open, to Strasburg.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As you dislike
the Young England gentleman I shall knock him
out, and replace him by a man (I can dash him in at
your rooms in an hour) who recognizes no virtue in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_160" id="Page_2_160">[160]</a></span>
anything but the good old times, and talks of them,
parrot-like, whatever the matter is. A real good old
city tory, in a blue coat and bright buttons and a white
cravat, and with a tendency of blood to the head.
File away at Filer, as you please; but bear in mind
that the <i>Westminster Review</i> considered Scrooge's presentation
of the turkey to Bob Cratchit as grossly incompatible
with political economy. I don't care at all
for the skittle-playing." These were among things I
had objected to.</p>

<p>But the close of his letter revealed more than its
opening of the reason, not at once so frankly confessed,
for the long winter-journey he was about to make; and
if it be thought that, in printing the passage, I take a
liberty with my friend, it will be found that equal
liberty is taken with myself, whom it goodnaturedly
caricatures; so that the reader can enjoy his laugh at
either or both. "Shall I confess to you, I particularly
want Carlyle above all to see it before the rest of the
world, when it is done; and I should like to inflict the
little story on him and on dear old gallant Macready
with my own lips, and to have Stanny and the other
Mac sitting by. Now, if you was a real gent, you'd
get up a little circle for me, one wet evening, when I
come to town: and would say, 'My boy (<span class="smcap">sir</span>, will you
have the goodness to leave those books alone and to go
downstairs&mdash;<span class="smcap">What</span> the Devil are you doing! And
mind, sir, I can see nobody&mdash;do you hear? Nobody.
I am particularly engaged with a gentleman from Asia)&mdash;My
boy, would you give us that little Christmas book
(a little Christmas book of Dickens's, Macready, which
I'm anxious you should hear); and don't slur it, now,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_161" id="Page_2_161">[161]</a></span>
or be too fast, Dickens, please!'&mdash;I say, if you was a
real gent, something to this effect might happen. I
shall be under sailing orders the moment I have finished.
And I shall produce myself (please God) in London on
the very day you name. For one week: to the hour."</p>

<p>The wish was complied with, of course; and that
night in Lincoln's-inn-fields led to rather memorable
issues. His next letter told me the little tale was done.
"Third of November, 1844. Half-past two, afternoon.
Thank God! I have finished the <i>Chimes</i>. This moment.
I take up my pen again to-day; to say only that much;
and to add that I have had what women call 'a real
good cry!'" Very genuine all this, it is hardly necessary
to say. The little book thus completed was not
one of his greater successes, and it raised him up some
objectors; but there was that in it which more than
repaid the suffering its writing cost him, and the enmity
its opinions provoked; and in his own heart it had a
cherished corner to the last. The intensity of it
seemed always best to represent to himself what he
hoped to be longest remembered for; and exactly
what he felt as to this, his friend Jeffrey warmly expressed.
"All the tribe of selfishness, and cowardice
and cant, will hate you in their hearts, and cavil when
they can; will accuse you of wicked exaggeration, and
excitement to discontent, and what they pleasantly call
disaffection! But never mind. The good and the
brave are with you, and the truth also."</p>

<p>He resumed his letter on the fourth of November.
"Here is the brave courier measuring bits of maps
with a carving-fork, and going up mountains on a teaspoon.
He and I start on Wednesday for Parma, Modena,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_162" id="Page_2_162">[162]</a></span>
Bologna, Venice, Verona, Brescia, and Milan.
Milan being within a reasonable journey from here,
Kate and Georgy will come to meet me when I arrive
there on my way towards England; and will bring me
all letters from you. I shall be there on the 18th.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Now, you know my punctiwality. Frost, ice,
flooded rivers, steamers, horses, passports, and custom-houses
may damage it. But my design is, to walk into
Cuttris's coffee-room on Sunday the 1st of December,
in good time for dinner. I shall look for you at the
farther table by the fire&mdash;where we generally go.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But the party for the night following? I know you
have consented to the party. Let me see. Don't have
any one, this particular night, to dinner, but let it be a
summons for the special purpose at half-past 6. Carlyle,
indispensable, and I should like his wife of all
things: <i>her</i> judgment would be invaluable. You will
ask Mac, and why not his sister? Stanny and Jerrold
I should particularly wish; Edwin Landseer; Blanchard;
perhaps Harness; and what say you to Fonblanque
and Fox? I leave it to you. You know the effect I
want to try .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Think the <i>Chimes</i> a letter, my dear
fellow, and forgive this. I will not fail to write to you
on my travels. Most probably from Venice. And
when I meet you (in sound health I hope) oh Heaven!
what a week we will have."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> it all fell out accordingly. He parted from his
disconsolate wife, as he told me in his first letter from
Ferrara, on Wednesday the 6th of November: left her
shut up in her palace like a baron's lady in the time of
the crusades; and had his first real experience of the
wonders of Italy. He saw Parma, Modena, Bologna,
Ferrara, Venice, Verona, and Mantua. As to all which
the impressions conveyed to me in his letters have been
more or less given in his published <i>Pictures</i>. They are
charmingly expressed. There is a sketch of a cicerone
at Bologna which will remain in his books among their
many delightful examples of his unerring and loving
perception for every gentle, heavenly, and tender soul,
under whatever conventional disguise it wanders here
on earth, whether as poorhouse orphan or lawyer's clerk,
architect's pupil at Salisbury or cheerful little guide to
graves at Bologna; and there is another memorable
description in his Rembrandt sketch, in form of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_164" id="Page_2_164">[164]</a></span>
dream, of the silent, unearthly, watery wonders of
Venice. This last, though not written until after his
London visit, had been prefigured so vividly in what
he wrote at once from the spot, that those passages
from his letter<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> may be read still with a quite undiminished
interest. "I must not," he said, "anticipate
myself. But, my dear fellow, nothing in the world that
ever you have heard of Venice, is equal to the magnificent
and stupendous reality. The wildest visions of the
Arabian Nights are nothing to the piazza of Saint Mark,
and the first impression of the inside of the church.
The gorgeous and wonderful reality of Venice is beyond
the fancy of the wildest dreamer. Opium couldn't
build such a place, and enchantment couldn't shadow
it forth in a vision. All that I have heard of it, read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_165" id="Page_2_165">[165]</a></span>
of it in truth or fiction, fancied of it, is left thousands
of miles behind. You know that I am liable to disappointment
in such things from over-expectation, but
Venice is above, beyond, out of all reach of coming
near, the imagination of a man. It has never been
rated high enough. It is a thing you would shed tears
to see. When I came <i>on board</i> here last night (after a
five miles' row in a gondola; which somehow or other,
I wasn't at all prepared for); when, from seeing the
city lying, one light, upon the distant water, like a
ship, I came plashing through the silent and deserted
streets; I felt as if the houses were reality&mdash;the water,
fever-madness. But when, in the bright, cold, bracing
day, I stood upon the piazza, this morning, by Heaven
the glory of the place was insupportable! And diving
down from that into its wickedness and gloom&mdash;its
awful prisons, deep below the water; its judgment
chambers, secret doors, deadly nooks, where the
torches you carry with you blink as if they couldn't
bear the air in which the frightful scenes were acted;
and coming out again into the radiant, unsubstantial
Magic of the town; and diving in again, into vast
churches, and old tombs&mdash;a new sensation, a new
memory, a new mind came upon me. Venice is a bit
of my brain from this time. My dear Forster, if you
could share my transports (as you would if you were
here) what would I not give! I feel cruel not to have
brought Kate and Georgy; positively cruel and base.
Canaletti and Stanny, miraculous in their truth.
Turner, very noble. But the reality itself, beyond all
pen or pencil. I never saw the thing before that I
should be afraid to describe. But to tell what Venice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_166" id="Page_2_166">[166]</a></span>
is, I feel to be an impossibility. And here I sit alone,
writing it: with nothing to urge me on, or goad me to
that estimate, which, speaking of it to anyone I loved,
and being spoken to in return, would lead me to form.
In the sober solitude of a famous inn; with the great
bell of Saint Mark ringing twelve at my elbow; with
three arched windows in my room (two stories high)
looking down upon the grand canal and away, beyond,
to where the sun went down to-night in a blaze; and
thinking over again those silent speaking faces of
Titian and Tintoretto; I swear (uncooled by any humbug
I have seen) that Venice is <i>the</i> wonder and the new
sensation of the world! If you could be set down in
it, never having heard of it, it would still be so. With
your foot upon its stones, its pictures before you, and
its history in your mind, it is something past all writing
of or speaking of&mdash;almost past all thinking of.
You couldn't talk to me in this room, nor I to you,
without shaking hands and saying 'Good God my dear
fellow, have we lived to see this!'"</p>

<p>Five days later, Sunday the 17th, he was at Lodi,
from which he wrote to me that he had been, like Leigh
Hunt's pig, up "all manner of streets" since he left
his palazzo; that with one exception he had not on
any night given up more than five hours to rest; that
all the days except two had been bad ("the last two
foggy as Blackfriars-bridge on Lord Mayor's day");
and that the cold had been dismal. But what cheerful,
keen, observant eyes he carried everywhere; and, in
the midst of new and unaccustomed scenes, and of
objects and remains of art for which no previous study
had prepared him, with what a delicate play of imagination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_167" id="Page_2_167">[167]</a></span>
and fancy the minuteness and accuracy of his
ordinary vision was exalted and refined; I think strikingly
shown by the few unstudied passages I am preserving
from these friendly letters. He saw everything
for himself; and from mistakes in judging for himself
which not all the learning and study in the world will
save ordinary men, the intuition of genius almost always
saved him. Hence there is hardly anything uttered by
him, of this much-trodden and wearisomely-visited, but
eternally beautiful and interesting country, that will not
be found worth listening to.</p>

<p>"I am already brim-full of cant about pictures, and
shall be happy to enlighten you on the subject of the
different schools, at any length you please. It seems
to me that the preposterous exaggeration in which
our countrymen delight in reference to this Italy,
hardly extends to the really good things.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_168" id="Page_2_168">[168]</a></span>
it is in its nature, that there it should fall short. I
have never seen any praise of Titian's great picture
of the Transfiguration of the Virgin at Venice, which
soared half as high as the beautiful and amazing
reality. It is perfection. Tintoretto's picture too, of
the Assembly of the Blest, at Venice also, with all the
lines in it (it is of immense size and the figures
are countless) tending majestically and dutifully to
Almighty God in the centre, is grand and noble in the
extreme. There are some wonderful portraits there,
besides; and some confused, and hurried, and slaughterous
battle pieces, in which the surprising art that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_169" id="Page_2_169">[169]</a></span>
presents the generals to your eye, so that it is almost
impossible you can miss them in a crowd though they
are in the thick of it, is very pleasant to dwell upon.
I have seen some delightful pictures; and some (at
Verona and Mantua) really too absurd and ridiculous
even to laugh at. Hampton-court is a fool to 'em&mdash;and
oh there are some rum 'uns there, my friend.
Some werry rum 'uns.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Two things are clear to me
already. One is, that the rules of art are much too
slavishly followed; making it a pain to you, when you
go into galleries day after day, to be so very precisely
sure where this figure will be turning round, and that
figure will be lying down, and that other will have a
great lot of drapery twined about him, and so forth.
This becomes a perfect nightmare. The second is,
that these great men, who were of necessity very much
in the hands of the monks and priests, painted monks
and priests a vast deal too often. I constantly see, in
pictures of tremendous power, heads quite below the
story and the painter; and I invariably observe that
those heads are of the convent stamp, and have their
counterparts, exactly, in the convent inmates of this
hour. I see the portraits of monks I know at Genoa,
in all the lame parts of strong paintings: so I have
settled with myself that in such cases the lameness was
not with the painter, but with the vanity and ignorance
of his employers, who <i>would</i> be apostles on canvas at
all events."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>In the same letter he described the Inns. "It is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_170" id="Page_2_170">[170]</a></span>
great thing&mdash;quite a matter of course&mdash;with English
travellers, to decry the Italian inns. Of course you
have no comforts that you are used to in England; and
travelling alone, you dine in your bedroom always.
Which is opposed to our habits. But they are immeasurably
better than you would suppose. The
attendants are very quick; very punctual; and so
obliging, if you speak to them politely, that you
would be a beast not to look cheerful, and take everything
pleasantly. I am writing this in a room like a
room on the two-pair front of an unfinished house in
Eaton-square: the very walls make me feel as if I were
a bricklayer distinguished by Mr. Cubitt with the favour
of having it to take care of. The windows won't
open, and the doors won't shut; and these latter (a cat
could get in, between them and the floor) have a windy
command of a colonnade which is open to the night,
so that my slippers positively blow off my feet, and
make little circuits in the room&mdash;like leaves. There is
a very ashy wood-fire, burning on an immense hearth
which has no fender (there is no such thing in Italy);
and it only knows two extremes&mdash;an agony of heat when
wood is put on, and an agony of cold when it has been
on two minutes. There is also an uncomfortable stain
in the wall, where the fifth door (not being strictly
indispensable) was walled up a year or two ago, and
never painted over. But the bed is clean; and I have
had an excellent dinner; and without being obsequious
or servile, which is not at all the characteristic of the
people in the North of Italy, the waiters are so amiably
disposed to invent little attentions which they suppose
to be English, and are so lighthearted and goodnatured,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_171" id="Page_2_171">[171]</a></span>
that it is a pleasure to have to do with them. But so
it is with all the people. Vetturino-travelling involves
a stoppage of two hours in the middle of the day, to
bait the horses. At that time I always walk on. If
there are many turns in the road, I necessarily have to
ask my way, very often: and the men are such gentlemen,
and the women such ladies, that it is quite an
interchange of courtesies."</p>

<p>Of the help his courier continued to be to him I had
whimsical instances in almost every letter, but he appears
too often in the published book to require such
celebration here. He is however an essential figure to
two little scenes sketched for me at Lodi, and I may
preface them by saying that Louis Roche, a native of
Avignon, justified to the close his master's high opinion.
He was again engaged for nearly a year in Switzerland,
and soon after, poor fellow, though with a jovial robustness
of look and breadth of chest that promised
unusual length of days, was killed by heart-disease.
"The brave C continues to be a prodigy. He puts out
my clothes at every inn as if I were going to stay there
twelve months; calls me to the instant every morning;
lights the fire before I get up; gets hold of roast fowls
and produces them in coaches at a distance from all
other help, in hungry moments; and is invaluable to
me. He is such a good fellow, too, that little rewards
don't spoil him. I always give him, after I have dined,
a tumbler of Sauterne or Hermitage or whatever I may
have; sometimes (as yesterday) when we have come to
a public-house at about eleven o'clock, very cold, having
started before day-break and had nothing, I make
him take his breakfast with me; and this renders him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_172" id="Page_2_172">[172]</a></span>
only more anxious than ever, by redoubling attentions,
to show me that he thinks he has got a good master .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I didn't tell you that the day before I left Genoa, we
had a dinner-party&mdash;our English consul and his wife;
the banker; Sir George Crawford and his wife; the
De la Rues; Mr. Curry; and some others, fourteen
in all. At about nine in the morning, two men in immense
paper caps enquired at the door for the brave
C, who presently introduced them in triumph as the
Governor's cooks, his private friends, who had come
to dress the dinner! Jane wouldn't stand this, however;
so we were obliged to decline. Then there came,
at half-hourly intervals, six gentlemen having the appearance
of English clergymen; other private friends
who had come to wait.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We accepted <i>their</i> services;
and you never saw anything so nicely and quietly done.
He had asked, as a special distinction, to be allowed
the supreme control of the dessert; and he had ices
made like fruit, had pieces of crockery turned upside
down so as to look like other pieces of crockery non-existent
in this part of Europe, and carried a case of
tooth-picks in his pocket. Then his delight was, to
get behind Kate at one end of the table, to look at
me at the other, and to say to Georgy in a low voice
whenever he handed her anything, 'What does master
think of datter 'rangement? Is he content?'&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
If you could see what these fellows of couriers are
when their families are not upon the move, you would
feel what a prize he is. I can't make out whether he
was ever a smuggler, but nothing will induce him
to give the custom-house-officers anything: in consequence
of which that portmanteau of mine has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_173" id="Page_2_173">[173]</a></span>
unnecessarily opened twenty times. Two of them will
come to the coach-door, at the gate of a town. 'Is
there anything contraband in this carriage, signore?'&mdash;'No,
no. There's nothing here. I am an Englishman,
and this is my servant.' 'A buono mano signore?'
'Roche,'(in English) 'give him something,
and get rid of him.' He sits unmoved. 'A buono
mano signore?' 'Go along with you!' says the brave
C. 'Signore, I am a custom-house-officer!' 'Well,
then, more shame for you!'&mdash;he always makes the
same answer. And then he turns to me and says in
English: while the custom-house-officer's face is a
portrait of anguish framed in the coach-window, from
his intense desire to know what is being told to his
disparagement: 'Datter chip,' shaking his fist at him,
'is greatest tief&mdash;and you know it you rascal&mdash;as never
did en-razh me so, that I cannot bear myself!' I
suppose chip to mean chap, but it may include the
custom-house-officer's father and have some reference
to the old block, for anything I distinctly know."</p>

<p>He closed his Lodi letter next day at Milan, whither
his wife and her sister had made an eighty miles journey
from Genoa, to pass a couple of days with him in
Prospero's old Dukedom before he left for London.
"We shall go our several ways on Thursday morning,
and I am still bent on appearing at Cuttris's on Sunday
the first, as if I had walked thither from Devonshire-terrace.
In the meantime I shall not write to
you again .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to enhance the pleasure (if anything
<i>can</i> enhance the pleasure) of our meeting .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am
opening my arms so wide!" One more letter I had
nevertheless; written at Strasburg on Monday night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_174" id="Page_2_174">[174]</a></span>
the 25th; to tell me I might look for him one day
earlier, so rapid had been his progress. He had been
in bed only once, at Friburg for two or three hours,
since he left Milan; and he had sledged through the
snow on the top of the Simplon in the midst of prodigious
cold. "I am sitting here <i>in</i> a wood-fire, and
drinking brandy and water scalding hot, with a faint
idea of coming warm in time. My face is at present
tingling with the frost and wind, as I suppose the
cymbals may, when that turbaned turk attached to the
life guards' band has been newly clashing at them in
St. James's-park. I am in hopes it may be the preliminary
agony of returning animation."</p>

<span class="caption">AT 58 LINCOLN&#39;S-INN-FIELDS, MONDAY THE 2ND OF DECEMBER 1844.</span>
</a></div>

<p>There was certainly no want of animation when we
met. I have but to write the words to bring back the
eager face and figure, as they flashed upon me so suddenly
this wintry Saturday night that almost before I
could be conscious of his presence I felt the grasp of
his hand. It is almost all I find it possible to remember
of the brief, bright, meeting. Hardly did he seem
to have come when he was gone. But all that the visit
proposed he accomplished. He saw his little book in
its final form for publication; and, to a select few
brought together on Monday the 2nd of December at
my house, had the opportunity of reading it aloud. An
occasion rather memorable, in which was the germ of
those readings to larger audiences by which, as much
as by his books, the world knew him in his later life;
but of which no detail beyond the fact remains in my
memory, and all are now dead who were present at it
excepting only Mr. Carlyle and myself. Among those
however who have thus passed away was one, our excellent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_175" id="Page_2_175">[175]</a></span>
Maclise, who, anticipating the advice of Captain
Cuttle, had "made a note of" it in pencil, which
I am able here to reproduce. It will tell the reader all
he can wish to know. He will see of whom the party
consisted; and may be assured (with allowance for a
touch of caricature to which I may claim to be considered
myself as the chief victim), that in the grave attention
of Carlyle, the eager interest of Stanfield and
Maclise, the keen look of poor Laman Blanchard, Fox's
rapt solemnity, Jerrold's skyward gaze, and the tears
of Harness and Dyce, the characteristic points of the
scene are sufficiently rendered. All other recollection
of it is passed and gone; but that at least its principal
actor was made glad and grateful, sufficient farther testimony
survives. Such was the report made of it, that
once more, on the pressing intercession of our friend
Thomas Ingoldsby (Mr. Barham), there was a second
reading to which the presence and enjoyment of Fonblanque
gave new zest;<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and when I expressed to
Dickens, after he left us, my grief that he had had so
tempestuous a journey for such brief enjoyment, he replied
that the visit had been one happiness and delight
to him. "I would not recall an inch of the way to or
from you, if it had been twenty times as long and
twenty thousand times as wintry. It was worth any
travel&mdash;anything! With the soil of the road in the
very grain of my cheeks, I swear I wouldn't have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_176" id="Page_2_176">[176]</a></span>
missed that week, that first night of our meeting, that
one evening of the reading at your rooms, aye, and the
second reading too, for any easily stated or conceived
consideration."</p>

<p>He wrote from Paris, at which he had stopped on his
way back to see Macready, whom an engagement to act
there with Mr. Mitchell's English company had prevented
from joining us in Lincoln's-inn-fields. There had been
no such frost and snow since 1829, and he gave dismal report
of the city. With Macready he had gone two nights
before to the Od&eacute;on to see Alexandre Dumas' <i>Christine</i>
played by Madame St. George, "once Napoleon's mistress;
now of an immense size, from dropsy I suppose;
and with little weak legs which she can't stand upon.
Her age, withal, somewhere about 80 or 90. I never
in my life beheld such a sight. Every stage-conventionality
she ever picked up (and she has them all)
has got the dropsy too, and is swollen and bloated
hideously. The other actors never looked at one another,
but delivered all their dialogues to the pit, in a
manner so egregiously unnatural and preposterous that
I couldn't make up my mind whether to take it as a
joke or an outrage." And then came allusion to a
project we had started on the night of the reading,
that a private play should be got up by us on his
return from Italy. "You and I, sir, will reform this
altogether." He had but to wait another night, however,
when he saw it all reformed at the Italian opera
where Grisi was singing in <i>Il Pirato</i>, and "the passion
and fire of a scene between her, Mario, and Fornasari,
was as good and great as it is possible for anything
operatic to be. They drew on one another, the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_177" id="Page_2_177">[177]</a></span>
men&mdash;not like stage-players, but like Macready himself:
and she, rushing in between them; now clinging to this
one, now to that, now making a sheath for their naked
swords with her arms, now tearing her hair in distraction
as they broke away from her and plunged again
at each other; was prodigious." This was the theatre
at which Macready was immediately to act, and where
Dickens saw him next day rehearse the scene before the
doge and council in <i>Othello</i>, "not as usual facing the
float but arranged on one side," with an effect that
seemed to him to heighten the reality of the scene.</p>

<p>He left Paris on the night of the 13th with the malle
poste, which did not reach Marseilles till fifteen hours
behind its time, after three days and three nights travelling
over horrible roads. Then, in a confusion between
the two rival packets for Genoa, he unwillingly detained
one of them more than an hour from sailing; and only
managed at last to get to her just as she was moving
out of harbour. As he went up the side, he saw a
strange sensation among the angry travellers whom he
had detained so long; heard a voice exclaim "I am
blarmed if it ain't <span class="smcap">Dickens</span>!" and stood in the centre
of a group of <i>Five Americans!</i> But the pleasantest
part of the story is that they were, one and all, glad
to see him; that their chief man, or leader, who had
met him in New York, at once introduced them all
round with the remark, "Personally our countrymen,
and you, can fix it friendly sir, I do expectuate;" and
that, through the stormy passage to Genoa which followed,
they were excellent friends. For the greater
part of the time, it is true, Dickens had to keep to his
cabin; but he contrived to get enjoyment out of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_178" id="Page_2_178">[178]</a></span>
nevertheless. The member of the party who had the
travelling dictionary wouldn't part with it, though he
was dead sick in the cabin next to my friend's; and
every now and then Dickens was conscious of his fellow-travellers
coming down to him, crying out in
varied tones of anxious bewilderment, "I say, what's
French for a pillow?" "Is there any Italian phrase
for a lump of sugar? Just look, will you?" "What
the devil does echo mean? The garsong says echo to
everything!" They were excessively curious to know,
too, the population of every little town on the Cornice,
and all its statistics; "perhaps the very last subjects
within the capacity of the human intellect," remarks
Dickens, "that would ever present themselves to an
Italian steward's mind. He was a very willing fellow,
our steward; and, having some vague idea that they
would like a large number, said at hazard fifty thousand,
ninety thousand, four hundred thousand, when they
asked about the population of a place not larger than
Lincoln's-inn-fields. And when they said <i>Non Possible!</i>
(which was the leader's invariable reply), he
doubled or trebled the amount; to meet what he supposed
to be their views, and make it quite satisfactory."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 22nd of December he had resumed his ordinary
Genoa life; and of a letter from Jeffrey, to
whom he had dedicated his little book, he wrote as
"most energetic and enthusiastic. Filer sticks in his
throat rather, but all the rest is quivering in his heart.
He is very much struck by the management of Lilian's
story, and cannot help speaking of that; writing of it
all indeed with the freshness and ardour of youth, and
not like a man whose blue and yellow has turned grey."
Some of its words have been already given. "Miss
Coutts has sent Charley, with the best of letters to me,
a Twelfth Cake weighing ninety pounds, magnificently
decorated; and only think of the characters, Fairburn's
Twelfth Night characters, being detained at the custom-house
for Jesuitical surveillance! But these fellows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_180" id="Page_2_180">[180]</a></span>
are&mdash;&mdash; Well! never mind. Perhaps you have seen
the history of the Dutch minister at Turin, and of the
spiriting away of his daughter by the Jesuits? It is all
true; though, like the history of our friend's servant,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
almost incredible. But their devilry is such that I am
assured by our consul that if, while we are in the south,
we were to let our children go out with servants on
whom we could not implicitly rely, these holy men
would trot even their small feet into churches with a
view to their ultimate conversion! It is tremendous
even to see them in the streets, or slinking about this
garden." Of his purpose to start for the south of Italy
in the middle of January, taking his wife with him, his
letter the following week told me; dwelling on all he
had missed, in that first Italian Christmas, of our old
enjoyments of the season in England; and closing its
pleasant talk with a postscript at midnight. "First of
January, 1845. Many many many happy returns of
the day! A life of happy years! The Baby is dressed
in thunder, lightning, rain, and wind. His birth is
most portentous here."</p>

<p>It was of ill-omen to me, one of its earliest incidents
being my only brother's death; but Dickens had a
friend's true helpfulness in sorrow, and a portion of
what he then wrote to me I permit myself to preserve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_181" id="Page_2_181">[181]</a></span>
in a note<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> for what it relates of his own sad experiences
and solemn beliefs and hopes. The journey southward
began on the 20th January, and five days later I had a
letter written from La Scala, at a little inn, "supported
on low brick arches like a British haystack," the bed
in their room "like a mangle," the ceiling without
lath or plaster, nothing to speak of available for comfort
or decency, and nothing particular to eat or drink.
"But for all this I have become attached to the country
and I don't care who knows it." They had left Pisa
that morning and Carrara the day before: at the latter
place an ovation awaiting him, the result of the zeal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_182" id="Page_2_182">[182]</a></span>
of our eccentric friend Fletcher, who happened to be
staying there with an English marble-merchant.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
"There is a beautiful little theatre there, built of marble;
and they had it illuminated that night, in my
honour. There was really a very fair opera: but it is
curious that the chorus has been always, time out of
mind, made up of labourers in the quarries, who don't
know a note of music, and sing entirely by ear. It was
crammed to excess, and I had a great reception; a
deputation waiting upon us in the box, and the orchestra
turning out in a body afterwards and serenading
us at Mr. Walton's." Between this and Rome they
had a somewhat wild journey;<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and before Radicofani
was reached, there were disturbing rumours of bandits
and even uncomfortable whispers as to their night's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_183" id="Page_2_183">[183]</a></span>
lodging-place. "I really began to think we might
have an adventure; and as I had brought (like an ass)
a bag of Napoleons with me from Genoa, I called up
all the theatrical ways of letting off pistols that I could
call to mind, and was the more disposed to fire them
from not having any." It ended in no worse adventure,
however, than a somewhat exciting dialogue
with an old professional beggar at Radicofani itself,
in which he was obliged to confess that he came off
second-best. It transpired at a little town hanging
on a hill side, of which the inhabitants, being all of
them beggars, had the habit of swooping down, like
so many birds of prey, upon any carriage that approached
it.</p>

<p>"Can you imagine" (he named a first-rate bore, for
whose name I shall substitute) "M. F. G. in a very
frowsy brown cloak concealing his whole figure, and
with very white hair and a very white beard, darting
out of this place with a long staff in his hand, and begging?
There he was, whether you can or not; out of
breath with the rapidity of his dive, and staying with
his staff all the Radicofani boys, that he might fight it
out with me alone. It was very wet, and so was I: for
I had kept, according to custom, my box-seat. It was
blowing so hard that I could scarcely stand; and there
was a custom-house on the spot, besides. Over and
above all this, I had no small money; and the brave C
never has, when I want it for a beggar. When I had
excused myself several times, he suddenly drew himself
up and said, with a wizard look (fancy the aggravation
of M. F. G. as a wizard!) 'Do you know what you
are doing, my lord? Do you mean to go on, to-day?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_184" id="Page_2_184">[184]</a></span>
'Yes,' I said, 'I do.' 'My lord,' he said, 'do you
know that your vetturino is unacquainted with this
part of the country; that there is a wind raging on the
mountain, which will sweep you away; that the courier,
the coach, and all the passengers, were blown from the
road last year; and that the danger is great and almost
certain?' 'No,' I said, 'I don't.' 'My lord, you
don't understand me, I think?' 'Yes I do, d&mdash;&mdash; you!'
nettled by this (you feel it? I confess it).
'Speak to my servant. It's his business. Not mine'&mdash;for
he really was too like M. F. G. to be borne. If
you could have seen him!&mdash;'Santa Maria, these
English lords! It's not their business, if they're
killed! They leave it to their servants!' He drew
off the boys; whispered them to keep away from the
heretic; and ran up the hill again, almost as fast as he
had come down. He stopped at a little distance as we
moved on; and pointing to Roche with his long staff
cried loudly after me, 'It's <i>his</i> business if you're killed,
is it, my lord? Ha! ha! ha! whose business is it,
when the English lords are born! Ha! ha! ha!' The
boys taking it up in a shrill yell, I left the joke and them
at this point. But I must confess that I thought he
had the best of it. And he had so far reason for what
he urged, that when we got on the mountain pass the
wind became terrific, so that we were obliged to take
Kate out of the carriage lest she should be blown over,
carriage and all, and had ourselves to hang on to it, on
the windy side, to prevent its going Heaven knows
where!"</p>

<p>The first impression of Rome was disappointing. It
was the evening of the 30th of January, and the cloudy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_185" id="Page_2_185">[185]</a></span>
sky, dull cold rain, and muddy footways, he was prepared
for; but he was not prepared for the long streets
of commonplace shops and houses like Paris or any
other capital, the busy people, the equipages, the ordinary
walkers up and down. "It was no more my Rome,
degraded and fallen and lying asleep in the sun among
a heap of ruins, than Lincoln's-inn-fields is. So I really
went to bed in a very indifferent humour." That all
this yielded to later and worthier impressions I need
hardly say; and he had never in his life, he told me
afterwards, been so moved or overcome by any sight
as by that of the Coliseum, "except perhaps by the
first contemplation of the Falls of Niagara." He went
to Naples for the interval before the holy week; and
his first letter from it was to say that he had found the
wonderful aspects of Rome before he left, and that for
loneliness and grandeur of ruin nothing could transcend
the southern side of the Campagna. But farther
and farther south the weather had become worse; and
for a week before his letter (the 11th of February), the
only bright sky he had seen was just as the sun was
coming up across the sea at Terracina. "Of which
place, a beautiful one, you can get a very good idea by
imagining something as totally unlike the scenery in
<i>Fra Diavolo</i> as possible." He thought the bay less
striking at Naples than at Genoa, the shape of the
latter being more perfect in its beauty, and the smaller
size enabling you to see it all at once, and feel it more
like an exquisite picture. The city he conceived the
greatest dislike to.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> "The condition of the common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_186" id="Page_2_186">[186]</a></span>
people here is abject and shocking. I am afraid the
conventional idea of the picturesque is associated with
such misery and degradation that a new picturesque
will have to be established as the world goes onward.
Except Fondi, there is nothing on earth that I have
seen so dirty as Naples. I don't know what to liken
the streets to where the mass of the lazzaroni live.
You recollect that favourite pigstye of mine near Broadstairs?
They are more like streets of such apartments
heaped up story on story, and tumbled house on house,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_187" id="Page_2_187">[187]</a></span>
than anything else I can think of, at this moment."
In a later letter he was even less tolerant. "What
would I give that you should see the lazzaroni as they
really are&mdash;mere squalid, abject, miserable animals for
vermin to batten on; slouching, slinking, ugly, shabby,
scavenging scarecrows! And oh the raffish counts and
more than doubtful countesses, the noodles and the
blacklegs, the good society! And oh the miles of
miserable streets and wretched occupants,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> to which
Saffron-hill or the Borough-mint is a kind of small
gentility, which are found to be so picturesque by
English lords and ladies; to whom the wretchedness
left behind at home is lowest of the low, and vilest
of the vile, and commonest of all common things.
Well! well! I have often thought that one of the
best chances of immortality for a writer is in the Death
of his language, when he immediately becomes good
company; and I often think here,&mdash;What <i>would</i> you
say to these people, milady and milord, if they spoke
out of the homely dictionary of your own 'lower
orders.'" He was again at Rome on Sunday the
second of March.</p>

<p>Sad news from me as to a common and very dear
friend awaited him there; but it is a subject on which
I may not dwell farther than to say that there arose
from it much to redeem even such a sorrow, and that
this I could not indicate better than by these wise and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_188" id="Page_2_188">[188]</a></span>
tender words from Dickens. "No philosophy will
bear these dreadful things, or make a moment's head
against them, but the practical one of doing all the
good we can, in thought and deed. While we can,
God help us! ourselves stray from ourselves so easily;
and there are all around us such frightful calamities
besetting the world in which we live; nothing else will
carry us through it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What a comfort to reflect on
what you tell me. Bulwer Lytton's conduct is that
of a generous and noble-minded man, as I have ever
thought him. Our dear good Procter too! And
Thackeray&mdash;how earnest they have all been! I am
very glad to find you making special mention of
Charles Lever. I am glad over every name you write.
It says something for our pursuit, in the midst of all
its miserable disputes and jealousies, that the common
impulse of its followers, in such an instance as this,
is surely and certainly of the noblest."</p>

<p>After the ceremonies of the holy week, of which the
descriptions sent to me were reproduced in his book,
he went to Florence,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> which lived always afterwards in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_189" id="Page_2_189">[189]</a></span>
his memory with Venice, and with Genoa. He
thought these the three great Italian cities. "There
are some places here,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>&mdash;oh Heaven how fine! I wish
you could see the tower of the palazzo Vecchio as it
lies before me at this moment, on the opposite bank of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_190" id="Page_2_190">[190]</a></span>
the Arno! But I will tell you more about it, and
about all Florence, from my shady arm-chair up among
the Peschiere oranges. I shall not be sorry to sit down
in it again.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Poor Hood, poor Hood! I still look
for his death, and he still lingers on. And Sydney
Smith's brother gone after poor dear Sydney himself!
Maltby will wither when he reads it; and poor old
Rogers will contradict some young man at dinner,
every day for three weeks."</p>

<p>Before he left Florence (on the 4th of April) I heard
of a "very pleasant and very merry day" at Lord
Holland's; and I ought to have mentioned how much
he was gratified, at Naples, by the attentions of the
English Minister there, Mr. Temple, Lord Palmerston's
brother, whom he described as a man supremely
agreeable, with everything about him in perfect taste,
and with that truest gentleman-manner which has its
root in kindness and generosity of nature. He was
back at home in the Peschiere on Wednesday the ninth
of April. Here he continued to write to me every
week, for as long as he remained, of whatever he had
seen: with no definite purpose as yet, but the pleasure
of interchanging with myself the impressions and
emotions undergone by him. "Seriously," he wrote
to me on the 13th of April, "it is a great pleasure to
me to find that you are really pleased with these
shadows in the water, and think them worth the looking
at. Writing at such odd places, and in such odd
seasons, I have been half savage with myself, very
often, for not doing better. But d'Orsay, from whom
I had a charming letter three days since, seems to
think as you do of what he has read in those shown to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_191" id="Page_2_191">[191]</a></span>
him, and says they remind him vividly of the real
aspect of these scenes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, if we should determine,
after we have sat in council, that the experiences
they relate are to be used, we will call B. and E. to
their share and voice in the matter." Shortly before
he left, the subject was again referred to (7th of June).
"I am in as great doubt as you about the letters I have
written you with these Italian experiences. I cannot
for the life of me devise any plan of using them to my
own satisfaction, and yet think entirely with you
that in some form I ought to use them." Circumstances
not in his contemplation at this time settled
the form they ultimately took.</p>

<p>Two more months were to finish his Italian holiday,
and I do not think he enjoyed any part of it so much
as its close. He had formed a real friendship for
Genoa, was greatly attached to the social circle he had
drawn round him there, and liked rest after his travel
all the more for the little excitement of living its activities
over again, week by week, in these letters to
me. And so, from his "shady arm-chair up among
the Peschiere oranges," I had at regular intervals what
he called his rambling talk; went over with him again
all the roads he had taken; and of the more important
scenes and cities, such as Venice, Rome, and Naples,
received such rich filling-in to the first outlines sent, as
fairly justified the title of <i>Pictures</i> finally chosen for
them. The weather all the time too had been without
a flaw. "Since our return," he wrote on the 27th
April, "we have had charming spring days. The
garden is one grove of roses; we have left off fires;
and we breakfast and dine again in the great hall, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_192" id="Page_2_192">[192]</a></span>
the windows open. To-day we have rain, but rain was
rather wanted I believe, so it gives offence to nobody.
As far as I have had an opportunity of judging yet, the
spring is the most delightful time in this country. But
for all that I am looking with eagerness to the tenth of
June, impatient to renew our happy old walks and old
talks in dear old home."</p>

<p>Of incidents during these remaining weeks there
were few, but such as he mentioned had in them
points of humour or character still worth remembering.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
Two men were hanged in the city; and two ladies of
quality, he told me, agreed to keep up for a time a
prayer for the souls of these two miserable creatures so
incessant that Heaven should never for a moment be left
alone; to which end "they relieved each other" after such
wise, that, for the whole of the stated time, one of them
was always on her knees in the cathedral church of
San Lorenzo. From which he inferred that "a morbid
sympathy for criminals is not wholly peculiar to England,
though it affects more people in that country perhaps
than in any other."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_193" id="Page_2_193">[193]</a></span></p>
<p>Of Italian usages to the dead some notices from his
letters have been given, and he had an example before
he left of the way in which they affected English residents.
A gentleman of his friend Fletcher's acquaintance
living four miles from Genoa had the misfortune
to lose his wife; and no attendance on the dead beyond
the city gate, nor even any decent conveyance,
being practicable, the mourner, to whom Fletcher had
promised nevertheless the sad satisfaction of an English
funeral, which he had meanwhile taken enormous secret
pains to arrange with a small Genoese upholsterer, was
waited upon, on the appointed morning, by a very
bright yellow hackney-coach-and-pair driven by a
coachman in yet brighter scarlet knee-breeches and
waistcoat, who wanted to put the husband and the
body inside together. "They were obliged to leave
one of the coach-doors open for the accommodation
even of the coffin; the widower walked beside the
carriage to the Protestant cemetery; and Fletcher followed
on a big grey horse."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_194" id="Page_2_194">[194]</a></span></p>
<p>Scarlet breeches reappear, not less characteristically,
in what his next letter told of a couple of English
travellers who took possession at this time (24th of
May) of a portion of the ground floor of the Peschiere.
They had with them a meek English footman who immediately
confided to Dickens's servants, among other
personal grievances, the fact that he was made to do
everything, even cooking, in crimson breeches; which
in a hot climate, he protested, was "a grinding of him
down." "He is a poor soft country fellow; and his
master locks him up at night, in a basement room with
iron bars to the window. Between which our servants
poke wine in, at midnight. His master and mistress
buy old boxes at the curiosity shops, and pass their
lives in lining 'em with bits of parti-coloured velvet.
A droll existence, is it not? We are lucky to have had
the palace to ourselves until now, but it is so large that
we never see or hear these people; and I should not
have known even, if they had not called upon us, that
another portion of the ground floor had been taken by
some friends of old Lady Holland&mdash;whom I seem to
see again, crying about dear Sydney Smith, behind
that green screen as we last saw her together."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_195" id="Page_2_195">[195]</a></span></p>
<p>Then came a little incident also characteristic. An
English ship of war, the Phantom, appeared in the harbour;
and from her commander, Sir Henry Nicholson,
Dickens received, among attentions very pleasant to
him, an invitation to lunch on board and bring his
wife, for whom, at a time appointed, a boat was to be
sent to the Ponte Reale (the royal bridge). But no
boat being there at the time, Dickens sent off his servant
in another boat to the ship to say he feared some
mistake. "While we were walking up and down a
neighbouring piazza in his absence, a brilliant fellow in
a dark blue shirt with a white hem to it all round the
collar, regular corkscrew curls, and a face as brown as
a berry, comes up to me and says 'Beg your pardon sir&mdash;Mr.
Dickens?' 'Yes.' 'Beg your pardon sir, but
I'm one of the ship's company of the Phantom sir,
cox'en of the cap'en's gig sir, she's a lying off the pint
sir&mdash;been there half an hour.' 'Well but my good fellow,'
I said, 'you're at the wrong place!' 'Beg your
pardon sir, I was afeerd it was the wrong place sir, but
I've asked them Genoese here sir, twenty times, if it
was Port Real; and they knows no more than a dead
jackass!'&mdash;Isn't it a good thing to have made a regular
Portsmouth name of it?"</p>

<p>That was in his letter of the 1st June, which began
by telling me it had been twice begun and twice flung
into the basket, so great was his indisposition to write
as the time for departure came; and which ended thus.
"The fire-flies at night now, are miraculously splendid;
making another firmament among the rocks on the seashore,
and the vines inland. They get into the bedrooms,
and fly about, all night, like beautiful little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_196" id="Page_2_196">[196]</a></span>
lamps.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have surrendered much I had fixed my
heart upon, as you know, admitting you have had reason
for not coming to us here: but I stand by the hope
that you and Mac will come and meet us at Brussels; it
being so very easy. A day or two there, and at Antwerp,
would be very happy for us; and we could still
dine in Lincoln's-inn-fields on the day of arrival." I
had been unable to join him in Genoa, urgently as he
had wished it: but what is said here was done, and
Jerrold was added to the party.</p>

<p>His last letter from Genoa was written on the 7th of
June, not from the Peschiere, but from a neighbouring
palace, "Brignole Rosso," into which he had fled from
the miseries of moving. "They are all at sixes and sevens
up at the Peschiere, as you may suppose; and Roche is
in a condition of tremendous excitement, engaged in
settling the inventory with the house-agent, who has
just told me he is the devil himself. I had been appealed
to, and had contented myself with this expression
of opinion. 'Signor Noli, you are an old impostor!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_197" id="Page_2_197">[197]</a></span>
'Illustrissimo,' said Signor Noli in reply,
'your servant is the devil himself: sent on earth to
torture me.' I look occasionally towards the Peschiere
(it is visible from this room), expecting to see one of
them flying out of a window. Another great cause of
commotion is, that they have been paving the lane by
which the house is approached, ever since we returned
from Rome. We have not been able to get the carriage
up since that time, in consequence; and unless
they finish to-night, it can't be packed in the garden,
but the things will have to be brought down in baskets,
piecemeal, and packed in the street. To avoid this
inconvenient necessity, the Brave made proposals of
bribery to the paviours last night, and induced them
to pledge themselves that the carriage should come up at
seven this evening. The manner of doing that sort of
paving work here, is to take a pick or two with an axe,
and then lie down to sleep for an hour. When I came
out, the Brave had issued forth to examine the ground;
and was standing alone in the sun among a heap of
prostrate figures: with a Great Despair depicted in his
face, which it would be hard to surpass. It was like a
picture&mdash;'After the Battle'&mdash;Napoleon by the Brave:
Bodies by the Paviours."</p>

<p>He came home by the Great St. Gothard, and was
quite carried away by what he saw of Switzerland. The
country was so divine that he should have wondered
indeed if its sons and daughters had ever been other
than a patriotic people. Yet, infinitely above the
country he had left as he ranked it in its natural splendours,
there was something more enchanting than these
that he lost in leaving Italy; and he expressed this delightfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_198" id="Page_2_198">[198]</a></span>
in the letter from Lucerne (14th of June)
which closes the narrative of his Italian life.</p>

<p>"We came over the St. Gothard, which has been
open only eight days. The road is cut through the
snow, and the carriage winds along a narrow path between
two massive snow walls, twenty feet high or
more. Vast plains of snow range up the mountain-sides
above the road, itself seven thousand feet above
the sea; and tremendous waterfalls, hewing out arches
for themselves in the vast drifts, go thundering down
from precipices into deep chasms, here and there and
everywhere: the blue water tearing through the white
snow with an awful beauty that is most sublime. The
pass itself, the mere pass over the top, is not so fine, I
think, as the Simplon; and there is no plain upon the
summit, for the moment it is reached the descent begins.
So that the loneliness and wildness of the Simplon
are not equalled <i>there</i>. But being much higher,
the ascent and the descent range over a much greater
space of country; and on both sides there are places
of terrible grandeur, unsurpassable, I should imagine,
in the world. The Devil's Bridge, terrific! The
whole descent between Andermatt (where we slept on
Friday night) and Altdorf, William Tell's town, which
we passed through yesterday afternoon, is the highest
sublimation of all you can imagine in the way of Swiss
scenery. Oh God! what a beautiful country it is!
How poor and shrunken, beside it, is Italy in its
brightest aspect!</p>

<p>"I look upon the coming down from the Great St.
Gothard with a carriage and four horses and only one
postilion, as the most dangerous thing that a carriage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_199" id="Page_2_199">[199]</a></span>
and horses can do. We had two great wooden logs for
drags, and snapped them both like matches. The road
is like a geometrical staircase, with horrible depths
beneath it; and at every turn it is a toss-up, or seems
to be, whether the leaders shall go round or over. The
lives of the whole party may depend upon a strap in
the harness; and if we broke our rotten harness once
yesterday, we broke it at least a dozen times. The difficulty
of keeping the horses together in the continual
and steep circle, is immense. They slip and slide, and
get their legs over the traces, and are dragged up
against the rocks; carriage, horses, harness, all a confused
heap. The Brave, and I, and the postilion, were
constantly at work, in extricating the whole concern
from a tangle, like a skein of thread. We broke two
thick iron chains, and crushed the box of a wheel, as it
was; and the carriage is now undergoing repair, under
the window, on the margin of the lake: where a woman
in short petticoats, a stomacher, and two immensely
long tails of black hair hanging down her back very
nearly to her heels, is looking on&mdash;apparently dressed
for a melodrama, but in reality a waitress at this establishment.</p>

<p>"If the Swiss villages look beautiful to me in winter,
their summer aspect is most charming: most fascinating:
most delicious. Shut in by high mountains capped
with perpetual snow; and dotting a rich carpet of the
softest turf, overshadowed by great trees; they seem so
many little havens of refuge from the troubles and
miseries of great towns. The cleanliness of the little
baby-houses of inns is wonderful to those who come
from Italy. But the beautiful Italian manners, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_200" id="Page_2_200">[200]</a></span>
sweet language, the quick recognition of a pleasant
look or cheerful word; the captivating expression of a

Remembering them, I sigh for the dirt again: the brick

the travellers; passed a delightful week in Flanders
together; and were in England at the close of June.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">His</span> first letter after again taking possession of Devonshire-terrace
revived a subject on which opinions
had been from time to time interchanged during his
absence, and to which there was allusion in the agreement
executed before his departure. The desire was
still as strong with him as when he started <i>Master Humphrey's
Clock</i> to establish a periodical, that, while relieving
his own pen by enabling him to receive frequent
help from other writers, might yet retain always the
popularity of his name. "I really think I have an idea,
and not a bad one, for the periodical. I have turned
it over, the last two days, very much in my mind: and
think it positively good. I incline still to weekly;
price three halfpence, if possible; partly original,
partly select; notices of books, notices of theatres,
notices of all good things, notices of all bad ones;
<i>Carol</i> philosophy, cheerful views, sharp anatomization
of humbug, jolly good temper; papers always in season,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_202" id="Page_2_202">[202]</a></span>
pat to the time of year; and a vein of glowing, hearty,
generous, mirthful, beaming reference in everything to
Home, and Fireside. And I would call it, sir,&mdash;</p>

<div class='bbox'>
<div class='center'>THE CRICKET.<br />
<br />
A cheerful creature that chirrups on the Hearth.<br /></div>

<div class='sig'><br />
<i>Natural History.</i><br /></div>
</div>

<p>"Now, don't decide hastily till you've heard what I
would do. I would come out, sir, with a prospectus
on the subject of the Cricket that should put everybody
in a good temper, and make such a dash at
people's fenders and arm-chairs as hasn't been made
for many a long day. I could approach them in a
different mode under this name, and in a more winning
and immediate way, than under any other. I
would at once sit down upon their very hobs; and
take a personal and confidential position with them
which should separate me, instantly, from all other
periodicals periodically published, and supply a distinct
and sufficient reason for my coming into existence.
And I would chirp, chirp, chirp away in every number
until I chirped it up to&mdash;&mdash;well, you shall say how many
hundred thousand!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Seriously, I feel a capacity in
this name and notion which appears to give us a tangible
starting-point, and a real, defined, strong, genial drift
and purpose. I seem to feel that it is an aim and name
which people would readily and pleasantly connect with
<i>me;</i> and that, for a good course and a clear one, instead
of making circles pigeon-like at starting, here we should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_203" id="Page_2_203">[203]</a></span>
be safe. I think the general recognition would be
likely to leap at it; and of the helpful associations
that could be clustered round the idea at starting,
and the pleasant tone of which the working of it is
susceptible, I have not the smallest doubt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But you
shall determine. What do you think? And what do
you say? The chances are, that it will either strike
you instantly, or not strike you at all. Which is it, my
dear fellow? You know I am not bigoted to the first
suggestions of my own fancy; but you know also exactly
how I should use such a lever, and how much
power I should find in it. Which is it? What do you
say?&mdash;I have not myself said half enough. Indeed I
have said next to nothing; but like the parrot in the
negro-story, I 'think a dam deal.'"</p>

<p>My objection, incident more or less to every such
scheme, was the risk of losing its general advantage
by making it too specially dependent on individual
characteristics; but there was much in favour of the
present notion, and its plan had been modified so far,
in the discussions that followed, as to involve less
absolute personal identification with Dickens,&mdash;when
discussion, project, everything was swept away by a
larger scheme, in its extent and its danger more suitable
to the wild and hazardous enterprises of that prodigious
year (1845) of excitement and disaster. In this more
tremendous adventure, already hinted at on a previous
page, we all became involved; and the chirp of the
Cricket, delayed in consequence until Christmas, was
heard then in circumstances quite other than those that
were first intended. The change he thus announced
to me about half way through the summer, in the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_204" id="Page_2_204">[204]</a></span>
letter which told me the success of d'Orsay's kind
exertion to procure a fresh engagement for his courier
Roche.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> "What do you think of a notion that has
occurred to me in connection with our abandoned little
weekly? It would be a delicate and beautiful fancy
for a Christmas book, making the Cricket a little
household god&mdash;silent in the wrong and sorrow of the
tale, and loud again when all went well and happy."
The reader will not need to be told that thus originated
the story of the <i>Cricket on the Hearth</i>, a Fairy Tale of
Home, which had a great popularity in the Christmas
days of 1845. Its sale at the outset doubled that of
both its predecessors.</p>

<p>But as yet the larger adventure has not made itself
known, and the interval was occupied with the private
play of which the notion had been started between us
at his visit in December, and which cannot now be
better introduced than by a passage of autobiography.
This belongs to his early life, but I overlooked it when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_205" id="Page_2_205">[205]</a></span>
engaged on that portion of the memoir; and the
accident gives it now a more appropriate place. For,
though the facts related belong to the interval described
in the chapter on his school-days and start in life,
when he had to pass nearly two years as a reporter for
one of the offices in Doctors' Commons, the influences
and character it illustrates had their strongest expression
at this later time. I had asked him, after his
return to Genoa, whether he continued to think that
we should have the play; and this was his reply. It
will startle and interest the reader, and I must confess
that it took myself by surprise; for I did not thus early
know the story of his boyish years, and I thought it
strange that he could have concealed from me so much.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Are</span> we to have that play??? Have I spoken of
it, ever since I came home from London, as a settled
thing! I do not know if I have ever told you seriously,
but I have often thought, that I should certainly
have been as successful on the boards as I have been
between them. I assure you, when I was on the stage
at Montreal (not having played for years) I was as
much astonished at the reality and ease, to myself, of
what I did as if I had been another man. See how
oddly things come about! When I was about twenty,
and knew three or four successive years of Mathews's
At Homes from sitting in the pit to hear them, I wrote
to Bartley who was stage manager at Covent-garden,
and told him how young I was, and exactly what I
thought I could do; and that I believed I had a strong
perception of character and oddity, and a natural
power of reproducing in my own person what I observed
in others. There must have been something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_206" id="Page_2_206">[206]</a></span>
in the letter that struck the authorities, for Bartley
wrote to me, almost immediately, to say that they were
busy getting up the <i>Hunchback</i> (so they were!) but
that they would communicate with me again, in a
fortnight. Punctual to the time, another letter came:
with an appointment to do anything of Mathews's I
pleased, before him and Charles Kemble, on a certain
day at the theatre. My sister Fanny was in the secret,
and was to go with me to play the songs. I was laid
up, when the day came, with a terrible bad cold and
an inflammation of the face; the beginning, by the
bye, of that annoyance in one ear to which I am
subject at this day. I wrote to say so, and added that
I would resume my application next season. I made
a great splash in the gallery soon afterwards; the
<i>Chronicle</i> opened to me; I had a distinction in the
little world of the newspaper, which made me like it;
began to write; didn't want money; had never thought
of the stage, but as a means of getting it; gradually
left off turning my thoughts that way; and never resumed
the idea. I never told you this, did I? See
how near I may have been, to another sort of life.</p>

<p>"This was at the time when I was at Doctors' Commons
as a shorthand writer for the proctors. And I
recollect I wrote the letter from a little office I had
there, where the answer came also. It wasn't a very
good living (though not a <i>very</i> bad one), and was
wearily uncertain; which made me think of the Theatre
in quite a business-like way. I went to some
theatre every night, with a very few exceptions, for at
least three years: really studying the bills first, and
going to where there was the best acting: and always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_207" id="Page_2_207">[207]</a></span>
to see Mathews whenever he played. I practised immensely
(even such things as walking in and out, and
sitting down in a chair): often four, five, six hours a
day: shut up in my own room, or walking about in
the fields. I prescribed to myself, too, a sort of
Hamiltonian system for learning parts; and learnt a
great number. I haven't even lost the habit now, for
I knew my Canadian parts immediately, though they
were new to me. I must have done a good deal: for,
just as Macready found me out, they used to challenge
me at Braham's: and Yates, who was knowing enough
in those things, wasn't to be parried at all. It was
just the same, that day at Keeley's, when they were
getting up the <i>Chuzzlewit</i> last June.</p>

<p>"If you think Macready would be interested in this
Strange news from the South, tell it him. Fancy
Bartley or Charles Kemble <i>now!</i> And how little they
suspect me!" In the later letter from Lucerne written
as he was travelling home, he adds: "<i>Did</i> I ever tell
you the details of my theatrical idea, before? Strange,
that I should have quite forgotten it. I had an odd
fancy, when I was reading the unfortunate little farce
at Covent-garden, that Bartley looked as if some
struggling recollection and connection were stirring up
within him&mdash;but it may only have been his doubts of
that humorous composition." The last allusion is to
the farce of the <i>Lamplighter</i> which he read in the Covent-garden
green-room, and to which former allusion
was made in speaking of his wish to give help to Macready's
managerial enterprise.</p>

<p><i>What Might have Been</i> is a history of too little profit
to be worth anybody's writing, and here there is no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_208" id="Page_2_208">[208]</a></span>
call even to regret how great an actor was in Dickens
lost. He took to a higher calling, but it included the
lower. There was no character created by him into
which life and reality were not thrown with such vividness,
that the thing written did not seem to his readers
the thing actually done, whether the form of disguise
put on by the enchanter was Mrs. Gamp, Tom Pinch,
Mr. Squeers, or Fagin the Jew. He had the power of
projecting himself into shapes and suggestions of his
fancy which is one of the marvels of creative imagination,
and what he desired to express he became. The
assumptions of the theatre have the same method at a
lower pitch, depending greatly on personal accident;
but the accident as much as the genius favoured Dickens,
and another man's conception underwent in his
acting the process which in writing he applied to his
own. Into both he flung himself with the passionate
fullness of his nature; and though the theatre had
limits for him that may be named hereafter, and he
was always greater in quickness of assumption than in
steadiness of delineation, there was no limit to his delight
and enjoyment in the adventures of our theatrical
holiday.</p>

<p>In less than three weeks after his return we had
selected our play, cast our parts, and all but engaged
our theatre; as I find by a note from my friend of the
22nd of July, in which the good natured laugh can
give now no offence, since all who might have objected
to it have long gone from us. Fanny Kelly, the friend
of Charles Lamb, and a genuine successor to the old
school of actresses in which the Mrs. Orgers and Miss
Popes were bred, was not more delightful on the stage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_209" id="Page_2_209">[209]</a></span>
than impracticable when off, and the little theatre in
Dean-street which the Duke of Devonshire's munificence
had enabled her to build, and which with any
ordinary good sense might handsomely have realized
both its uses, as a private school for young actresses
and a place of public amusement, was made useless for
both by her mere whims and fancies. "Heavens!
Such a scene as I have had with Miss Kelly here,
this morning! She wanted us put off until the theatre
should be cleaned and brushed up a bit, and she
would and she would not, for she is eager to have us
and alarmed when she thinks of us. By the foot of
Pharaoh, it was a great scene! Especially when she
choked, and had the glass of water brought. She exaggerates
the importance of our occupation, dreads
the least prejudice against the establishment in the
minds of any of our company, says the place already
has quite ruined her, and with tears in her eyes protests
that any jokes at her additional expense in print would
drive her mad. By the body of C&aelig;sar, the scene was
incredible! It's like a preposterous dream." Something
of our play is disclosed by the oaths &agrave; la Bobadil,
and of our actors by "the jokes" poor Miss Kelly was
afraid of. We had chosen <span class="smcap">Every Man in his Humour</span>,
with special regard to the singleness and individuality
of the "humours" portrayed in it; and our company
included the leaders of a journal then in its earliest
years, but already not more renowned as the most successful
joker of jokes yet known in England, than famous
for that exclusive use of its laughter and satire for objects
the highest or most harmless which makes it still so
enjoyable a companion to mirth-loving right-minded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_210" id="Page_2_210">[210]</a></span>
men. Maclise took earnest part with us, and was to have
acted, but fell away on the eve of the rehearsals; and
Stanfield, who went so far as to rehearse Downright
twice, then took fright and also ran away:<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> but Jerrold,
who played Master Stephen, brought with him Lemon,
who took Brainworm; Leech, to whom Master Matthew
was given; A'Beckett, who had condescended to the
small part of William; and Mr. Leigh, who had Oliver
Cob. I played Kitely, and Bobadil fell to Dickens,
who took upon him the redoubtable Captain long before
he stood in his dress at the footlights; humouring the
completeness of his assumption by talking and writing
Bobadil, till the dullest of our party were touched and
stirred to something of his own heartiness of enjoyment.
One or two hints of these have been given, and I will
only add to them his refusal of my wish that he should
go and see some special performance of the Gamester.
"Man of the House. <i>Gamester!</i> By the foot of Pharaoh,
I will <i>not</i> see the <i>Gamester</i>. Man shall not force,
nor horses drag, this poor gentleman-like carcass into
the presence of the <i>Gamester</i>. I have said it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The player Mac hath bidden me to eat and likewise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_211" id="Page_2_211">[211]</a></span>
drink with him, thyself, and short-necked Fox to-night&mdash;An'
I go not, I am a hog, and not a soldier. But an'
thou goest not&mdash;Beware citizen! Look to it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Thine as thou meritest. <span class="smcap">Bobadil</span> (Captain). Unto
Master Kitely. These."</p>

<p>The play was played on the 21st of September with
a success that out-ran the wildest expectation; and
turned our little enterprise into one of the small sensations
of the day. The applause of the theatre found
so loud an echo in the press, that for the time nothing
else was talked about in private circles; and after a
week or two we had to yield (we did not find it difficult)
to a pressure of demand for more public performance
in a larger theatre, by which a useful charity received
important help, and its committee showed their
gratitude by an entertainment to us at the Clarendon,
a month or two later, when Lord Lansdowne took the
chair. There was also another performance by us at
the same theatre, before the close of the year, of a
play by Beaumont and Fletcher. I may not farther
indicate the enjoyments that attended the success, and
gave always to the first of our series of performances a
pre-eminently pleasant place in memory.</p>

<p>Of the thing itself, however, it is necessary to be
said that a modicum of merit goes a long way in all
such matters, and it would not be safe now to assume
that ours was much above the average of amateur attempts
in general. Lemon certainly had most of the
stuff, conventional as well as otherwise, of a regular
actor in him, but this was not of a high kind; and
though Dickens had the title to be called a born comedian,
the turn for it being in his very nature, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_212" id="Page_2_212">[212]</a></span>
strength was rather in the vividness and variety of his
assumptions, than in the completeness, finish, or ideality
he could give to any part of them. It is expressed exactly
by what he says of his youthful preference for the
representations of the elder Mathews. At the same
time this was in itself so thoroughly genuine and enjoyable,
and had in it such quickness and keenness of insight,
that of its kind it was unrivalled; and it enabled
him to present in Bobadil, after a richly coloured
picture of bombastical extravagance and comic exaltation
in the earlier scenes, a contrast in the later of
tragical humility and abasement, that had a wonderful
effect. But greatly as his acting contributed to the
success of the night, this was nothing to the service he
had rendered as manager. It would be difficult to describe
it. He was the life and soul of the entire affair.
I never seemed till then to have known his business
capabilities. He took everything on himself, and did
the whole of it without an effort. He was stage-director,
very often stage-carpenter, scene-arranger, property-man,
prompter, and band-master. Without offending
any one he kept every one in order. For all he had
useful suggestions, and the dullest of clays under his
potter's hand were transformed into little bits of porcelain.
He adjusted scenes, assisted carpenters, invented
costumes, devised playbills, wrote out calls, and enforced
as well as exhibited in his proper person everything
of which he urged the necessity on others. Such
a chaos of dirt, confusion, and noise, as the little
theatre was the day we entered it, and such a cosmos
as he made it of cleanliness, order, and silence, before
the rehearsals were over! There were only two things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_213" id="Page_2_213">[213]</a></span>
left as we found them, bits of humanity both, understood
from the first as among the fixtures of the place:
a Man in a Straw Hat, tall, and very fitful in his exits
and entrances, of whom we never could pierce the
mystery, whether he was on guard or in possession, or
what he was; and a solitary little girl, who flitted about
so silently among our actors and actresses that she
might have been deaf and dumb but for sudden small
shrieks and starts elicited by the wonders going on,
which obtained for her the name of Fireworks. There
is such humorous allusion to both in a letter of Dickens's
of a year's later date, on the occasion of the straw-hatted
mystery revealing itself as a gentleman in training
for the tragic stage, that it may pleasantly close for
the present our private theatricals.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Our straw-hatted friend</span> from Miss Kelly's!
Oh my stars! To think of him, all that time&mdash;Macbeth
in disguise; Richard the Third grown straight;
Hamlet as he appeared on his seavoyage to England.
What an artful villain he must be, never to have made
any sign of the melodrama that was in him! What a
wicked-minded and remorseless Iago to have seen you
doing Kitely night after night! raging to murder you
and seize the part! Oh fancy Miss Kelly 'getting him
up' in Macbeth. Good Heaven! what a mass of absurdity
must be shut up sometimes within the walls of
that small theatre in Dean-street! <span class="smcap">Fireworks</span> will
come out shortly, depend upon it, in the dumb line;
and will relate her history in profoundly unintelligible
motions that will be translated into long and complicated
descriptions by a grey-headed father, and a red-wigged
countryman, his son. You remember the dumb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_214" id="Page_2_214">[214]</a></span>
dodge of relating an escape from captivity? Clasping
the left wrist with the right hand, and the right wrist
with the left hand&mdash;alternately (to express chains)&mdash;and
then going round and round the stage very fast,
and coming hand over hand down an imaginary cord;
at the end of which there is one stroke on the drum,
and a kneeling to the chandelier? If Fireworks can't
do that&mdash;and won't somewhere&mdash;I'm a Dutchman."</p>

<p>Graver things now claim a notice which need not be
proportioned to their gravity, because, though they
had an immediate effect on Dickens's fortunes, they
do not otherwise form part of his story. But first let
me say, he was at Broadstairs for three weeks in the
autumn;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> we had the private play on his return; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_215" id="Page_2_215">[215]</a></span>
a month later, on the 28th of October, a sixth child
and fourth son, named Alfred Tennyson after his godfathers
d'Orsay and Tennyson, was born in Devonshire-terrace.
A death in the family followed, the older and
more gifted of his ravens having indulged the same
illicit taste for putty and paint which had been fatal
to his predecessor. Voracity killed him, as it killed
Scott's. He died unexpectedly before the kitchen-fire.
"He kept his eye to the last upon the meat as it roasted,
and suddenly turned over on his back with a sepulchral
cry of <i>Cuckoo!</i>" The letter which told me this (31st
of October) announced to me also that he was at a
dead lock in his Christmas story: "Sick, bothered and
depressed. Visions of Brighton come upon me; and
I have a great mind to go there to finish my second
part, or to Hampstead. I have a desperate thought of
Jack Straw's. I never was in such bad writing cue as
I am this week, in all my life." The reason was not
far to seek. In the preparation for the proposed new
Daily Paper to which reference has been made, he was
now actively assisting, and had all but consented to the
publication of his name.</p>

<p>I entertained at this time, for more than one powerful
reason, the greatest misgiving of his intended share
in the adventure. It was not fully revealed until later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_216" id="Page_2_216">[216]</a></span>
on what difficult terms, physical as well as mental,
Dickens held the tenure of his imaginative life; but
already I knew enough to doubt the wisdom of what he
was at present undertaking. In all intellectual labour,
his will prevailed so strongly when he fixed it on any
object of desire, that what else its attainment might
exact was never duly measured; and this led to frequent
strain and unconscious waste of what no man could less
afford to spare. To the world gladdened by his work,
its production might always have seemed quite as easy
as its enjoyment; but it may be doubted if ever any
man's mental effort cost him more. His habits were
robust, but not his health; that secret had been disclosed
to me before he went to America; and to the
last he refused steadily to admit the enormous price he
had paid for his triumphs and successes. The morning
after his last note I heard again. "I have been so very
unwell this morning, with giddiness, and headache, and
botheration of one sort or other, that I didn't get up
till noon: and, shunning Fleet-street" (the office of the
proposed new paper), "am now going for a country
walk, in the course of which you will find me, if you
feel disposed to come away in the carriage that goes to
you with this. It is to call for a pull of the first part
of the <i>Cricket</i>, and will bring you, if you like, by way
of Hampstead to me, and subsequently to dinner. There
is much I should like to discuss, if you can manage it.
It's the loss of my walks, I suppose; but I am as giddy
as if I were drunk, and can hardly see." I gave far
from sufficient importance at the time to the frequency
of complaints of this kind, or to the recurrence, at
almost regular periods after the year following the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_217" id="Page_2_217">[217]</a></span>
present, of those spasms in the side of which he has
recorded an instance in the recollections of his childhood,
and of which he had an attack in Genoa; but
though not conscious of it to its full extent, this consideration
was among those that influenced me in a determination
to endeavour to turn him from what could
not but be regarded as full of peril. His health, however,
had no real prominence in my letter; and it is
strange now to observe that it appears as an argument
in his reply. I had simply put before him, in the
strongest form, all the considerations drawn from his
genius and fame that should deter him from the labour
and responsibility of a daily paper, not less than from
the party and political involvements incident to it; and
here was the material part of the answer made. "Many
thanks for your affectionate letter, which is full of generous
truth. These considerations weigh with me,
<i>heavily:</i> but I think I descry in these times, greater
stimulants to such an effort; greater chance of some
fair recognition of it; greater means of persevering in
it, or retiring from it unscratched by any weapon one
should care for; than at any other period. And most of
all I have, sometimes, that possibility of failing health
or fading popularity before me, which beckons me to
such a venture when it comes within my reach. At the
worst, I have written to little purpose, if I cannot <i>write
myself right</i> in people's minds, in such a case as this."</p>

<p>And so it went on: but it does not fall within my
plan to describe more than the issue, which was to be
accounted so far at least fortunate that it established a
journal which has advocated steadily improvements in
the condition of all classes, rich as well as poor, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_218" id="Page_2_218">[218]</a></span>
has been able, during late momentous occurrences, to
give wider scope to its influence by its enterprise and
liberality. To that result, the great writer whose name
gave its earliest attraction to the <i>Daily News</i> was not
enabled to contribute much; but from him it certainly
received the first impress of the opinions it has since
consistently maintained. Its prospectus is before me
in his handwriting, but it bears upon itself sufficiently
the character of his hand and mind. The paper would
be kept free, it said, from personal influence or party
bias; and would be devoted to the advocacy of all
rational and honest means by which wrong might be
redressed, just rights maintained, and the happiness and
welfare of society promoted.</p>

<p>The day for the appearance of its first number was
that which was to follow Peel's speech for the repeal of
the corn laws; but, brief as my allusions to the subject
are, the remark should be made that even before this
day came there were interruptions to the work of preparation,
at one time very grave, which threw such
"changes of vexation" on Dickens's personal relations
to the venture as went far to destroy both his faith and
his pleasure in it. No opinion need be offered as to
where most of the blame lay, and it would be useless
now to apportion the share that might possibly have
belonged to himself; but, owing to this cause, his editorial
work began with such diminished ardour that its
brief continuance could not but be looked for. A
little note written "before going home" at six o'clock
in the morning of Wednesday the 21st of January 1846,
to tell me they had "been at press three quarters of an
hour, and were out before the <i>Times</i>," marks the beginning;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_219" id="Page_2_219">[219]</a></span>
and a note written in the night of Monday
the 9th of February, "tired to death and quite worn
out," to say that he had just resigned his editorial functions,
describes the end. I had not been unprepared.
A week before (Friday 30th of January) he had written:
"I want a long talk with you. I was obliged to come
down here in a hurry to give out a travelling letter I
meant to have given out last night, and could not call
upon you. Will you dine with us to-morrow at six
sharp? I have been revolving plans in my mind this
morning for quitting the paper and going abroad again
to write a new book in shilling numbers. Shall we go
to Rochester to-morrow week (my birthday) if the
weather be, as it surely must be, better?" To Rochester
accordingly we had gone, he and Mrs. Dickens and
her sister, with Maclise and Jerrold and myself; going
over the old Castle, Watts's Charity, and Chatham
fortifications on the Saturday, passing Sunday in Cobham
church and Cobham park; having our quarters
both days at the Bull inn made famous in <i>Pickwick;</i>
and thus, by indulgence of the desire which was always
strangely urgent in him, associating his new resolve in
life with those earliest scenes of his youthful time. On
one point our feeling had been in thorough agreement.
If long continuance with the paper was not likely, the
earliest possible departure from it was desirable. But
as the letters descriptive of his Italian travel (turned
afterwards into <i>Pictures from Italy</i>) had begun with its
first number, his name could not at once be withdrawn;
and for the time during which they were still to appear,
he consented to contribute other occasional letters on
important social questions. Public executions and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_220" id="Page_2_220">[220]</a></span>
Ragged schools were among the subjects chosen by
him, and all were handled with conspicuous ability.
But the interval they covered was a short one.</p>

<p>To the supreme control which he had quitted, I succeeded,
retaining it very reluctantly for the greater part
of that weary, anxious, laborious year; but in little
more than four months from the day the paper started,
the whole of Dickens's connection with the <i>Daily
News</i>, even that of contributing letters with his signature,
had ceased. As he said in the preface to the
republished <i>Pictures</i>, it was a mistake to have disturbed
the old relations between himself and his readers, in so
departing from his old pursuits. It had however been
"a brief mistake;" the departure had been only "for
a moment;" and now those pursuits were "joyfully"
to be resumed in Switzerland. Upon the latter point
we had much discussion; but he was bent on again
removing himself from London, and his glimpse of the
Swiss mountains on his coming from Italy had given
him a passion to visit them again. "I don't think," he
wrote to me, "I <i>could</i> shut out the paper sufficiently,
here, to write well. No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I will write my book in
Lausanne and in Genoa, and forget everything else if I
can; and by living in Switzerland for the summer, and
in Italy or France for the winter, I shall be saving money
while I write." So therefore it was finally determined.</p>

<p>There is not much that calls for mention before he
left. The first conceiving of a new book was always
a restless time, and other subjects beside the characters
that were growing in his mind would persistently intrude
themselves into his night-wanderings. With some surprise
I heard from him afterwards, for example, of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_221" id="Page_2_221">[221]</a></span>
communication opened with a leading member of the
Government to ascertain what chances there might be
for his appointment, upon due qualification, to the paid
magistracy of London: the reply not giving him encouragement
to entertain the notion farther. It was
of course but an outbreak of momentary discontent;
and if the answer had been as hopeful as for others'
sake rather than his own one could have wished it to be,
the result would have been the same. Just upon the
eve of his departure, I may add, he took much interest
in the establishment of the General Theatrical Fund,
of which he remained a trustee until his death. It
had originated in the fact that the Funds of the two
large theatres, themselves then disused for theatrical
performances, were no longer available for the ordinary
members of the profession; and on the occasion of his
presiding at its first dinner in April he said, very happily,
that now the statue of Shakespeare outside the
door of Drury-lane, as emphatically as his bust inside
the church of Stratford-on-Avon, <i>pointed out his grave</i>.
I am tempted also to mention as felicitous a word
which I heard fall from him at one of the many private
dinners that were got up in those days of parting to
give him friendliest farewell. "Nothing is ever so
good as it is thought," said Lord Melbourne. "And
nothing so bad," interposed Dickens.</p>

<p>The last incidents were that he again obtained Roche
for his travelling servant, and that he let his Devonshire-terrace
house to Sir James Duke for twelve months,
the entire proposed term of his absence. On the 30th
of May they all dined with me, and on the following
day left England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halting</span> only at Ostend, Verviers, Coblentz, and
Mannheim, they reached Strasburg on the seventh of
June: the beauty of the weather<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> showing them the
Rhine at its best. At Mayence there had come aboard
their boat a German, who soon after accosted Mrs. Dickens
on deck in excellent English: "Your countryman
Mr. Dickens is travelling this way just now, our papers
say. Do you know him, or have you passed him anywhere?"
Explanations ensuing, it turned out, by one of
the odd chances my friend thought himself always singled
out for, that he had with him a letter of introduction to
the brother of this gentleman; who then spoke to him
of the popularity of his books in Germany, and of the
many persons he had seen reading them in the steamboats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_223" id="Page_2_223">[223]</a></span>
as he came along. Dickens remarking at this
how great his own vexation was not to be able himself
to speak a word of German, "Oh dear! that needn't
trouble you," rejoined the other; "for even in so small
a town as ours, where we are mostly primitive people
and have few travellers, I could make a party of at
least forty people who understand and speak English
as well as I do, and of at least as many more who
could manage to read you in the original." His town
was Worms, which Dickens afterwards saw, "&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a
fine old place, though greatly shrunken and decayed in
respect of its population; with a picturesque old cathedral
standing on the brink of the Rhine, and some
brave old churches shut up, and so hemmed in and
overgrown with vineyards that they look as if they
were turning into leaves and grapes."</p>

<p>He had no other adventure on the Rhine. But, on
the same steamer, a not unfamiliar bit of character
greeted him in the well-known lineaments, moral and
physical, of two travelling Englishmen who had got an
immense barouche on board with them, and had no
plan whatever of going anywhere in it. One of them
wanted to have this barouche wheeled ashore at every
little town and village they came to. The other was
bent upon "seeing it out," as he said&mdash;meaning,
Dickens supposed, the river; though neither of them
seemed to have the slightest interest in it. "The locomotive
one would have gone ashore without the carriage,
and would have been delighted to get rid of it;
but they had a joint courier, and neither of them
would part with <i>him</i> for a moment; so they went
growling and grumbling on together, and seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_224" id="Page_2_224">[224]</a></span>
have no satisfaction but in asking for impossible viands
on board the boat, and having a grim delight in the
steward's excuses."</p>

<p>From Strasburg they went by rail on the 8th to B&acirc;le,
from which they started for Lausanne next day, in
three coaches, two horses to each, taking three days
for the journey: its only enlivening incident being an
uproar between the landlord of an inn on the road,
and one of the voituriers who had libelled Boniface's
establishment by complaining of the food. "After
various defiances on both sides, the landlord said
'Sc&eacute;l&eacute;rat! M&eacute;cr&eacute;ant! Je vous boaxerai!' to which the
voiturier replied, 'Aha! Comment dites-vous? Voulez-vous
boaxer? Eh? Voulez-vous? Ah! Boaxez-moi
donc! Boaxez-moi!'&mdash;at the same time accompanying
these retorts with gestures of violent significance,
which explained that this new verb-active was founded
on the well-known English verb to boax, or box. If
they used it once, they used it at least a hundred times,
and goaded each other to madness with it always."
The travellers reached the hotel Gibbon at Lausanne
on the evening of Thursday the 11th of June; having
been tempted as they came along to rest somewhat
short of it, by a delightful glimpse of Neuch&acirc;tel. "On
consideration however I thought it best to come on
here, in case I should find, when I begin to write, that
I want streets sometimes. In which case, Geneva
(which I hope would answer the purpose) is only four
and twenty miles away."</p>

<p>He at once began house-hunting, and had two days'
hard work of it. He found the greater part of those
let to the English like small villas in the Regent's-park,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_225" id="Page_2_225">[225]</a></span>
with verandahs, glass-doors opening on lawns, and
alcoves overlooking the lake and mountains. One he
was tempted by, higher up the hill, "poised above the
town like a ship on a high wave;" but the possible
fury of its winter winds deterred him. Greater still
was the temptation to him of "L'Elys&eacute;e," more a
mansion than a villa; with splendid grounds overlooking
the lake, and in its corridors and staircases as well
as furniture like an old fashioned country house in
England; which he could have got for twelve months
for &pound;160. "But when I came to consider its vastness,
I was rather dismayed at the prospect of windy nights
in the autumn, with nobody staying in the house to
make it gay." And so he again fell back upon the
very first place he had seen, Rosemont, quite a doll's
house; with two pretty little salons, a dining-room,
hall, and kitchen, on the ground floor; and with just
enough bedrooms upstairs to leave the family one to
spare. "It is beautifully situated on the hill that rises
from the lake, within ten minutes' walk of this hotel,
and furnished, though scantily as all here are, better
than others except Elys&eacute;e, on account of its having
being built and fitted up (the little salons in the Parisian
way) by the landlady and her husband for themselves.
They lived now in a smaller house like a
porter's lodge, just within the gate. A portion of the
grounds is farmed by a farmer, and <i>he</i> lives close by;
so that, while it is secluded, it is not at all lonely."
The rent was to be ten pounds a month for half a
year, with reduction to eight for the second half, if he
should stay so long; and the rooms and furniture were
to be described to me, so that according to custom I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_226" id="Page_2_226">[226]</a></span>
should be quite at home there, as soon as, also according
to a custom well-known, his own ingenious re-arrangements
and improvements in the chairs and
tables should be completed. "I shall merely observe
at present therefore, that my little study is upstairs,
and looks out, from two French windows opening into
a balcony, on the lake and mountains; and that there
are roses enough to smother the whole establishment
of the <i>Daily News</i> in. Likewise, there is a pavilion in
the garden, which has but two rooms in it; in one of
which, I think you shall do your work when you come.
As to bowers for reading and smoking, there are as
many scattered about the grounds, as there are in
Chalk-farm tea-gardens. But the Rosemont bowers
are really beautiful. Will you come to the bowers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?"</p>

<p>Very pleasant were the earliest impressions of Switzerland
with which this first letter closed. "The
country is delightful in the extreme&mdash;as leafy, green,
and shady, as England; full of deep glens, and branchy
places (rather a Leigh Huntish expression), and bright
with all sorts of flowers in profusion.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> It abounds in
singing birds besides&mdash;very pleasant after Italy; and
the moonlight on the lake is noble. Prodigious mountains
rise up from its opposite shore (it is eight or nine
miles across, at this point), and the Simplon, the St.
Gothard, Mont Blanc, and all the Alpine wonders are
piled there, in tremendous grandeur. The cultivation
is uncommonly rich and profuse. There are all manner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_227" id="Page_2_227">[227]</a></span>
of walks, vineyards, green lanes, cornfields, and
pastures full of hay. The general neatness is as remarkable
as in England. There are no priests or
monks in the streets, and the people appear to be industrious
and thriving. French (and very intelligible
and pleasant French) seems to be the universal language.
I never saw so many booksellers' shops
crammed within the same space, as in the steep up-and-down
streets of Lausanne."</p>

<p>Of the little town he spoke in his next letter as
having its natural dulness increased by that fact of its
streets going up and down hill abruptly and steeply,
like the streets in a dream; and the consequent difficulty
of getting about it. "There are some suppressed
churches in it, now used as packers' warehouses: with
cranes and pulleys growing out of steeple-towers; little
doors for lowering goods through, fitted into blocked-up
oriel windows; and cart-horses stabled in crypts.
These also help to give it a deserted and disused appearance.
On the other hand, as it is a perfectly free
place subject to no prohibitions or restrictions of any
kind, there are all sorts of new French books and publications
in it, and all sorts of fresh intelligence from
the world beyond the Jura mountains. It contains
only one Roman Catholic church, which is mainly for
the use of the Savoyards and Piedmontese who come
trading over the Alps. As for the country, it cannot
be praised too highly, or reported too beautiful. There
are no great waterfalls, or walks through mountain-gorges,
<i>close</i> at hand, as in some other parts of Switzerland;
but there is a charming variety of enchanting
scenery. There is the shore of the lake, where you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_228" id="Page_2_228">[228]</a></span>
may dip your feet, as you walk, in the deep blue water,
if you choose. There are the hills to climb up, leading
to the great heights above the town; or to stagger
down, leading to the lake. There is every possible
variety of deep green lanes, vineyard, cornfield, pasture-land,
and wood. There are excellent country
roads that might be in Kent or Devonshire: and,
closing up every view and vista, is an eternally changing
range of prodigious mountains&mdash;sometimes red, sometimes
grey, sometimes purple, sometimes black; sometimes
white with snow; sometimes close at hand; and
sometimes very ghosts in the clouds and mist."</p>

<p>In the heart of these things he was now to live and
work for at least six months; and, as the love of nature
was as much a passion with him in his intervals of
leisure, as the craving for crowds and streets when he
was busy with the creatures of his fancy, no man was
better qualified to enjoy what was thus open to him
from his little farm.</p>

<p>The view from each side of it was different in character,
and from one there was visible the liveliest
aspect of Lausanne itself, close at hand, and seeming,
as he said, to be always coming down the hill with its
steeples and towers, not able to stop itself. "From a
fine long broad balcony on which the windows of my
little study on the first floor (where I am now writing)
open, the lake is seen to wonderful advantage,&mdash;losing
itself by degrees in the solemn gorge of mountains
leading to the Simplon pass. Under the balcony is a
stone colonnade, on which the six French windows of
the drawing-room open; and quantities of plants are
clustered about the pillars and seats, very prettily. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_229" id="Page_2_229">[229]</a></span>
of these drawing-rooms is furnished (like a French
hotel) with red velvet, and the other with green; in
both, plenty of mirrors and nice white muslin curtains;
and for the larger one in cold weather there is a carpet,
the floors being bare now, but inlaid in squares with
different-coloured woods." His description did not
close until, in every nook and corner inhabited by
the several members of the family, I was made to feel
myself at home; but only the final sentence need be
added. "Walking out into the balcony as I write, I
am suddenly reminded, by the sight of the Castle of
Chillon glittering in the sunlight on the lake, that I
omitted to mention that object in my catalogue of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_230" id="Page_2_230">[230]</a></span>
Rosemont beauties. Please to put it in, like George
Robins, in a line by itself."</p>

</div>

<p>Regular evening walks of nine or ten miles were
named in the same letter (22nd of June) as having been
begun;<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and thoughts of his books were already stirring
in him. "An odd shadowy undefined idea is at
work within me, that I could connect a great battle-field
somehow with my little Christmas story. Shapeless
visions of the repose and peace pervading it in
after-time; with the corn and grass growing over the
slain, and people singing at the plough; are so perpetually
floating before me, that I cannot but think
there may turn out to be something good in them when
I see them more plainly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I want to get Four
Numbers of the monthly book done here, and the
Christmas book. If all goes well, and nothing changes,
and I can accomplish this by the end of November, I
shall run over to you in England for a few days with a
light heart, and leave Roche to move the caravan to
Paris in the meanwhile. It will be just the very point
in the story when the life and crowd of that extraordinary
place will come vividly to my assistance in writing."
Such was his design; and, though difficulties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_231" id="Page_2_231">[231]</a></span>
not now seen started up which he had a hard fight to
get through, he managed to accomplish it. His letter
ended with a promise to tell me, when next he wrote,
of the small colony of English who seemed ready to
give him even more than the usual welcome. Two
visits had thus early been paid him by Mr. Haldimand,
formerly a member of the English parliament, an
accomplished man, who, with his sister Mrs. Marcet
(the well-known authoress), had long made Lausanne
his home. He had a very fine seat just below Rosemont,
and his character and station had made him
quite the little sovereign of the place. "He has
founded and endowed all sorts of hospitals and institutions
here, and he gives a dinner to-morrow to introduce
our neighbours, whoever they are."</p>

<p>He found them to be happily the kind of people who
rendered entirely pleasant those frank and cordial hospitalities
which the charm of his personal intercourse
made every one so eager to offer him. The dinner at
Mr. Haldimand's was followed by dinners from the
guests he met there; from an English lady<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> married to
a Swiss, Mr. and Mrs. Cerjat, clever and agreeable both,
far beyond the common; from her sister wedded to an
Englishman, Mr. and Mrs. Goff; and from Mr. and Mrs.
Watson of Rockingham-castle in Northamptonshire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_232" id="Page_2_232">[232]</a></span>
who had taken the Elys&eacute;e on Dickens giving it up, and
with whom, as with Mr. Haldimand, his relations continued
to be very intimate long after he left Lausanne.
In his drive to Mr. Cerjat's dinner a whimsical difficulty
presented itself. He had set up, for use of his wife and
children, an odd little one-horse-carriage; made to
hold three persons sideways, so that they should avoid
the wind always blowing up or down the valley; and he
found it attended with one of the drollest consequences
conceivable. "It can't be easily turned; and as you
face to the side, all sorts of evolutions are necessary
to bring you 'broad-side to' before the door of the
house where you are going. The country houses here
are very like those upon the Thames between Richmond
and Kingston (this, particularly), with grounds all
round. At Mr. Cerjat's we were obliged to be carried,
like the child's riddle, round the house and round the
house, without touching the house; and we were presented
in the most alarming manner, three of a row,
first to all the people in the kitchen, then to the governess
who was dressing in her bedroom, then to the
drawing-room where the company were waiting for us,
then to the dining-room where they were spreading the
table, and finally to the hall where we were got out&mdash;scraping
the windows of each apartment as we glared
slowly into it."</p>

<p>A dinner party of his own followed of course; and
a sad occurrence, of which he and his guests were
unconscious, signalised the evening (15th of July).
"While we were sitting at dinner, one of the prettiest
girls in Lausanne was drowned in the lake&mdash;in the
most peaceful water, reflecting the steep mountains, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_233" id="Page_2_233">[233]</a></span>
crimson with the setting sun. She was bathing in one
of the nooks set apart for women, and seems somehow
to have entangled her feet in the skirts of her dress.
She was an accomplished swimmer, as many of the girls
are here, and drifted, suddenly, out of only five feet
water. Three or four friends who were with her, <i>ran
away</i>, screaming. Our children's governess was on the
lake in a boat with M. Verdeil (my prison-doctor) and
his family. They ran inshore immediately; the body
was quickly got out; and M. Verdeil, with three or
four other doctors, laboured for some hours to restore
animation; but she only sighed once. After all that
time, she was obliged to be borne, stiff and stark, to her
father's house. She was his only child, and but 17
years old. He has been nearly dead since, and all
Lausanne has been full of the story. I was down by
the lake, near the place, last night; and a boatman
<i>acted</i> to me the whole scene: depositing himself finally
on a heap of stones, to represent the body."</p>

<p>With M. Verdeil, physician to the prison and vice-president
of the council of health, introduced by Mr.
Haldimand, there had already been much communication;
and I could give nothing more characteristic of
Dickens than his reference to this, and other similar
matters in which his interest was strongly moved during
his first weeks at Lausanne.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_234" id="Page_2_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p>"Some years ago, when they set about reforming the
prison at Lausanne, they turned their attention, in a
correspondence of republican feeling, to America; and
taking the Philadelphian system for granted, adopted
it. Terrible fits, new phases of mental affection, and
horrible madness, among the prisoners, were very soon
the result; and attained to such an alarming height,
that M. Verdeil, in his public capacity, began to report
against the system, and went on reporting and working
against it until he formed a party who were determined
not to have it, and caused it to be abolished&mdash;except
in cases where the imprisonment does not exceed ten
months in the whole. It is remarkable that in his notes
of the different cases, there is <i>every effect</i> I mentioned
as having observed myself at Philadelphia; even down
to those contained in the description of the man who
had been there thirteen years, and who <i>picked his hands</i>
so much as he talked. He has only recently, he says,
read the <i>American Notes;</i> but he is so much struck by
the perfect coincidence that he intends to republish
some extracts from his own notes, side by side with
these passages of mine translated into French. I went
with him over the prison the other day. It is wonderfully
well arranged for a continental jail, and in perfect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_235" id="Page_2_235">[235]</a></span>
order. The sentences however, or some of them, are
very terrible. I saw one man sent there for murder
under circumstances of mitigation&mdash;for 30 years. Upon
the silent social system all the time! They weave, and
plait straw, and make shoes, small articles of turnery
and carpentry, and little common wooden clocks. But
the sentences are too long for that monotonous and
hopeless life; and, though they are well-fed and cared
for, they generally break down utterly after two or three
years. One delusion seems to become common to
three-fourths of them after a certain time of imprisonment.
Under the impression that there is something
destructive put into their food 'pour les gu&eacute;rir de
crime' (says M. Verdeil), they refuse to eat!"</p>

<p>It was at the Blind Institution, however, of which
Mr. Haldimand was the president and great benefactor,
that Dickens's attention was most deeply arrested; and
there were two cases in especial of which the detail may
be read with as much interest now as when my friend's
letters were written, and as to which his own suggestions
open up still rather startling trains of thought.
The first, which in its attraction for him he found
equal even to Laura Bridgman's, was that of a young
man of 18: "born deaf and dumb, and stricken blind
by an accident when he was about five years old. The
Director of the institution is a young German, of great
ability, and most uncommonly prepossessing appearance.
He propounded to the scientific bodies of
Geneva, a year ago (when this young man was under
education in the asylum), the possibility of teaching
him to speak&mdash;in other words, to play with his tongue
upon his teeth and palate as if on an instrument, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_236" id="Page_2_236">[236]</a></span>
connect particular performances with particular words
conveyed to him in the finger-language. They unanimously
agreed that it was quite impossible. The German
set to work, and the young man now speaks very
plainly and distinctly: without the least modulation,
of course, but with comparatively little hesitation; expressing
the words aloud as they are struck, so to speak,
upon his hands; and showing the most intense and
wonderful delight in doing it. This is commonly acquired,
as you know, by the deaf and dumb who learn
by sight; but it has never before been achieved in the
case of a deaf, dumb, and blind subject. He is an extremely
lively, intelligent, good-humoured fellow; an
excellent carpenter; a first-rate turner; and runs about
the building with a certainty and confidence which
none of the merely blind pupils acquire. He has a
great many ideas, and an instinctive dread of death.
He knows of God, as of Thought enthroned somewhere;
and once told, on nature's prompting (the
devil's of course), a lie. He was sitting at dinner, and
the Director asked him whether he had had anything
to drink; to which he instantly replied 'No,' in order
that he might get some more, though he had been
served in his turn. It was explained to him that this
was a wrong thing, and wouldn't do, and that he was
to be locked up in a room for it: which was done.
Soon after this, he had a dream of being bitten in the
shoulder by some strange animal. As it left a great
impression on his mind, he told M. the Director that
he had told another lie in the night. In proof of it
he related his dream, and added, 'It must be a lie
you know, because there is no strange animal here,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_237" id="Page_2_237">[237]</a></span>
and I never was bitten.' Being informed that this sort
of lie was a harmless one, and was called a dream, he
asked whether dead people ever dreamed<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> while they
were lying in the ground. He is one of the most
curious and interesting studies possible."</p>

<p>The second case had come in on the very day that
Dickens visited the place. "When I was there" (8th
of July) "there had come in, that morning, a girl of
ten years old, born deaf and dumb and blind, and so
perfectly untaught that she has not learnt to have the
least control even over the performance of the common
natural functions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And yet she <i>laughs sometimes</i>
(good God! conceive what at!)&mdash;and is dreadfully
sensitive from head to foot, and very much alarmed,
for some hours before the coming on of a thunder
storm. Mr. Haldimand has been long trying to induce
her parents to send her to the asylum. At last they
have consented; and when I saw her, some of the
little blind girls were trying to make friends with her,
and to lead her gently about. She was dressed in just
a loose robe from the necessity of changing her frequently,
but had been in a bath, and had had her nails
cut (which were previously very long and dirty), and
was not at all ill-looking&mdash;quite the reverse; with a
remarkably good and pretty little mouth, but a low and
undeveloped head of course. It was pointed out to
me, as very singular, that the moment she is left alone,
or freed from anybody's touch (which is the same thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_238" id="Page_2_238">[238]</a></span>
to her), she instantly crouches down with her hands up
to her ears, in exactly the position of a child before its
birth; and so remains. I thought this such a strange
coincidence with the utter want of advancement in her
moral being, that it made a great impression on me;
and conning it over and over, I began to think that
this is surely the invariable action of savages too, and
that I have seen it over and over again described in
books of voyages and travels. Not having any of
these with me, I turned to <i>Robinson Crusoe;</i> and I find
De Foe says, describing the savages who came on the
island after Will Atkins began to change for the better
and commanded under the grave Spaniard for the
common defence, 'their posture was generally sitting
upon the ground, with their knees up towards their
mouth, and the head put between the two hands, leaning
down upon the knees'&mdash;exactly the same attitude!"
In his next week's letter he reported further: "I have
not been to the Blind asylum again yet, but they tell
me that the deaf and dumb and blind child's <i>face</i> is
improving obviously, and that she takes great delight
in the first effort made by the Director to connect himself
with an occupation of her time. He gives her,
every day, two smooth round pebbles to roll over and
over between her two hands. She appears to have an
idea that it is to lead to something; distinctly recognizes
the hand that gives them to her, as a friendly and
protecting one; and sits for hours quite busy."</p>

<p>To one part of his very thoughtful suggestion I objected,
and would have attributed to a mere desire for
warmth, in her as in the savage, what he supposed to
be part of an undeveloped or embryo state explaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_239" id="Page_2_239">[239]</a></span>
also the absence of sentient and moral being. To this
he replied (25th of July): "I do not think that there
is reason for supposing that the savage attitude originates
in the desire of warmth, because all naked savages
inhabit hot climates; and their instinctive attitude, if
it had reference to heat or cold, would probably be the
coolest possible; like their delight in water, and swimming.
I do not think there is any race of savage men,
however low in grade, inhabiting cold climates, who
do not kill beasts and wear their skins. The girl
decidedly improves in face, and, if one can yet use the
word as applied to her, in manner too. No communication
by the speech of touch has yet been established
with her, but the time has not been long enough." In
a later letter he tells me (24th of August): "The deaf,
dumb, and blind girl is decidedly improved, and very
much improved, in this short time. No communication
is yet established with her, but that is not to be expected.
They have got her out of that strange, crouching
position; dressed her neatly; and accustomed her to
have a pleasure in society. She laughs frequently, and
also claps her hands and jumps; having, God knows
how, some inward satisfaction. I never saw a more
tremendous thing in its way, in my life, than when
they stood her, t'other day, in the centre of a group of
blind children who sang a chorus to the piano; and
brought her hand, and kept it, in contact with the instrument.
A shudder pervaded her whole being, her
breath quickened, her colour deepened,&mdash;and I can
compare it to nothing but returning animation in a person
nearly dead. It was really awful to see how the sensation
of the music fluttered and stirred the locked-up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_240" id="Page_2_240">[240]</a></span>
soul within her." The same letter spoke again of the
youth: "The male subject is well and jolly as possible.
He is very fond of smoking. I have arranged to supply
him with cigars during our stay here; so he and I
are in amazing sympathy. I don't know whether he
thinks I grow them, or make them, or produce them
by winking, or what. But it gives him a notion that
the world in general belongs to me."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Before his
kind friend left Lausanne the poor fellow had been
taught to say, "Monsieur Dickens m'a donn&eacute; les
cigares," and at their leave-taking his gratitude was expressed
by incessant repetition of these words for a full
half-hour.</p>

<p>Certainly by no man was gratitude more persistently
earned, than by Dickens, from all to whom nature or
the world had been churlish or unfair. Not to those
only made desolate by poverty or the temptations incident
to it, but to those whom natural defects or infirmities
had placed at a disadvantage with their kind,
he gave his first consideration; helping them personally
where he could, sympathising and sorrowing with
them always, but above all applying himself to the investigation
of such alleviation or cure as philosophy or
science might be able to apply to their condition.
This was a desire so eager as properly to be called one
of the passions of his life, visible in him to the last
hour of it.</p>

<p>Only a couple of weeks, themselves not idle ones,
had passed over him at Rosemont when he made a
dash at the beginning of his real work; from which indeed
he had only been detained so long by the non-arrival
of a box dispatched from London before his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_241" id="Page_2_241">[241]</a></span>
departure, containing not his proper writing materials
only, but certain quaint little bronze figures that thus
early stood upon his desk, and were as much needed
for the easy flow of his writing as blue ink or quill pens.
"I have not been idle" (28th of June) "since I have
been here, though at first I was 'kept out' of the big
box as you know. I had a good deal to write for Lord
John about the Ragged schools. I set to work and did
that. A good deal for Miss Coutts, in reference to her
charitable projects. I set to work and did <i>that</i>. Half
of the children's New Testament<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> to write, or pretty
nearly. I set to work and did <i>that</i>. Next I cleared
off the greater part of such correspondence as I had
rashly pledged myself to; and then.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<div class='center'>
BEGAN DOMBEY!<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>I performed this feat yesterday&mdash;only wrote the first
slip&mdash;but there it is, and it is a plunge straight over
head and ears into the story.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Besides all this, I have
really gone with great vigour at the French, where I
find myself greatly assisted by the Italian; and am
subject to two descriptions of mental fits in reference
to the Christmas book: one, of the suddenest and
wildest enthusiasm; one, of solitary and anxious consideration.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_242" id="Page_2_242">[242]</a></span>
By the way, as I was unpacking the
big box I took hold of a book, and said to 'Them,'&mdash;'Now,
whatever passage my thumb rests on, I shall
take as having reference to my work.' It was <span class="smcap">Tristram
Shandy</span>, and opened at these words, 'What a
work it is likely to turn out! Let us begin it!'"</div>

<p>The same letter told me that he still inclined strongly
to "the field of battle notion" for his Christmas volume,
but was not as yet advanced in it; being curious
first to see whether its capacity seemed to strike me at
all. My only objection was to his adventure of opening
two stories at once, of which he did not yet see
the full danger; but for the moment the Christmas
fancy was laid aside, and not resumed, except in passing
allusions, until after the close of August, when the
first two numbers of <i>Dombey</i> were done. The interval
supplied fresh illustration of his life in his new home,
not without much interest; and as I have shown what
a pleasant social circle, "wonderfully friendly and
hospitable"<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> to the last, already had grouped itself
round him in Lausanne, and how full of "matter to
be heard and learn'd" he found such institutions as its
prison and blind school, the picture will receive attractive
touches if I borrow from his letters written
during this outset of <i>Dombey</i>, some farther notices as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_243" id="Page_2_243">[243]</a></span>
well of the general progress of his work, as of what
was specially interesting or amusing to him at the time,
and of how the country and the people impressed him.
In all of these his character will be found strongly
marked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> at once had struck him as the wonderful
feature in the mountain scenery was its everchanging
and yet unchanging aspect. It was never twice like
the same thing to him. Shifting and altering, advancing
and retreating, fifty times a day, it was unalterable
only in its grandeur. The lake itself too had every
kind of varying beauty for him. By moonlight it was
indescribably solemn; and before the coming on of a
storm had a strange property in it of being disturbed,
while yet the sky remained clear and the evening
bright, which he found to be mysterious and impressive
in an especial degree. Such a storm had come among
his earliest and most grateful experiences; a degree of
heat worse even than in Italy<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> having disabled him at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_245" id="Page_2_245">[245]</a></span>
the outset for all exertion until the lightning, thunder,
and rain arrived. The letter telling me this (5th July)
described the fruit as so abundant in the little farm,
that the trees of the orchard in front of his house were
bending beneath it; spoke of a field of wheat sloping
down to the side window of his dining-room as already
cut and carried; and said that the roses, which the
hurricane of rain had swept away, were come back
lovelier and in greater numbers than ever.</p>

<p>Of the ordinary Swiss people he formed from the
first a high opinion which everything during his stay
among them confirmed. He thought it the greatest
injustice to call them "the Americans of the Continent."
In his first letters he said of the peasantry all
about Lausanne that they were as pleasant a people as
need be. He never passed, on any of the roads, man,
woman, or child, without a salutation; and anything
churlish or disagreeable he never noticed in them.
"They have not," he continued, "the sweetness and
grace of the Italians, or the agreeable manners of the
better specimens of French peasantry, but they are admirably
educated (the schools of this canton are extraordinarily
good, in every little village), and always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_246" id="Page_2_246">[246]</a></span>
prepared to give a civil and pleasant answer. There is
no greater mistake. I was talking to my landlord<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
about it the other day, and he said he could not conceive
how it had ever arisen, but that when he returned
from his eighteen years' service in the English navy he
shunned the people, and had no interest in them until
they gradually forced their real character upon his observation.
We have a cook and a coachman here,
taken at hazard from the people of the town; and I
never saw more obliging servants, or people who did
their work so truly <i>with a will</i>. And in point of cleanliness,
order, and punctuality to the moment, they are
unrivalled.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>The first great gathering of the Swiss peasantry
which he saw was in the third week after his arrival,
when a country f&ecirc;te was held at a place called The
Signal; a deep green wood, on the sides and summit
of a very high hill overlooking the town and all the
country round; and he gave me very pleasant account
of it. "There were various booths for eating and
drinking, and the selling of trinkets and sweetmeats;
and in one place there was a great circle cleared, in
which the common people waltzed and polka'd, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_247" id="Page_2_247">[247]</a></span>
cessation, to the music of a band. There was a
great roundabout for children (oh my stars what a
family were proprietors of it! A sunburnt father and
mother, a humpbacked boy, a great poodle-dog possessed
of all sorts of accomplishments, and a young
murderer of seventeen who turned the machinery);
and there were some games of chance and skill established
under trees. It was very pretty. In some of
the drinking booths there were parties of German
peasants, twenty together perhaps, singing national
drinking-songs, and making a most exhilarating and
musical chorus by rattling their cups and glasses on
the table and drinking them against each other, to a
regular tune. You know it as a stage dodge, but the
real thing is splendid. Farther down the hill, other
peasants were rifle-shooting for prizes, at targets set on
the other side of a deep ravine, from two to three
hundred yards off. It was quite fearful to see the
astonishing accuracy of their aim, and how, every time
a rifle awakened the ten thousand echoes of the green
glen, some men crouching behind a little wall immediately
in front of the targets, sprung up with large
numbers in their hands denoting where the ball had
struck the bull's eye&mdash;and then in a moment disappeared
again. Standing in a ring near these shooters
was another party of Germans singing hunting-songs,
in parts, most melodiously. And down in the distance
was Lausanne, with all sorts of haunted-looking old
towers rising up before the smooth water of the lake,
and an evening sky all red, and gold, and bright
green. When it closed in quite dark, all the booths
were lighted up; and the twinkling of the lamps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_248" id="Page_2_248">[248]</a></span>
among the forest of trees was beautiful.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." To
this pretty picture, a letter of a little later date, describing
a marriage on the farm, added farther comical
illustration of the rifle-firing propensities of the Swiss,
and had otherwise also whimsical touches of character.
"One of the farmer's people&mdash;a sister, I think&mdash;was
married from here the other day. It is wonderful to
see how naturally the smallest girls are interested in
marriages. Katey and Mamey were as excited as if
they were eighteen. The fondness of the Swiss for
gunpowder on interesting occasions, is one of the
drollest things. For three days before, the farmer
himself, in the midst of his various agricultural duties,
plunged out of a little door near my windows, about
once in every hour, and fired off a rifle. I thought
he was shooting rats who were spoiling the vines; but
he was merely relieving his mind, it seemed, on the
subject of the approaching nuptials. All night afterwards,
he and a small circle of friends kept perpetually
letting off guns under the casement of the bridal chamber.
A Bride is always drest here, in black silk; but
this bride wore merino of that colour, observing to
her mother when she bought it (the old lady is 82, and
works on the farm), 'You know, mother, I am sure
to want mourning for you, soon; and the same gown
will do.'"<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_249" id="Page_2_249">[249]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, day by day, he was steadily moving on
with his first number; feeling sometimes the want of
streets in an "extraordinary nervousness it would be
hardly possible to describe," that would come upon
him after he had been writing all day; but at all other
times finding the repose of the place very favourable to
industry. "I am writing slowly at first, of course"
(5th of July), "but I hope I shall have finished the
first number in the course of a fortnight at farthest. I
have done the first chapter, and begun another. I say
nothing of the merits thus far, or of the idea beyond
what is known to you; because I prefer that you should
come as fresh as may be upon them. I shall certainly
have a great surprise for people at the end of the fourth
number;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and I think there is a new and peculiar sort
of interest, involving the necessity of a little bit of
delicate treatment whereof I will expound my idea to
you by and by. When I have done this number, I may
take a run to Chamounix perhaps.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My thoughts
have necessarily been called away from the Christmas
book. The first <i>Dombey</i> done, I think I should fly off
to that, whenever the idea presented itself vividly before
me. I still cherish the Battle fancy, though it is
nothing but a fancy as yet." A week later he told me
that he hoped to finish the first number by that day
week or thereabouts, when he should then run and look
for his Christmas book in the glaciers at Chamounix.
His progress to this point had been pleasing him. "I
think <i>Dombey</i> very strong&mdash;with great capacity in its
leading idea; plenty of character that is likely to tell;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_250" id="Page_2_250">[250]</a></span>
and some rollicking facetiousness, to say nothing of
pathos. I hope you will soon judge of it for yourself,
however; and I know you will say what you think. I
have been very constantly at work." Six days later I
heard that he had still eight slips to write, and for a
week had put off Chamounix.</p>

<p>But though the fourth chapter yet was incomplete, he
could repress no longer the desire to write to me of what
he was doing (18th of July). "I think the general
idea of <i>Dombey</i> is interesting and new, and has great
material in it. But I don't like to discuss it with you
till you have read number one, for fear I should spoil
its effect. When done&mdash;about Wednesday or Thursday,
please God&mdash;I will send it in two days' posts,
seven letters each day. If you have it set at once (I
am afraid you couldn't read it, otherwise than in print)
I know you will impress on B. &amp; E. the necessity of
the closest secrecy. The very name getting out, would
be ruinous. The points for illustration, and the enormous
care required, make me excessively anxious. The
man for Dombey, if Browne could see him, the class
man to a T, is Sir A&mdash;&mdash; E&mdash;&mdash;, of D&mdash;&mdash;'s. Great pains
will be necessary with Miss Tox. The Toodle family
should not be too much caricatured, because of Polly.
I should like Browne to think of Susan Nipper, who
will not be wanted in the first number. After the second
number, they will all be nine or ten years older, but
this will not involve much change in the characters,
except in the children and Miss Nipper. What a brilliant
thing to be telling you all these names so familiarly,
when you know nothing about 'em! I quite
enjoy it. By the bye, I hope you may like the introduction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_251" id="Page_2_251">[251]</a></span>
of Solomon Gills.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> I think he lives in a good
sort of house.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One word more. What do you
think, as a name for the Christmas book, of <span class="smcap">The
Battle of Life</span>? It is not a name I have conned at
all, but has just occurred to me in connection with that
foggy idea. If I can see my way, I think I will take it
next, and clear it off. If you knew how it hangs about
me, I am sure you would say so too. It would be an
immense relief to have it done, and nothing standing
in the way of <i>Dombey</i>."</p>

<p>Within the time left for it the opening number was
done, but two little incidents preceded still the trip to
Chamounix. The first was a visit from Hallam to Mr.
Haldimand. "Heavens! how Hallam did talk yesterday!
I don't think I ever saw him so tremendous.
Very good-natured and pleasant, in his way, but Good
Heavens! how he did talk. That famous day you and
I remember was nothing to it. His son was with him,
and his daughter (who has an impediment in her
speech, as if nature were determined to balance that
faculty in the family), and his niece, a pretty woman,
the wife of a clergyman and a friend of Thackeray's.
It strikes me that she must be 'the little woman' he
proposed to take us to drink tea with, once, in Golden-square.
Don't you remember? His great favourite?
She is quite a charming person anyhow." I hope to
be pardoned for preserving an opinion which more
familiar later acquaintance confirmed, and which can
hardly now give anything but pleasure to the lady of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_252" id="Page_2_252">[252]</a></span>
whom it is expressed. To the second incident he
alludes more briefly. "As Haldimand and Mrs.
Marcet and the Cerjats had devised a small mountain
expedition for us for to-morrow, I didn't like to allow
Chamounix to stand in the way. So we go with them
first, and start on our own account on Tuesday. We
are extremely pleasant with these people." The close
of the same letter (25th of July), mentioning two pieces
of local news, gives intimation of the dangers incident
to all Swiss travelling, and of such special precautions
as were necessary for the holiday among the mountains
he was now about to take. "My first news is that a
crocodile is said to have escaped from the Zoological
gardens at Geneva, and to be now 'zigzag-zigging'
about the lake. But I can't make out whether this is a
great fact, or whether it is a pious fraud to prevent too
much bathing and liability to accidents. The other
piece of news is more serious. An English family
whose name I don't know, consisting of a father,
mother, and daughter, arrived at the hotel Gibbon here
last Monday, and started off on some mountain expedition
in one of the carriages of the country. It was
a mere track, the road, and ought to have been travelled
only by mules, but the Englishman persisted (as
Englishmen do) in going on in the carriage; and in
answer to all the representations of the driver that no
carriage had ever gone up there, said he needn't be
afraid he wasn't going to be paid for it, and so forth.
Accordingly, the coachman got down and walked by
the horses' heads. It was fiery hot; and, after much
tugging and rearing, the horses began to back, and
went down bodily, carriage and all, into a deep ravine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_253" id="Page_2_253">[253]</a></span>
The mother was killed on the spot; and the father and
daughter are lying at some house hard by, not expected
to recover."</p>

<p>His next letter (written on the second of August)
described his own first real experience of mountain-travel.
"I begin my letter to-night, but only begin,
for we returned from Chamounix in time for dinner
just now, and are pretty considerably done up. We
went by a mountain pass not often crossed by ladies,
called the Col de Balme, where your imagination may
picture Kate and Georgy on mules <i>for ten hours at a
stretch</i>, riding up and down the most frightful precipices.
We returned by the pass of the T&ecirc;te Noire,
which Talfourd knows, and which is of a different
character, but astonishingly fine too. Mont Blanc, and
the Valley of Chamounix, and the Mer de Glace, and
all the wonders of that most wonderful place, are above
and beyond one's wildest expectations. I cannot imagine
anything in nature more stupendous or sublime.
If I were to write about it now, I should quite rave&mdash;such
prodigious impressions are rampant within me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You may suppose that the mule-travelling is pretty
primitive. Each person takes a carpet-bag strapped on
the mule behind himself or herself: and that is all the
baggage that can be carried. A guide, a thorough-bred
mountaineer, walks all the way, leading the lady's
mule; I say the lady's par excellence, in compliment
to Kate; and all the rest struggle on as they please.
The cavalcade stops at a lone hut for an hour and a
half in the middle of the day, and lunches brilliantly
on whatever it can get. Going by that Col de Balme
pass, you climb up and up and up for five hours and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_254" id="Page_2_254">[254]</a></span>
more, and look&mdash;from a mere unguarded ledge of path
on the side of the precipice&mdash;into such awful valleys,
that at last you are firm in the belief that you have got
above everything in the world, and that there can be
nothing earthly overhead. Just as you arrive at this
conclusion, a different (and oh Heaven! what a free
and wonderful) air comes blowing on your face; you
cross a ridge of snow; and lying before you (wholly
unseen till then), towering up into the distant sky, is
the vast range of Mont Blanc, with attendant mountains
diminished by its majestic side into mere dwarfs
tapering up into innumerable rude Gothic pinnacles;
deserts of ice and snow; forests of firs on mountain
sides, of no account at all in the enormous scene;
villages down in the hollow, that you can shut out with
a finger; waterfalls, avalanches, pyramids and towers
of ice, torrents, bridges; mountain upon mountain
until the very sky is blocked away, and you must look
up, overhead, to see it. Good God, what a country
Switzerland is, and what a concentration of it is to be
beheld from that one spot! And (think of this in
Whitefriars and in Lincoln's-inn!) at noon on the
second day from here, the first day being but half a
one by the bye and full of uncommon beauty, you lie
down on that ridge and see it all!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think I must
go back again (whether you come or not!) and see it
again before the bad weather arrives. We have had
sunlight, moonlight, a perfectly transparent atmosphere
with not a cloud, and the grand plateau on the
very summit of Mont Blanc so clear by day and night
that it was difficult to believe in intervening chasms
and precipices, and almost impossible to resist the idea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_255" id="Page_2_255">[255]</a></span>
that one might sally forth and climb up easily. I went
into all sorts of places; armed with a great pole with
a spike at the end of it, like a leaping-pole, and with
pointed irons buckled on to my shoes; and am all but
knocked up. I was very anxious to make the expedition
to what is called 'The Garden:' a green spot
covered with wild flowers, lying across the Mer de
Glace, and among the most awful mountains: but I
could find no Englishman at the hotels who was similarly
disposed, and the Brave <i>wouldn't go</i>. No sir!
He gave in point blank (having been horribly blown
in a climbing excursion the day before), and couldn't
stand it. He is too heavy for such work, unquestionably.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
In all other respects, I think he has exceeded
himself on this journey; and if you could have seen
him riding a very small mule, up a road exactly like
the broken stairs of Rochester-castle; with a brandy
bottle slung over his shoulder, a small pie in his hat, a
roast fowl looking out of his pocket, and a mountain
staff of six feet long carried cross-wise on the saddle
before him; you'd have said so. He was (next to me)
the admiration of Chamounix, but he utterly quenched
me on the road."</p>

<p>On the road as they returned there had been a
small adventure, the day before this letter was written.
Dickens was jingling slowly up the T&ecirc;te Noire pass (his
mule having thirty-seven bells on its head), riding at
the moment quite alone, when&mdash;"an Englishman came
bolting out of a little ch&acirc;let in a most inaccessible and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_256" id="Page_2_256">[256]</a></span>
extraordinary place, and said with great glee 'There
has been an accident here sir!' I had been thinking
of anything else you please; and, having no reason
to suppose him an Englishman except his language,
which went for nothing in the confusion, stammered
out a reply in French and stared at him, in
a very damp shirt and trowsers, as he stared at me
in a similar costume. On his repeating the announcement,
I began to have a glimmering of common sense;
and so arrived at a knowledge of the fact that a German
lady had been thrown from her mule and had
broken her leg, at a short distance off, and had found
her way in great pain to that cottage, where the Englishman,
a Prussian, and a Frenchman, had presently
come up; and the Frenchman, by extraordinary good
fortune, was a surgeon! They were all from Chamounix,
and the three latter were walking in company.
It was quite charming to see how attentive they were.
The lady was from Lausanne; where she had come
from Frankfort to make excursions with her two boys,
who are at the college here, during the vacation. She
had no other attendants, and the boys were crying and
very frightened. The Englishman was in the full glee
of having just cut up one white dress, two chemises, and
three pocket handkerchiefs, for bandages; the Frenchman
had set the leg skilfully; the Prussian had scoured
a neighboring wood for some men to carry her forward;
and they were all at it, behind the hut, making a sort
of handbarrow on which to bear her. When it was
constructed, she was strapped upon it; had her poor
head covered over with a handkerchief, and was carried
away; and we all went on in company: Kate and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_257" id="Page_2_257">[257]</a></span>
Georgy consoling and tending the sufferer, who was
very cheerful, but had lost her husband only a year."
With the same delightful observation, and missing no
touch of kindly character that might give each actor
his place in the little scene, the sequel is described;
but it does not need to add more. It was hoped that
by means of relays of men at Martigny the poor lady
might have been carried on some twenty miles, in the
cooler evening, to the head of the lake, and so have
been got into the steamer; but she was too exhausted
to be borne beyond the inn, and there she had to
remain until joined by relatives from Frankfort.</p>

<p>A few days' rest after his return were interposed,
before he began his second number; and until the latter
has been completed, and the Christmas story taken
in hand, I do not admit the reader to his full confidences
about his writing. But there were other subjects
that amused and engaged him up to that date, as
well when he was idle as when again he was at work, to
which expression so full of character is given in his
letters that they properly find mention here.</p>

<p>Between the second and the ninth of August he went
down one evening to the lake, five minutes after sunset,
when the sky was covered with sullen black clouds
reflected in the deep water, and saw the Castle of
Chillon. He thought it the best deserving and least
exaggerated in repute, of all the places he had seen.
"The insupportable solitude and dreariness of the
white walls and towers, the sluggish moat and drawbridge,
and the lonely ramparts, I never saw the like
of. But there is a court-yard inside; surrounded by
prisons, oubliettes, and old chambers of torture; so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_258" id="Page_2_258">[258]</a></span>
terrifically sad, that death itself is not more sorrowful.
And oh! a wicked old Grand Duke's bedchamber
upstairs in the tower, with a secret staircase down into
the chapel, where the bats were wheeling about; and
Bonnivard's dungeon; and a horrible trap whence
prisoners were cast out into the lake; and a stake all
burnt and crackled up, that still stands in the torture-ante-chamber
to the saloon of justice (!)&mdash;what tremendous
places! Good God, the greatest mystery in
all the earth, to me, is how or why the world was
tolerated by its Creator through the good old times,
and wasn't dashed to fragments."</p>

<p>On the ninth of August he wrote to me that there was
to be a prodigious f&ecirc;te that day in Lausanne, in honour
of the first anniversary of the proclamation of the New
Constitution:<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> "beginning at sunrise with the firing of
great guns, and twice two thousand rounds of rifles by
two thousand men; proceeding at eleven o'clock with
a great service, and some speechifying, in the church;
and ending to-night with a great ball in the public
promenade, and a general illumination of the town."
The authorities had invited him to a place of honour in
the ceremony; and though he did not go ("having
been up till three o'clock in the morning, and being
fast asleep at the appointed time"), the reply that sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_259" id="Page_2_259">[259]</a></span>
his thanks expressed also his sympathy. He was the
readier with this from having discovered, in the "old"
or "gentlemanly" party of the place ("including of
course the sprinkling of English who are always tory,
hang 'em!"), so wonderfully sore a feeling about the
revolution thus celebrated, that to avoid its f&ecirc;te the
majority had gone off by steamer the day before, and
those who remained were prophesying assaults on the
unilluminated houses, and other excesses. Dickens had
no faith in such predictions. "The people are as perfectly
good tempered and quiet always, as people can
be. I don't know what the last Government may have
been, but they seem to me to do very well with this,
and to be rationally and cheaply provided for. If you
believed what the discontented assert, you wouldn't believe
in one solitary man or woman with a grain of
goodness or civility. I find nothing <i>but</i> civility; and
I walk about in all sorts of out-of-the-way places, where
they live rough lives enough, in solitary cottages." The
issue was told in two postscripts to his letter, and showed
him to be so far right. "P.S. 6 o'clock afternoon.
The f&ecirc;te going on, in great force. Not one of 'the old
party' to be seen. I went down with one to the ground
before dinner, and nothing would induce him to go
within the barrier with me. Yet what they call a revolution
was nothing but a change of government. Thirty-six
thousand people, in this small canton, petitioned
against the Jesuits&mdash;God knows with good reason. The
Government chose to call them 'a mob.' So, to prove
that they were not, they turned the Government out.
I honour them for it. They are a genuine people, these
Swiss. There is better metal in them than in all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_260" id="Page_2_260">[260]</a></span>
stars and stripes of all the fustian banners of the so-called,
and falsely called, U-nited States. They are a
thorn in the sides of European despots, and a good
wholesome people to live near Jesuit-ridden Kings on
the brighter side of the mountains." "P.P.S. August
10th.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The f&ecirc;te went off as quietly as I supposed
it would; and they danced all night."</p>

<p>These views had forcible illustration in a subsequent
letter, where he describes a similar revolution that
occurred at Geneva before he left the country; and
nothing could better show his practical good sense in a
matter of this kind. The description will be given
shortly; and meanwhile I subjoin a comment made by
him, not less worthy of attention, upon my reply to his
account of the anti-Jesuit celebration at Lausanne. "I
don't know whether I have mentioned before, that in
the valley of the Simplon hard by here, where (at the
bridge of St. Maurice, over the Rhone) this Protestant
canton ends and a Catholic canton begins, you might
separate two perfectly distinct and different conditions
of humanity by drawing a line with your stick in the
dust on the ground. On the Protestant side, neatness;
cheerfulness; industry; education; continual aspiration,
at least, after better things. On the Catholic
side, dirt, disease, ignorance, squalor, and misery. I
have so constantly observed the like of this, since I
first came abroad, that I have a sad misgiving that the
religion of Ireland lies as deep at the root of all its
sorrows, even as English misgovernment and Tory villainy."
Almost the counterpart of this remark is to
be found in one of the later writings of Macaulay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> sketches from the life in his pleasantest vein
now claim to be taken from the same series of letters;
and I will prefix one or two less important notices, for
the most part personal also, that have characteristic
mention of his opinions in them.</p>

<p>Home-politics he criticized in what he wrote on the
24th of August, much in the spirit of his last excellent
remark on the Protestant and Catholic cantons; having
no sympathy with the course taken by the whigs in
regard to Ireland after they had defeated Peel on his
coercion bill, and resumed the government. "I am
perfectly appalled by the hesitation and cowardice
of the whigs. To bring in that arms bill, bear the
brunt of the attack upon it, take out the obnoxious
clauses, still retain the bill, and finally withdraw it,
seems to me the meanest and most halting way of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_262" id="Page_2_262">[262]</a></span>
going to work that ever was taken. I cannot believe
in them. Lord John must be helpless among them.
They seem somehow or other never to know what
cards they hold in their hands, and to play them
out blindfold. The contrast with Peel (as he was
last) is, I agree with you, certainly not favourable. I
don't believe now they ever would have carried the
repeal of the corn law, if they could." Referring in
the same letter<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> to the reluctance of public men of all
parties to give the needful help to schemes of emigration,
he ascribed it to a secret belief "in the gentle
politico-economical principle that a surplus population
must and ought to starve;" in which for himself he
never could see anything but disaster for all who trusted
to it. "I am convinced that its philosophers would
sink any government, any cause, any doctrine, even the
most righteous. There is a sense and humanity in the
mass, in the long run, that will not bear them; and they
will wreck their friends always, as they wrecked them in
the working of the Poor-law-bill. Not all the figures
that Babbage's calculating machine could turn up in
twenty generations, would stand in the long run against
the general heart."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_263" id="Page_2_263">[263]</a></span></p>
<p>Of other topics in his letters, one or two have the
additional attractiveness derivable from touches of
personal interest when these may with propriety be
printed. Hardly within the class might have fallen a
mention of Mark Lemon, of whom our recent play,
and his dramatic adaptation of the <i>Chimes</i>, had given
him pleasant experiences, if I felt less strongly not only
that its publication would have been gladly sanctioned
by the subject of it, but that it will not now displease
another to whom also it refers, herself the member of a
family in various ways distinguished on the stage, and
to whom, since her husband's death, well-merited sympathy
and respect have been paid. "After turning
Mrs. Lemon's portrait over, in my mind, I am convinced
that there is not a grain of bad taste in the
matter, and that there is a manly composure and courage
in the proceeding deserving of the utmost respect.
If Lemon were one of your braggart honest men, he
would set a taint of bad taste upon that action as upon
everything else he might say or do; but being what he
is, I admire him for it greatly, and hold it to be a
proof of an exalted nature and a true heart. Your
idea of him, is mine. I am sure he is an excellent fellow.
We talk about not liking such and such a man because
he doesn't look one in the face,&mdash;but how much
we should esteem a man who looks the world in the
face, composedly, and neither shirks it nor bullies it.
Between ourselves, I say with shame and self-reproach
that I am quite sure if Kate had been a Columbine her
portrait would not be hanging, 'in character,' in
Devonshire-terrace."</p>

<p>He speaks thus of a novel by Hood. "I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_264" id="Page_2_264">[264]</a></span>
been reading poor Hood's <i>Tylney Hall;</i> the most extraordinary
jumble of impossible extravagance, and
especial cleverness, I ever saw. The man drawn to the
life from the pirate-bookseller, is wonderfully good;
and his recommendation to a reduced gentleman from
the university, to rise from nothing as he, the pirate,
did, and go round to the churches and see whether
there's an opening, and begin by being a beadle, is
one of the finest things I ever read, in its way." The
same letter has a gentle little trait of the great duke,
touching in its simplicity, and worth preserving. "I
had a letter from Tagart the day before yesterday, with
a curious little anecdote of the Duke of Wellington in
it. They have had a small cottage at Walmer; and
one day&mdash;the other day only&mdash;the old man met their
little daughter Lucy, a child about Mamey's age, near
the garden; and having kissed her, and asked her
what was her name, and who and what her parents
were, tied a small silver medal round her neck with a
bit of pink ribbon, and asked the child to keep it in
remembrance of him. There is something good, and
aged, and odd in it. Is there not?"</p>

<p>Another of his personal references was to Lord Grey,
to whose style of speaking and general character of
mind he had always a strongly-expressed dislike, drawn
not impartially or quite justly from the days of reaction
that followed the reform debates, when the whig
leader's least attractive traits were presented to the
young reporter. "He is a very intelligent agreeable
fellow, the said Watson by the bye" (he is speaking
of the member of the Lausanne circle with whom he
established friendliest after-intercourse); "he sat for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_265" id="Page_2_265">[265]</a></span>
Northamptonshire in the reform bill time, and is high
sheriff of his county and all the rest of it; but has
not the least nonsense about him, and is a thorough
good liberal. He has a charming wife, who draws
well, and is making a sketch of Rosemont for us that
shall be yours in Paris." (It is already, by permission
of its present possessor, the reader's, and all the world's
who may take interest in the little doll's house of
Lausanne which lodged so illustrious a tenant.) "He
was giving me some good recollections of Lord Grey
the other evening when we were playing at battledore
(old Lord Grey I mean), and of the constitutional
impossibility he and Lord Lansdowne and the rest
laboured under, of ever personally attaching a single
young man, in all the excitement of that exciting time,
to the leaders of the party. It was quite a delight to
me, as I listened, to recall my own dislike of his style
of speaking, his fishy coldness, his uncongenial and
unsympathetic politeness, and his insufferable though
most gentlemanly artificiality. The shape of his head
(I see it now) was misery to me, and weighed down
my youth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>It was now the opening of the second week in
August; and before he finally addressed himself to the
second number of <i>Dombey</i>, he had again turned a
lingering look in the direction of his Christmas book.
"It would be such a great relief to me to get that
small story out of the way." Wisely, however, again
he refrained, and went on with <i>Dombey;</i> at which he
had been working for a little time when he described
to me (24th of August) a visit from two English travellers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_266" id="Page_2_266">[266]</a></span>
of one of whom with the slightest possible touch
he gives a speaking likeness.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>"Not having your letter as usual, I sat down to
write to you on speculation yesterday, but lapsed in
my uncertainty into <i>Dombey</i>, and worked at it all day.
It was, as it has been since last Tuesday morning,
incessantly raining regular mountain rain. After dinner,
at a little after seven o'clock, I was walking up and
down under the little colonnade in the garden, racking
my brain about <i>Dombeys</i> and <i>Battles of Lives</i>, when
two travel-stained-looking men approached, of whom
one, in a very limp and melancholy straw hat, ducked,
perpetually to me as he came up the walk. I couldn't
make them out at all; and it wasn't till I got close up
to them that I recognised A. and (in the straw hat) N.
They had come from Geneva by the steamer, and taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_267" id="Page_2_267">[267]</a></span>
a scrambling dinner on board. I gave them some fine
Rhine wine, and cigars innumerable. A. enjoyed himself
and was quite at home. N. (an odd companion
for a man of genius) was snobbish, but pleased and
good-natured. A. had a five pound note in his pocket
which he had worn down, by careless carrying about,
to some two-thirds of its original size, and which was
so ragged in its remains that when he took it out bits
of it flew about the table. 'Oh Lor you know&mdash;now
really&mdash;like Goldsmith you know&mdash;or any of those
great men!' said N. with the very 'snatches in his
voice and burst of speaking' that reminded Leigh Hunt
of Cloten.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The clouds were lying, as they do in
such weather here, on the earth, and our friends saw
no more of Lake Leman than of Battersea. Nor had
they, it might appear, seen more of the Mer de Glace,
on their way here; their talk about it bearing much
resemblance to that of the man who had been to
Niagara and said it was nothing but water."</p>

<p>His next letter described a day's party of the Cerjats,
Watsons, and Haldimands, among the neighbouring
hills, which, contrary to his custom while at work, he
had been unable to resist the temptation of joining.
They went to a mountain-lake twelve miles off, had
dinner at the public-house on the lake, and returned
home by Vevay at which they rested for tea; and where
pleasant talk with Mr. Cerjat led to anecdotes of an
excellent friend of ours, formerly resident at Lausanne,
with which the letter closed. Our friend was a distinguished
writer, and a man of many sterling fine
qualities, but with a habit of occasional free indulgence
in coarseness of speech, which, though his earlier life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_268" id="Page_2_268">[268]</a></span>
had made it as easy to acquire as difficult to drop, did
always less than justice to a very manly, honest, and
really gentle nature. He had as much genuinely admirable
stuff in him as any favourite hero of Smollett
or Fielding, and I never knew anyone who reminded
me of those characters so much. "It would seem, Mr.
Cerjat tells me, that he was, when here, infinitely worse
in his general style of conversation, than now&mdash;sermuchser,
as Toodles says, that Cerjat describes himself
as having always been in unspeakable agony when he
was at his table, lest he should forget himself (or remember
himself, as I suggested) and break out before
the ladies. There happened to be living here at that
time a stately English baronet and his wife, who had
two milksop sons, concerning whom they cherished the
idea of accomplishing their education into manhood
coexistently with such perfect purity and innocence,
that they were hardly to know their own sex. Accordingly,
they were sent to no school or college, but had
masters of all sorts at home, and thus reached eighteen
years or so, in what Falstaff calls a kind of male green-sickness.
At this crisis of their innocent existence,
our ogre friend encountered these lambs at dinner,
with their father, at Cerjat's house; and, as if possessed
by a devil, launched out into such frightful and appalling
impropriety&mdash;ranging over every kind of forbidden
topic and every species of forbidden word and every
sort of scandalous anecdote&mdash;that years of education in
Newgate would have been as nothing compared with
their experience of that one afternoon. After turning
paler and paler, and more and more stoney, the baronet,
with a half-suppressed cry, rose and fled. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_269" id="Page_2_269">[269]</a></span>
sons&mdash;intent on the ogre&mdash;remained behind instead of
following him; and are supposed to have been ruined
from that hour. Isn't that a good story? I can <span class="smcap">see</span>
our friend and his pupils now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Poor fellow! He
seems to have a hard time of it with his wife. She
had no interest whatever in her children; and was
such a fury, that, being dressed to go out to dinner,
she would sometimes, on no other provocation than a
pin out of its place or some such thing, fall upon a
little maid she had, beat her till she couldn't stand,
then tumble into hysterics, and be carried to bed. He
suffered martyrdom with her; and seems to have been
himself, in all good-natured easy-going ways, just what
we know him now."</p>

<p>There were at this time some fresh arrivals of travelling
English at Lausanne, outside their own little
circle, and among them another baronet and his
family made amusing appearance. "We have another
English family here, one Sir Joseph and his lady, and
ten children. Sir Joseph, a large baronet something
in the Graham style, with a little, loquacious, flat-faced,
damaged-featured, <i>old young</i> wife. They are
fond of society, and couldn't well have less. They
delight in a view, and live in a close street at Ouchy,
down among the drunken boatmen and the drays and
omnibuses, where nothing whatever is to be seen but the
locked wheels of carts scraping down the uneven,
steep, stone pavement. The baronet plays double-dummy
all day long, with an unhappy Swiss whom he
has entrapped for that purpose; the baronet's lady
pays visits; and the baronet's daughters play a Lausanne
piano, which must be heard to be appreciated.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_270" id="Page_2_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Another sketch in the same letter touches little more
than the eccentricities (but all in good taste and good
humour) of the subject of it, who is still gratefully remembered
by English residents in Italy for his scholarly
munificence, and for very valuable service conferred
by it on Italian literature. "Another curious man is
backwards and forwards here&mdash;a Lord Vernon,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> who is
well-informed, a great Italian scholar deep in Dante,
and a very good-humoured gentleman, but who has
fallen into the strange infatuation of attending every
rifle-match that takes place in Switzerland, accompanied
by two men who load rifles for him, one after another,
which he has been frequently known to fire off, two a
minute, for fourteen hours at a stretch, without once
changing his position or leaving the ground. He wins
all kinds of prizes; gold watches, flags, teaspoons, tea-boards,
and so forth; and is constantly travelling about
with them, from place to place, in an extraordinary
carriage, where you touch a spring and a chair flies out,
touch another spring and a bed appears, touch another
spring and a closet of pickles opens, touch another
spring and disclose a pantry. While Lady Vernon
(said to be handsome and accomplished) is continually
cutting across this or that Alpine pass in the night, to
meet him on the road, for a minute or two, on one of
his excursions; these being the only times at which she
can catch him. The last time he saw her, was five or
six months ago, when they met and supped together on
the St. Gothard! It is a monomania with him, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_271" id="Page_2_271">[271]</a></span>
course. He is a man of some note; seconded one of
Lord Melbourne's addresses; and had forty thousand a
year, now reduced to ten, but nursing and improving
every day. He was with us last Monday, and comes
back from some out-of-the-way place to join another
small picnic next Friday. As I have said, he is the
very soul of good nature and cheerfulness, but one can't
help being melancholy to see a man wasting his life in
such a singular delusion. Isn't it odd? He knows my
books very well, and seems interested in everything
concerning them; being indeed accomplished in books
generally, and attached to many elegant tastes."</p>

<p>But the most agreeable addition to their own special
circle was referred to in his first September letter, just
when he was coming to the close of his second number
of <i>Dombey</i>. "There are two nice girls here, the Ladies
Taylor, daughters of Lord Headfort. Their mother
was daughter (I think) of Sir John Stevenson, and
Moore dedicated one part of the Irish Melodies to her.
They inherit the musical taste, and sing very well. A
proposal is on foot for our all bundling off on Tuesday
(16 strong) to the top of the Great St. Bernard. But
the weather seems to have broken, and the autumn
rains to have set in; which I devoutly hope will break
up the party. It would be a most serious hindrance to
me, just now; but I have rashly promised. Do you
know young Romilly? He is coming over from Geneva
when 'the reading' comes off, and is a fine fellow I am
told. There is not a bad little theatre here; and by
way of an artificial crowd, I should certainly have got
it open with an amateur company, if we were not so
few that the only thing we want is the audience."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_272" id="Page_2_272">[272]</a></span>
The "reading" named by him was that of his first
number, which was to "come off" as soon as I could
get the proofs out to him; but which the changes
needful to be made, and to be mentioned hereafter,
still delayed. The St. Bernard holiday, which within
sight of his Christmas-book labour he would fain have
thrown over, came off as proposed very fortunately for
the reader, who might otherwise have lost one of his
pleasantest descriptions. But before giving it, one more
little sketch of character may be interposed as delicately
done as anything in his writings. Steele's observation
is in the outline, and Charles Lamb's humour in its
touch of colouring.</p>

<p>"&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There are two old ladies (English) living
here who may serve me for a few lines of gossip&mdash;as I
have intended they should, over and over again, but
I have always forgotten it. There were originally four
old ladies, sisters, but two of them have faded away
in the course of eighteen years, and withered by the
side of John Kemble in the cemetery. They are very
little, and very skinny; and each of them wears a row
of false curls, like little rolling-pins, so low upon her
brow, that there is no forehead; nothing above the
eyebrows but a deep horizontal wrinkle, and then the
curls. They live upon some small annuity. For thirteen
years they have wanted very much to move to
Italy, as the eldest old lady says the climate of this
part of Switzerland doesn't agree with her, and preys
upon her spirits; but they have never been able to go,
because of the difficulty of moving 'the books.' This
tremendous library belonged once upon a time to the
father of these old ladies, and comprises about fifty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_273" id="Page_2_273">[273]</a></span>
volumes. I have never been able to see what they
are, because one of the old ladies always sits before
them; but they look, outside, like very old backgammon-boards.
The two deceased sisters died in the
firm persuasion that this precious property could never
be got over the Simplon without some gigantic effort
to which the united family was unequal. The two
remaining sisters live, and will die also, in the same
belief. I met the eldest (evidently drooping) yesterday,
and recommended her to try Genoa. She looked
shrewdly at the snow that closes up the mountain prospect
just now, and said that when the spring was quite
set in, and the avalanches were down, and the passes
well open, she would certainly try that place, if they
could devise any plan, in the course of the winter, for
moving 'the books.' The whole library will be sold
by auction here, when they are both dead, for about
a napoleon; and some young woman will carry it home
in two journeys with a basket."</p>

<p>The last letter sent me before he fell upon his self-appointed
task for Christmas, contained a delightful
account of the trip to the Great St. Bernard. It was
dated on the sixth of September.</p>

<p>"The weather obstinately clearing, we started off
last Tuesday for the Great St. Bernard, returning here
on Friday afternoon. The party consisted of eleven
people and two servants&mdash;Haldimand, Mr. and Mrs.
Cerjat and one daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Watson, two
Ladies Taylor, Kate, Georgy, and I. We were wonderfully
unanimous and cheerful; went away from here by
the steamer; found at its destination a whole omnibus
provided by the Brave (who went on in advance everywhere);<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_274" id="Page_2_274">[274]</a></span>
rode therein to Bex; found two large carriages
ready to take us to Martigny; slept there; and proceeded
up the mountain on mules next day. Although
the St. Bernard convent is, as I dare say you know,
the highest inhabited spot but one in the world, the
ascent is extremely gradual and uncommonly easy:
really presenting no difficulties at all, until within the
last league, when the ascent, lying through a place
called the valley of desolation, is very awful and tremendous,
and the road is rendered toilsome by scattered
rocks and melting snow. The convent is a most
extraordinary place, full of great vaulted passages,
divided from each other with iron gratings; and presenting
a series of the most astonishing little dormitories,
where the windows are so small (on account of
the cold and snow), that it is as much as one can do
to get one's head out of them. Here we slept: supping,
thirty strong, in a rambling room with a great
wood-fire in it set apart for that purpose; with a grim
monk, in a high black sugar-loaf hat with a great knob
at the top of it, carving the dishes. At five o'clock
in the morning the chapel bell rang in the dismallest
way for matins: and I, lying in bed close to the
chapel, and being awakened by the solemn organ and
the chaunting, thought for a moment I had died in the
night and passed into the unknown world.</p>

<p>"I wish to God you could see that place. A great
hollow on the top of a range of dreadful mountains,
fenced in by riven rocks of every shape and colour:
and in the midst, a black lake, with phantom clouds
perpetually stalking over it. Peaks, and points, and
plains of eternal ice and snow, bounding the view, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_275" id="Page_2_275">[275]</a></span>
shutting out the world on every side: the lake reflecting
nothing: and no human figure in the scene. The
air so fine, that it is difficult to breathe without feeling
out of breath; and the cold so exquisitely thin and
sharp that it is not to be described. Nothing of life or
living interest in the picture, but the grey dull walls
of the convent. No vegetation of any sort or kind.
Nothing growing, nothing stirring. Everything iron-bound,
and frozen up. Beside the convent, in a little
outhouse with a grated iron door which you may unbolt
for yourself, are the bodies of people found in the
snow who have never been claimed and are withering
away&mdash;not laid down, or stretched out, but standing
up, in corners and against walls; some erect and horribly
human, with distinct expressions on the faces;
some sunk down on their knees; some dropping over on
one side; some tumbled down altogether, and presenting
a heap of skulls and fibrous dust. There is no
other decay in that atmosphere; and there they remain
during the short days and the long nights, the only
human company out of doors, withering away by grains,
and holding ghastly possession of the mountain where
they died.</p>

<p>"It is the most distinct and individual place I have
seen, even in this transcendent country. But, for the
Saint Bernard holy fathers and convent in themselves,
I am sorry to say that they are a piece of as sheer humbug
as we ever learnt to believe in, in our young days.
Trashy French sentiment and the dogs (of which, by
the bye, there are only three remaining) have done it
all. They are a lazy set of fellows; not over fond of
going out themselves; employing servants to clear the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_276" id="Page_2_276">[276]</a></span>
road (which has not been important or much used as a
pass these hundred years); rich; and driving a good
trade in Innkeeping: the convent being a common
tavern in everything but the sign. No charge is made
for their hospitality, to be sure; but you are shown to
a box in the chapel, where everybody puts in more
than could, with any show of face, be charged for the
entertainment; and from this the establishment derives
a right good income. As to the self-sacrifice of
living up there, they are obliged to go there young, it
is true, to be inured to the climate: but it is an infinitely
more exciting and various life than any other
convent can offer; with constant change and company
through the whole summer; with a hospital for invalids
down in the valley, which affords another change; and
with an annual begging-journey to Geneva and this
place and all the places round for one brother or
other, which affords farther change. The brother who
carved at our supper could speak some English, and
had just had <i>Pickwick</i> given him!&mdash;what a humbug he
will think me when he tries to understand it! If I
had had any other book of mine with me, I would have
given it him, that I might have had some chance of
being intelligible.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Something</span> of the other side of the medal has now
to be presented. His letters enable us to see him
amid his troubles and difficulties of writing, as faithfully
as in his leisure and enjoyments; and when, to
the picture thus given of Dickens's home life in Switzerland,
some account has been added of the vicissitudes
of literary labour undergone in the interval, as complete
a representation of the man will be afforded as
could be taken from any period of his career. Of the
larger life whereof it is part, the Lausanne life is indeed
a perfect microcosm, wanting only the London
streets. This was his chief present want, as will shortly
be perceived: but as yet the reader does not feel it,
and he sees otherwise in all respects at his best the
great observer and humourist; interested in everything
that commended itself to a thoroughly earnest and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_278" id="Page_2_278">[278]</a></span>
eagerly enquiring nature; popular beyond measure
with all having intercourse with him; the centre, and
very soul, of social enjoyment; letting nothing escape
a vision that was not more keen than kindly; and even
when apparently most idle, never idle in the sense of
his art, but adding day by day to experiences that
widened its range, and gave freer and healthier play to
an imagination always busily at work, alert and active
in a singular degree, and that seemed to be quite untiring.
At his heart there was a genuine love of nature
at all times; and strange as it may seem to connect
this with such forms of humorous delineation as are
most identified with his genius, it is yet the literal
truth that the impressions of this noble Swiss scenery
were with him during the work of many subsequent
years: a present and actual, though it might be seldom
a directly conscious, influence. When he said afterwards,
that, while writing the book on which he is now
engaged, he had not seen less clearly each step of the
wooden midshipman's staircase, each pew of the church
in which Florence was married, or each bed in the dormitory
of Doctor Blimber's establishment, because he
was himself at the time by the lake of Geneva, he
might as truly have said that he saw them all the more
clearly even because of that circumstance. He worked
his humour to its greatest results by the freedom and
force of his imagination; and while the smallest or
commonest objects around him were food for the one,
the other might have pined or perished without additional
higher aliment. Dickens had little love for
Wordsworth, but he was himself an example of the
truth the great poet never tired of enforcing, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_279" id="Page_2_279">[279]</a></span>
Nature has subtle helps for all who are admitted to
become free of her wonders and mysteries.</p>

<p>Another noticeable thing in him is impressed upon
these letters, as upon many also heretofore quoted, for
indeed all of them are marvellously exact in the reproduction
of his nature. He did not think lightly of his
work; and the work that occupied him at the time was
for the time paramount with him. But the sense he
entertained, whether right or wrong, of the importance
of what he had to do, of the degree to which it concerned
others that the power he held should be exercised
successfully, and of the estimate he was justified in forming
as the fair measure of its worth or greatness, does
not carry with it of necessity presumption or self-conceit.
Few men have had less of either. It was part
of the intense individuality by which he effected so
much, to set the high value which in general he did
upon what he was striving to accomplish; he could not
otherwise have mastered one half the work he designed;
and we are able to form an opinion, more just now for
ourselves than it might have seemed to us then from
others, of the weight and truth of such self-judgment.
The fussy pretension of small men in great places, and
the resolute self-assertion of great men in small places,
are things essentially different. <i>Respice finem</i>. The
exact relative importance of all our pursuits is to be
arrived at by nicer adjustments of the Now and the
Hereafter than are possible to contemporary judgments;
and there have been some indications since his death
confirmatory of the belief, that the estimate which he
thought himself entitled to form of the labours to which
his life was devoted, will be strengthened, not lessened,
by time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_280" id="Page_2_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Dickens proposed to himself, it will be remembered,
to write at Lausanne not only the first four numbers of
his larger book, but the Christmas book suggested to
him by his fancy of a battle field; and reserving what
is to be said of <i>Dombey</i> to a later chapter, this and its
successor will deal only with what he finished as well
as began in Switzerland, and will show at what cost
even so much was achieved amid his other and larger
engagements.</p>

<p>He had restless fancies and misgivings before he
settled to his first notion. "I have been thinking
this last day or two," he wrote on the 25th of July,
"that good Christmas characters might be grown out
of the idea of a man imprisoned for ten or fifteen
years; his imprisonment being the gap between the
people and circumstances of the first part and the
altered people and circumstances of the second, and
his own changed mind. Though I shall probably proceed
with the Battle idea, I should like to know what
you think of this one?" It was afterwards used in a
modified shape for the <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>. "I shall
begin the little story straightway," he wrote a few
weeks later; "but I have been dimly conceiving a
very ghostly and wild idea, which I suppose I must now
reserve for the <i>next</i> Christmas book. <i>Nous verrons.</i>
It will mature in the streets of Paris by night, as well
as in London." This took ultimately the form of the
<i>Haunted Man</i>, which was not written until the winter
of 1848. At last I knew that his first slip was done,
and that even his eager busy fancy would not turn him
back again.</p>

<p>But other unsatisfied wants and cravings had meanwhile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_281" id="Page_2_281">[281]</a></span>
broken out in him, of which I heard near the
close of the second number of <i>Dombey</i>. The first he
had finished at the end of July; and the second, which
he began on the 8th of August, he was still at work
upon in the first week of September, when this remarkable
announcement came to me. It was his first detailed
confession of what he felt so continuously, and
if that were possible even more strongly, as the years
went on, that there is no single passage in any of his
letters which throws such a flood of illuminative light
into the portions of his life which always awaken the
greatest interest. Very much that is to follow must be
read by it. "You can hardly imagine," he wrote on
the 30th of August, "what infinite pains I take, or
what extraordinary difficulty I find in getting on <span class="smcap">fast</span>.
Invention, thank God, seems the easiest thing in the
world; and I seem to have such a preposterous sense
of the ridiculous, after this long rest" (it was now
over two years since the close of <i>Chuzzlewit</i>), "as to
be constantly requiring to restrain myself from launching
into extravagances in the height of my enjoyment.
But the difficulty of going at what I call a rapid pace,
is prodigious; it is almost an impossibility. I suppose
this is partly the effect of two years' ease, and partly
of the absence of streets and numbers of figures. I can't
express how much I want these. It seems as if they
supplied something to my brain, which it cannot bear,
when busy, to lose. For a week or a fortnight I can
write prodigiously in a retired place (as at Broadstairs),
and a day in London sets me up again and starts me.
But the toil and labour of writing, day after day, without
that magic lantern, is <span class="smcap">immense</span>!! I don't say this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_282" id="Page_2_282">[282]</a></span>
at all in low spirits, for we are perfectly comfortable
here, and I like the place very much indeed, and the
people are even more friendly and fond of me than
they were in Genoa. I only mention it as a curious
fact, which I have never had an opportunity of finding
out before. <i>My</i> figures seem disposed to stagnate without
crowds about them. I wrote very little in Genoa
(only the <i>Chimes</i>), and fancied myself conscious of
some such influence there&mdash;but Lord! I had two miles
of streets at least, lighted at night, to walk about in;
and a great theatre to repair to, every night." At the
close of the letter he told me that he had pretty well
matured the general idea of the Christmas book, and
was burning to get to work on it. He thought it would
be all the better, for a change, to have no fairies or
spirits in it, but to make it a simple domestic tale.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>In less than a week from this date his second number
was finished, his first slip of the little book done, and
his confidence greater. They had had wonderful
weather,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> so clear that he could see from the Neuch&acirc;tel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_283" id="Page_2_283">[283]</a></span>
road the whole of Mont Blanc, six miles distant, as
plainly as if he were standing close under it in the
courtyard of the little inn at Chamounix; and, though
again it was raining when he wrote, his "nailed shoes"
were by him and his "great waterproof cloak" in
preparation for a "fourteen-mile walk" before dinner.
Then, after three days more, came something of a
sequel to the confession before made, which will be
read with equal interest. "The absence of any accessible
streets continues to worry me, now that I have so
much to do, in a most singular manner. It is quite a
little mental phenomenon. I should not walk in them
in the day time, if they were here, I dare say: but at
night I want them beyond description. I don't seem
able to get rid of my spectres unless I can lose them in
crowds. However, as you say, there are streets in
Paris, and good suggestive streets too: and trips to
London will be nothing then. <span class="smcap">When</span> I have finished
the Christmas book, I shall fly to Geneva for a day or
two, before taking up with <i>Dombey</i> again. I like this
place better and better; and never saw, I think, more
agreeable people than our little circle is made up of.
It is so little, that one is not 'bothered' in the least;
and their interest in the inimitable seems to strengthen
daily. I read them the first number last night 'was a'
week, with unrelateable success; and old Mrs. Marcet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_284" id="Page_2_284">[284]</a></span>
who is devilish 'cute, guessed directly (but I didn't tell
her she was right) that little Paul would die. They
were all so apprehensive that it was a great pleasure to
read it; and I shall leave here, if all goes well, in a
brilliant shower of sparks struck out of them by the
promised reading of the Christmas book." Little did
either of us then imagine to what these readings were
to lead, but even thus early they were taking in his
mind the shape of a sort of jest that the smallest opportunity
of favour might have turned into earnest.
In his very next letter he wrote to me: "I was thinking
the other day that in these days of lecturings and
readings, a great deal of money might possibly be
made (if it were not infra dig) by one's having Readings
of one's own books. It would be an <i>odd</i> thing.
I think it would take immensely. What do you say?
Will you step to Dean-street, and see how Miss Kelly's
engagement-book (it must be an immense volume!)
stands? Or shall I take the St. James's?" My answer
is to be inferred from his rejoinder: but even at this
time, while heightening and carrying forward his jest,
I suspected him of graver desires than he cared to
avow; and the time was to come, after a dozen years,
when with earnestness equal to his own I continued to
oppose, for reasons to be stated in their place, that
which he had set his heart upon too strongly to abandon,
and which I still can only wish he had preferred
to surrender with all that seemed to be its enormous
gains! "I don't think you have exercised your usual
judgment in taking Covent-garden for me. I doubt it
is too large for my purpose. However, I shall stand
by whatever you propose to the proprietors."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_285" id="Page_2_285">[285]</a></span></p>
<p>Soon came the changes of trouble and vexation I had
too surely seen. "You remember," he wrote, "your
objection about the two stories. I made over light of
it. I ought to have considered that I have never
before really tried the opening of two together&mdash;having
always had one pretty far ahead when I have been
driving a pair of them. I know it all now. The
apparent impossibility of getting each into its place,
coupled with that craving for streets, so thoroughly put
me off the track, that, up to Wednesday or Thursday
last, I really contemplated, at times, the total abandonment
of the Christmas book this year, and the limitation
of my labours to <i>Dombey and Son!</i> I cancelled
the beginning of a first scene&mdash;which I have never
done before&mdash;and, with a notion in my head, ran
wildly about and about it, and could not get the idea
into any natural socket. At length, thank Heaven, I
nailed it all at once; and after going on comfortably
up to yesterday, and working yesterday from half-past
nine to six, I was last night in such a state of enthusiasm
about it that I think I was an inch or two taller.
I am a little cooler to-day, with a headache to boot;
but I really begin to hope you will think it a pretty
story, with some delicate notions in it agreeably presented,
and with a good human Christmas groundwork.
I fancy I see a great domestic effect in the last
part."</p>

<p>That was written on the 20th of September; but
six days later changed the picture and surprised me
not a little. I might grudge the space thus given to
one of the least important of his books but that the
illustration goes farther than the little tale it refers to,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_286" id="Page_2_286">[286]</a></span>
and is a picture of him in his moods of writing, with
their weakness as well as strength upon him, of a perfect
truth and applicability to every period of his life.
Movement and change while he was working were not
mere restlessness, as we have seen; it was no impatience
of labour, or desire of pleasure, that led at such
times to his eager craving for the fresh crowds and
faces in which he might lose or find the creatures
of his fancy; and recollecting this, much hereafter
will be understood that might else be very far
from clear, in regard to the sensitive conditions under
which otherwise he carried on these exertions of his
brain. "I am going to write you" (26th of September)
"a most startling piece of intelligence. I fear
there may be <span class="smcap">no Christmas Book</span>! I would give the
world to be on the spot to tell you this. Indeed I
once thought of starting for London to-night. I have
written nearly a third of it. It promises to be pretty;
quite a new idea in the story, I hope; but to manage
it without the supernatural agency now impossible of
introduction, and yet to move it naturally within the
required space, or with any shorter limit than a <i>Vicar
of Wakefield</i>, I find to be a difficulty so perplexing&mdash;the
past <i>Dombey</i> work taken into account&mdash;that I am
fearful of wearing myself out if I go on, and not being
able to come back to the greater undertaking with the
necessary freshness and spirit. If I had nothing but
the Christmas book to do, I <span class="smcap">would</span> do it; but I get
horrified and distressed beyond conception at the prospect
of being jaded when I come back to the other,
and making it a mere race against time. I have written
the first part; I know the end and upshot of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_287" id="Page_2_287">[287]</a></span>
second; and the whole of the third (there are only
three in all). I know the purport of each character,
and the plain idea that each is to work out; and I have
the principal effects sketched on paper. It cannot end
<i>quite</i> happily, but will end cheerfully and pleasantly.
But my soul sinks before the commencement of the
second part&mdash;the longest&mdash;and the introduction of the
under-idea. (The main one already developed, with
interest.) I don't know how it is. I suppose it is the
having been almost constantly at work in this quiet
place; and the dread for the <i>Dombey;</i> and the not
being able to get rid of it, in noise and bustle. The
beginning two books together is also, no doubt, a fruitful
source of the difficulty; for I am now sure I could
not have invented the <i>Carol</i> at the commencement of
the <i>Chuzzlewit</i>, or gone to a new book from the <i>Chimes</i>.
But this is certain. I am sick, giddy, and capriciously
despondent. I have bad nights; am full of disquietude
and anxiety; and am constantly haunted by the idea
that I am wasting the marrow of the larger book, and
ought to be at rest. One letter that I wrote you before
this, I have torn up. In that the Christmas book was
wholly given up for this year: but I now resolve to
make one effort more. I will go to Geneva to-morrow,
and try on Monday and Tuesday whether I can get on
at all bravely, in the changed scene. If I cannot, I am
convinced that I had best hold my hand at once; and
not fritter my spirits and hope away, with that long
book before me. You may suppose that the matter is
very grave when I can so nearly abandon anything in
which I am deeply interested, and fourteen or fifteen
close MS. pages of which, that have made me laugh and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_288" id="Page_2_288">[288]</a></span>
cry, are lying in my desk. Writing this letter at all, I
have a great misgiving that the letter I shall write you
on Tuesday night will not make it better. Take it, for
Heaven's sake, as an extremely serious thing, and not
a fancy of the moment. Last Saturday after a very
long day's work, and last Wednesday after finishing
the first part, I was full of eagerness and pleasure. At
all other times since I began, I have been brooding
and brooding over the idea that it was a wild thing to
dream of, ever: and that I ought to be at rest for the
<i>Dombey</i>."</p>

<p>The letter came, written on Wednesday not Tuesday
night, and it left the question still unsettled. "When
I came here" (Geneva, 30th of September) "I had a
bloodshot eye; and my head was so bad, with a pain
across the brow, that I thought I must have got cupped.
I have become a great deal better, however, and feel
quite myself again to-day.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I still have not made
up my mind as to what I <span class="smcap">can</span> do with the Christmas
book. I would give any money that it were possible
to consult with you. I have begun the second part this
morning, and have done a very fair morning's work at
it, but I do not feel it <i>in hand</i> within the necessary space
and divisions: and I have a great uneasiness in the
prospect of falling behind hand with the other labour,
which is so transcendantly important. I feel quite sure
that unless I (being in reasonably good state and spirits)
like the Christmas book myself, I had better not go on
with it; but had best keep my strength for <i>Dombey</i>,
and keep my number in advance. On the other hand
I am dreadfully averse to abandoning it, and am so torn
between the two things that I know not what to do. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_289" id="Page_2_289">[289]</a></span>
is impossible to express the wish I have that I could
take counsel with you. Having begun the second part
I will go on here, to-morrow and Friday (Saturday, the
Talfourds come to us at Lausanne, leaving on Monday
morning), unless I see new reason to give it up in the
meanwhile. Let it stand thus&mdash;that my next Monday's
letter shall finally decide the question. But if you have
not already told Bradbury and Evans of my last letter
I think it will now be best to do so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This non-publication
of a Christmas book, if it must be, I try to
think light of with the greater story just begun, and
with this <i>Battle of Life</i> story (of which I really think
the leading idea is very pretty) lying by me, for future
use. But I would like you to consider, in the event of
my not going on, how best, by timely announcement,
in November's or December's <i>Dombey</i>, I may seem to
hold the ground prospectively.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Heaven send me
a good deliverance! If I don't do it, it will be the
first time I ever abandoned anything I had once taken
in hand; and I shall not have abandoned it until after
a most desperate fight. I could do it, but for the
<i>Dombey</i>, as easily as I did last year or the year before.
But I cannot help falling back on that continually:
and this, combined with the peculiar difficulties of the
story for a Christmas book, and my being out of sorts,
discourages me sadly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Kate is here, and sends her
love."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A postscript was added on the following
day. "Georgy has come over from Lausanne, and
joins with Kate, &amp;c. &amp;c. My head remains greatly
better. My eye is recovering its old hue of beautiful
white, tinged with celestial blue. If I hadn't come
here, I think I should have had some bad low fever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_290" id="Page_2_290">[290]</a></span>
The sight of the rushing Rhone seemed to stir my blood
again. I don't think I shall want to be cupped, this
bout; but it looked, at one time, worse than I have
confessed to you. If I have any return, I will have it
done immediately."</p>

<p>He stayed two days longer at Geneva, which he found
to be a very good place; pleasantly reporting himself
as quite dismayed at first by the sight of gas in it, and
as trembling at the noise in its streets, which he pronounced
to be fully equal to the uproar of Richmond
in Surrey; but deriving from it some sort of benefit
both in health and in writing. So far his trip had been
successful, though he had to leave the place hurriedly
to welcome his English visitors to Rosemont.</p>

<p>One social and very novel experience he had in his
hotel, however, the night before he left, which may be
told before he hastens back to Lausanne; for it could
hardly now offend any one even if the names were
given. "And now sir I will describe, modestly, tamely,
literally, the visit to the small select circle which I
promised should make your hair stand on end. In our
hotel were Lady A, and Lady B, mother and daughter,
who came to the Peschiere shortly before we left it,
and who have a deep admiration for your humble servant
the inimitable B. They are both very clever.
Lady B, extremely well-informed in languages, living
and dead; books, and gossip; very pretty; with two
little children, and not yet five and twenty. Lady A,
plump, fresh, and rosy; matronly, but full of spirits
and good looks. Nothing would serve them but we
<i>must</i> dine with them; and accordingly, on Friday at
six, we went down to their room. I knew them to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_291" id="Page_2_291">[291]</a></span>
rather odd. For instance, I have known Lady A, <i>full
dressed</i>, walk alone through the streets of Genoa, the
squalid Italian bye streets, to the Governor's soir&eacute;e;
and announce herself at the palace of state, by knocking
at the door. I have also met Lady B, full dressed,
without any cap or bonnet, walking a mile to the opera,
with all sorts of jingling jewels about her, beside
a sedan chair in which sat enthroned her mama.
Consequently, I was not surprised at such little sparkles
in the conversation (from the young lady) as 'Oh God
what a sermon we had here, last Sunday!' 'And did
you ever read such infernal trash as Mrs. Gore's?'&mdash;and
the like. Still, but for Kate and Georgy (who
were decidedly in the way, as we agreed afterwards), I
should have thought it all very funny; and, as it was,
I threw the ball back again, was mighty free and easy,
made some rather broad jokes, and was highly applauded.
'You smoke, don't you?' said the young
lady, in a pause of this kind of conversation. 'Yes,' I
said, 'I generally take a cigar after dinner when I am
alone.' 'I'll give you a good 'un,' said she, 'when
we go up-stairs.' Well sir, in due course we went up
stairs, and there we were joined by an American lady
residing in the same hotel, who looked like what we
call in old England 'a reg'lar Bunter'&mdash;fluffy face
(rouged); considerable development of figure; one
groggy eye; blue satin dress made low with short
sleeves, and shoes of the same. Also a daughter; face
likewise fluffy; figure likewise developed; dress likewise
low, with short sleeves, and shoes of the same;
and one eye not yet actually groggy, but going to be.
American lady married at sixteen; daughter sixteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_292" id="Page_2_292">[292]</a></span>
now, often mistaken for sisters, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. When
that was over, Lady B brought out a cigar box, and
gave me a cigar, made of negrohead she said, which
would quell an elephant in six whiffs. The box was
full of cigarettes&mdash;good large ones, made of pretty
strong tobacco; I always smoke them here, and used
to smoke them at Genoa, and I knew them well.
When I lighted my cigar, Lady B lighted hers, at
mine; leaned against the mantelpiece, in conversation
with me; put out her stomach, folded her arms, and
with her pretty face cocked up sideways and her cigarette
smoking away like a Manchester cotton mill,
laughed, and talked, and smoked, in the most gentlemanly
manner I ever beheld. Lady A immediately
lighted her cigar; American lady immediately lighted
hers; and in five minutes the room was a cloud of
smoke, with us four in the centre pulling away bravely,
while American lady related stories of her 'Hookah'
up stairs, and described different kinds of pipes. But
even this was not all. For presently two Frenchmen
came in, with whom, and the American lady, Lady B
sat down to whist. The Frenchmen smoked of course
(they were really modest gentlemen, and seemed dismayed),
and Lady B played for the next hour or two
with a cigar continually in her mouth&mdash;never out of
it. She certainly smoked six or eight. Lady A gave
in soon&mdash;I think she only did it out of vanity. American
lady had been smoking all the morning. I took
no more; and Lady B and the Frenchmen had it all
to themselves.</p>

<p>"Conceive this in a great hotel, with not only their
own servants, but half a dozen waiters coming constantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_293" id="Page_2_293">[293]</a></span>
in and out! I showed no atom of surprise;
but I never <i>was</i> so surprised, so ridiculously taken
aback, in my life; for in all my experience of 'ladies'
of one kind and another, I never saw a woman&mdash;not a
basket woman or a gypsy&mdash;smoke, before!" He lived
to have larger and wider experience, but there was
enough to startle as well as amuse him in the scene
described.</p>

<p>But now Saturday is come; he has hurried back for
the friends who are on their way to his cottage; and on
his arrival, even before they have appeared, he writes
to tell me his better news of himself and his work.</p>

<p>"In the breathless interval" (Rosemont: 3rd of
October) "between our return from Geneva and the
arrival of the Talfourds (expected in an hour or two),
I cannot do better than write to you. For I think you
will be well pleased if I anticipate my promise, and
Monday, at the same time. I have been greatly better
at Geneva, though I still am made uneasy by occasional
giddiness and headache: attributable, I have not the
least doubt, to the absence of streets. There is an idea
here, too, that people are occasionally made despondent
and sluggish in their spirits by this great mass of still
water, lake Leman. At any rate I have been very uncomfortable:
at any rate I am, I hope, greatly better:
and (lastly) at any rate I hope and trust, <i>now</i>, the
Christmas book will come in due course!! I have had
three very good days' work at Geneva, and trust I may
finish the second part (the third is the shortest) by this
day week. Whenever I finish it, I will send you the
first two together. I do not think they can begin to
illustrate it, until the third arrives; for it is a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_294" id="Page_2_294">[294]</a></span>single minded
story, as it were, and an artist should know
the end: which I don't think very likely, unless he
reads it." Then, after relating a superhuman effort he
was making to lodge his visitors in his doll's house ("I
didn't like the idea of turning them out at night. It
is so dark in these lanes, and groves, when the moon's
not bright"), he sketched for me what he possibly
might, and really did, accomplish. He would by great
effort finish the small book on the 20th; would fly to
Geneva for a week to work a little at <i>Dombey</i>, if he
felt "pretty sound;" in any case would finish his number
three by the 10th of November; and on that day
would start for Paris: "so that, instead of resting unprofitably
here, I shall be using my interval of idleness
to make the journey and get into a new house, and shall
hope so to put a pinch of salt on the tail of the sliding
number in advance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am horrified at the idea
of getting the blues (and bloodshots) again." Though
I did not then know how gravely ill he had been, I was
fain to remind him that it was bad economy to make
business out of rest itself; but I received prompt confirmation
that all was falling out as he wished. The
Talfourds stayed two days: "and I think they were
very happy. He was in his best aspect; the manner so
well known to us, not the less loveable for being laughable;
and if you could have seen him going round and
round the coach that brought them, as a preliminary to
paying the voiturier to whom he couldn't speak, in a
currency he didn't understand, you never would have
forgotten it." His friends left Lausanne on the 5th;
and five days later he sent me two-thirds of the manuscript
of his Christmas book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"I send</span> you in twelve letters, counting this as one,
the first two parts (thirty-five slips) of the Christmas
book. I have two present anxieties respecting it. One
to know that you have received it safely; and the
second to know how it strikes you. Be sure you read
the first and second parts together.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There seems
to me to be interest in it, and a pretty idea; and it is
unlike the others.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There will be some minor points
for consideration: as, the necessity for some slight
alterations in one or two of the Doctor's speeches in
the first part; and whether it should be called 'The
Battle of Life. A Love Story'&mdash;to express both a love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_296" id="Page_2_296">[296]</a></span>
story in the common acceptation of the phrase, and
also a story of love; with one or two other things of
that sort. We can moot these by and by. I made a
tremendous day's work of it yesterday and was horribly
excited&mdash;so I am going to rush out, as fast as I can:
being a little used up, and sick.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But never say die!
I have been to the glass to look at my eye. Pretty
bright!"</p>

<p>I made it brighter next day by telling him that the
first number of <i>Dombey</i> had outstripped in sale the first
of <i>Chuzzlewit</i> by more than twelve thousand copies;
and his next letter, sending the close of his little tale,
showed his need of the comfort my pleasant news had
given him. "I really do not know what this story is
worth. I am so floored: wanting sleep, and never
having had my head free from it for this month past.
I think there are some places in this last part which I
may bring better together in the proof, and where a
touch or two may be of service; particularly in the
scene between Craggs and Michael Warden, where, as
it stands, the interest seems anticipated. But I shall
have the benefit of your suggestions, and my own then
cooler head, I hope; and I will be very careful with
the proofs, and keep them by me as long as I can.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Mr. Britain must have another Christian name, then?
'Aunt Martha' is the Sally of whom the Doctor
speaks in the first part. Martha is a better name.
What do you think of the concluding paragraph?
Would you leave it for happiness' sake? It is merely
experimental.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am flying to Geneva to-morrow
morning." (That was on the 18th of October; and
on the 20th he wrote from Geneva.) "We came here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_297" id="Page_2_297">[297]</a></span>
yesterday, and we shall probably remain until Katey's
birthday, which is next Thursday week. I shall fall to
work on number three of <i>Dombey</i> as soon as I can. At
present I am the worse for wear, but nothing like as
much so as I expected to be on Sunday last. I had not
been able to sleep for some time, and had been hammering
away, morning, noon, and night. A bottle of
hock on Monday, when Elliotson dined with us (he
went away homeward yesterday morning), did me a
world of good; the change comes in the very nick of
time; and I feel in Dombeian spirits already.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But
I have still rather a damaged head, aching a good deal
occasionally, as it is doing now, though I have not been
cupped&mdash;yet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I dreamed all last week that the <i>Battle
of Life</i> was a series of chambers impossible to be got
to rights or got out of, through which I wandered
drearily all night. On Saturday night I don't think I
slept an hour. I was perpetually roaming through the
story, and endeavouring to dove-tail the revolution
here into the plot. The mental distress, quite horrible."</p>

<p>Of the "revolution" he had written to me a week
before, from Lausanne; where the news had just reached
them, that, upon the Federal Diet decreeing the expulsion
of the Jesuits, the Roman Catholic cantons had
risen against the decree, the result being that the
Protestants had deposed the grand council and established
a provisional government, dissolving the Catholic
league. His interest in this, and prompt seizure
of what really was brought into issue by the conflict,
is every way characteristic of Dickens. "You will
know," he wrote from Lausanne on the 11th of October,
"long before you get this, all about the revolution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_298" id="Page_2_298">[298]</a></span>
at Geneva. There were stories of plots against the
Government when I was there, but I didn't believe
them; for all sorts of lies are always afloat against the
radicals, and wherever there is a consul from a Catholic
Power the most monstrous fictions are in perpetual circulation
against them: as in this very place, where the
Sardinian consul was gravely whispering the other day
that a society called the Homicides had been formed,
whereof the president of the council of state, the
O'Connell of Switzerland and a clever fellow, was a
member; who were sworn on skulls and cross-bones to
exterminate men of property, and so forth. There was
a great stir here, on the day of the fight in Geneva.
We heard the guns (they shook this house) all day;
and seven hundred men marched out of this town of
Lausanne to go and help the radical party&mdash;arriving at
Geneva just after it was all over. There is no doubt
they had received secret help from here; for a powder
barrel, found by some of the Genevese populace with
'Canton de Vaud' painted on it, was carried on a pole
about the streets as a standard, to show that they were
sympathized with by friends outside. It was a poor
mean fight enough, I am told by Lord Vernon, who
was present and who was with us last night. The Government
was afraid; having no confidence whatever, I
dare say, in its own soldiers; and the cannon were
fired everywhere except at the opposite party, who (I
mean the revolutionists) had barricaded a bridge with
an omnibus only, and certainly in the beginning might
have been turned with ease. The precision of the
common men with the rifle was especially shown by a
small party of <i>five</i>, who waited on the ramparts near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_299" id="Page_2_299">[299]</a></span>
one of the gates of the town, to turn a body of soldiery
who were coming in to the Government assistance.
They picked out every officer and struck him down instantly,
the moment the party appeared; there were
three or four of them; upon which the soldiers gravely
turned round and walked off. I dare say there are not
fifty men in this place who wouldn't click your card off
a target a hundred and fifty yards away, at least. I
have seen them, time after time, fire across a great
ravine as wide as the ornamental ground in St. James's-park,
and never miss the bull's-eye.</p>

<p>"It is a horribly ungentlemanly thing to say here,
though I <i>do</i> say it without the least reserve&mdash;but my
sympathy is all with the radicals. I don't know any
subject on which this indomitable people have so good
a right to a strong feeling as Catholicity&mdash;if not as a
religion, clearly as a means of social degradation. They
know what it is. They live close to it. They have
Italy beyond their mountains. They can compare the
effect of the two systems at any time in their own
valleys; and their dread of it, and their horror of the
introduction of Catholic priests and emissaries into
their towns, seems to me the most rational feeling in
the world. Apart from this, you have no conception
of the preposterous, insolent little aristocracy of Geneva:
the most ridiculous caricature the fancy can suggest of
what we know in England. I was talking to two famous
gentlemen (very intelligent men) of that place, not long
ago, who came over to invite me to a sort of reception
there&mdash;which I declined. Really their talk about 'the
people' and 'the masses,' and the necessity they would
shortly be under of shooting a few of them as an example<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_300" id="Page_2_300">[300]</a></span>
for the rest, was a kind of monstrosity one might
have heard at Genoa. The audacious insolence and
contempt of the people by their newspapers, too, is
quite absurd. It is difficult to believe that men of
sense can be such donkeys politically. It was precisely
such a state of things that brought about the change
here. There was a most respectful petition presented
on the Jesuit question, signed by its tens of thousands
of small farmers; the regular peasants of the canton,
all splendidly taught in public schools, and intellectually
as well as physically a most remarkable body of
labouring men. This document is treated by the
gentlemanly party with the most sublime contempt,
and the signatures are said to be the signatures of 'the
rabble.' Upon which, each man of the rabble shoulders
his rifle, and walks in upon a given day agreed
upon among them to Lausanne; and the gentlemanly
party walk out without striking a blow."</p>

<p>Such traces of the "revolution" as he found upon
his present visit to Geneva he described in writing to
me from the hotel de l'Ecu on the 20th of October.
"You never would suppose from the look of this town
that there had been anything revolutionary going on.
Over the window of my old bedroom there is a great
hole made by a cannon-ball in the house-front; and
two of the bridges are under repair. But these are
small tokens which anything else might have brought
about as well. The people are all at work. The little
streets are rife with every sight and sound of industry;
the place is as quiet by ten o'clock as Lincoln's-inn-fields;
and the only outward and visible sign of public
interest in political events is a little group at every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_301" id="Page_2_301">[301]</a></span>
street corner, reading a public announcement from the
new Government of the forthcoming election of state-officers,
in which the people are reminded of their
importance as a republican institution, and desired to
bear in mind their dignity in all their proceedings.
Nothing very violent or bad could go on with a community
so well educated as this. It is the best antidote
to American experiences, conceivable. As to
the nonsense 'the gentlemanly interest' talk about,
their opposition to property and so forth, there never
was such mortal absurdity. One of the principal leaders
in the late movement has a stock of watches and
jewellery here of immense value&mdash;and had, during the
disturbance&mdash;perfectly unprotected. James Fahzey has
a rich house and a valuable collection of pictures; and,
I will be bound to say, twice as much to lose as half
the conservative declaimers put together. This house,
the liberal one, is one of the most richly furnished
and luxurious hotels on the continent. And if I were
a Swiss with a hundred thousand pounds, I would be
as steady against the Catholic cantons and the propagation
of Jesuitism as any radical among 'em: believing
the dissemination of Catholicity to be the most horrible
means of political and social degradation left in the
world. Which these people, thoroughly well educated,
know perfectly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The boys of Geneva were very
useful in bringing materials for the construction of the
barricades on the bridges; and the enclosed song may
amuse you. They sing it to a tune that dates from the
great French Revolution&mdash;a very good one."</p>

<p>But revolutions may be small as well as their heroes,
and while he thus was sending me his Gamin de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_302" id="Page_2_302">[302]</a></span>
Gen&egrave;ve I was sending him news of a sudden change in
Whitefriars which had quite as vivid interest for him.
Not much could be told him at first, but his curiosity
instantly arose to fever pitch. "In reference to that
<i>Daily News</i> revolution," he wrote from Geneva on the
26th, "I have been walking and wondering all day
through a perfect Miss Burney's Vauxhall of conjectural
dark walks. Heaven send you enlighten me
fully on Wednesday, or number three will suffer!"
Two days later he resumed, as he was beginning his
journey back to Lausanne. "I am in a great state of
excitement on account of your intelligence, and desperately
anxious to know all about it. I shall be put out
to an unspeakable extent if I don't find your letter
awaiting me. God knows there has been small comfort
for either of us in the <i>D. N.</i>'s nine months."
There was not much to tell then, and there is less now;
but at last the discomfort was over for us both, as I had
been unable to reconcile myself to a longer continuance
of the service I had given in Whitefriars since he
quitted it. The subject may be left with the remark
made upon it in his first letter after returning to Rosemont.
"I certainly am very glad of the result of the
<i>Daily News</i> business, though my gladness is dashed
with melancholy to think that you should have toiled
there so long, to so little purpose. I escaped more
easily. However, it is all past now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As to the
undoubted necessity of the course you took, I have not
a grain of question in my mind. That, being what you
are, you had only one course to take and have taken it,
I no more doubt than that the Old Bailey is not Westminster
Abbey. In the utmost sum at which you value<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_303" id="Page_2_303">[303]</a></span>
yourself, you were bound to leave; and now you <i>have</i>
left, you will come to Paris, and there, and at home
again, we'll have, please God, the old kind of evenings
and the old life again, as it used to be before those
daily nooses caught us by the legs and sometimes
tripped us up. Make a vow (as I have done) never to
go down that court with the little news-shop at the corner,
any more, and let us swear by Jack Straw as in the
ancient times.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am beginning to get over my
sorrow for your nights up aloft in Whitefriars, and to
feel nothing but happiness in the contemplation of
your enfranchisement. God bless you!"</p>

<p>The time was now shortening for him at Lausanne;
but before my sketches of his pleasant days there close,
the little story of his Christmas book may be made
complete by a few extracts from the letters that followed
immediately upon the departure of the Talfourds.
Without comment they will explain its closing touches,
his own consciousness of the difficulties in working out
the tale within limits too confined not to render its
proper development imperfect, and his ready tact in
dealing with objection and suggestion from without.
His condition while writing it did not warrant me in
pressing what I might otherwise have thought necessary;
but as the little story finally left his hands, it
had points not unworthy of him; and a sketch of its
design will render the fragments from his letters more
intelligible. I read it lately with a sense that its general
tone of quiet beauty deserved well the praise which
Jeffrey in those days had given it. "I like and admire
the <i>Battle</i> extremely," he said in a letter on its publication,
sent me by Dickens and not included in Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_304" id="Page_2_304">[304]</a></span>
Cockburn's Memoir. "It is better than any other man
alive could have written, and has passages as fine as
anything that ever came from the man himself. The
dance of the sisters in that autumn orchard is of itself
worth a dozen inferior tales, and their reunion at the
close, and indeed all the serious parts, are beautiful,
some traits of Clemency charming."</p>

<p>Yet it was probably here the fact, as with the <i>Chimes</i>,
that the serious parts were too much interwoven with
the tale to render the subject altogether suitable to the
old mirth-bringing season; but this had also some
advantages. The story is all about two sisters, the
younger of whom, Marion, sacrifices her own affection
to give happiness to the elder, Grace. But Grace had
already made the same sacrifice for this younger sister;
life's first and hardest battle had been won by her
before the incidents begin; and when she is first seen,
she is busying herself to bring about her sister's
marriage with Alfred Heathfield, whom she has herself
loved, and whom she has kept wholly unconscious, by
a quiet change in her bearing to him, of what his own
still disengaged heart would certainly not have rejected.
Marion, however, had earlier discovered this, though
it is not until her victory over herself that Alfred knows
it; and meanwhile he is become her betrothed. The
sisters thus shown at the opening, one believing her
love undiscovered and the other bent for the sake of
that love on surrendering her own, each practising concealment
and both unselfishly true, form a pretty and
tender picture. The second part is intended to give to
Marion's flight the character of an elopement; and so
to manage this as to show her all the time unchanged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_305" id="Page_2_305">[305]</a></span>
to the man she is pledged to, yet flying from, was the
author's difficulty. One Michael Warden is the <i>deus
ex machin&acirc;</i> by whom it is solved, hardly with the usual
skill; but there is much art in rendering his pretensions
to the hand of Marion, whose husband he becomes
after an interval of years, the means of closing against
him all hope of success, in the very hour when her own
act might seem to be opening it to him. During the
same interval Grace, believing Marion to be gone with
Warden, becomes Alfred's wife; and not until reunion
after six years' absence is the truth entirely known to
her. The struggle, to all of them, has been filled and
chastened with sorrow; but joy revisits them at its
close. Hearts are not broken by the duties laid upon
them; nor is life shown to be such a perishable holiday,
that amidst noble sorrow and generous self-denial
it must lose its capacity for happiness. The tale thus
justifies its place in the Christmas series. What Jeffrey
says of Clemency, too, may suggest another word. The
story would not be Dickens's if we could not discover
in it the power peculiar to him of presenting the commonest
objects with freshness and beauty, of detecting
in the homeliest forms of life much of its rarest loveliness,
and of springing easily upward from everyday
realities into regions of imaginative thought. To this
happiest direction of his art, Clemency and her husband
render new tribute; and in her more especially,
once again, we recognize one of those true souls who
fill so large a space in his writings, for whom the lowest
seats at life's feasts are commonly kept, but whom he
moves and welcomes to a more fitting place among the
prized and honoured at the upper tables.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_306" id="Page_2_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder whether you foresaw the end of the
Christmas book! There are two or three places in
which I can make it prettier, I think, by slight alterations.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I trust to Heaven you may like it. What
an affecting story I could have made of it in one octavo
volume. Oh to think of the printers transforming my
kindly cynical old father into Doctor Taddler!" (28th
of October.)</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Do you think it worth while, in the illustrations, to
throw the period back at all for the sake of anything
good in the costume? The story may have happened
at any time within a hundred years. Is it worth
having coats and gowns of dear old Goldsmith's day?
or thereabouts? I really don't know what to say.
The probability is, if it has not occurred to you or to
the artists, that it is hardly worth considering; but I
ease myself of it by throwing it out to you. It may
be already too late, or you may see reason to think it
best to 'stick to the <i>last</i>' (I feel it necessary to italicize
the joke), and abide by the ladies' and gentlemen's
spring and winter fashions of this time. Whatever you
think best, in this as in all other things, is best, I am
sure.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I would go, in the illustrations, for 'beauty'
as much as possible; and I should like each part to
have a general illustration to it at the beginning, shadowing
out its drift and bearing: much as Browne goes
at that kind of thing on <i>Dombey</i> covers. I don't think
I should fetter your discretion in the matter farther.
The better it is illustrated, the better I shall be pleased
of course." (29th of October.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_307" id="Page_2_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>"&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I only write to say that it is of no use my
writing at length, until I have heard from you; and
that I will wait until I shall have read your promised
communication (as my father would call it) to-morrow.
I have glanced over the proofs of the last part and
really don't wonder, some of the most extravagant
mistakes occurring in Clemency's account to Warden,
that the marriage of Grace and Alfred should seem
rather unsatisfactory to you. Whatever is done about
that must be done with the lightest hand, for the reader
<span class="smcap">must</span> take something for granted; but I think it next
to impossible, without dreadful injury to the effect, to
introduce a scene between Marion and Michael. The
introduction must be in the scene between the sisters,
and must be put, mainly, into the mouth of Grace.
Rely upon it there is no other way, in keeping with
the spirit of the tale. With this amendment, and a
touch here and there in the last part (I know exactly
where they will come best), I think it may be pretty
and affecting, and comfortable too.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." (31st of
October.)</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I shall hope to touch upon the Christmas
book as soon as I get your opinion. I wouldn't do it
without. I am delighted to hear of noble old Stanny.
Give my love to him, and tell him I think of turning
Catholic. It strikes me (it may have struck you perhaps)
that another good place for introducing a few
lines of dialogue, is at the beginning of the scene between
Grace and her husband, where he speaks about
the messenger at the gate." (4th of November.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_308" id="Page_2_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Before I reply to your questions I wish to remark
generally of the third part that all the passion that can
be got into it, through my interpretation at all events,
is there. I know that, by what it cost me; and I take
it to be, as a question of art and interest, in the very
nature of the story that it <i>should</i> move at a swift pace
after the sisters are in each other's arms again. Anything
after that would drag like lead, and must.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Now for your questions. I don't think any little scene
with Marion and anybody can prepare the way for the
last paragraph of the tale: I don't think anything but
a printer's line <i>can</i> go between it and Warden's speech.
A less period than ten years? Yes. I see no objection
to six. I have no doubt you are right. Any word from
Alfred in his misery? Impossible: you might as well
try to speak to somebody in an express train. The preparation
for his change is in the first part, and he kneels
down beside her in that return scene. He is left alone
with her, as it were, in the world. I am quite confident
it is wholly impossible for me to alter that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
BUT (keep your eye on me) when Marion went away,
she left a letter for Grace in which she charged her to
encourage the love that Alfred would conceive for her,
and <span class="smcap">forewarned</span> her that years would pass before they
met again, &amp;c. &amp;c. This coming out in the scene
between the sisters, and something like it being expressed
in the opening of the little scene between Grace
and her husband before the messenger at the gate, will
make (I hope) a prodigious difference; and I will try
to put in something with Aunt Martha and the Doctor
which shall carry the tale back more distinctly and
unmistakeably to the battle-ground. I hope to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_309" id="Page_2_309">[309]</a></span>
these alterations next week, and to send the third part
back to you before I leave here. If you think it can
still be improved after that, say so to me in Paris and
I will go at it again. I wouldn't have it limp, if it
can fly. I say nothing to you of a great deal of this
being already expressed in the sentiment of the beginning,
because your delicate perception knows all that
already. Observe for the artists. Grace will now only
have <i>one child</i>&mdash;little Marion."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (At night, on same
day.)&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "You recollect that I asked you to read it
all together, for I knew that I was working for that?
But I have no doubt of <i>your</i> doubts, and will do what
I have said.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I had thought of marking the time
in the little story, and will do so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Think, once
more, of the period between the second and third parts.
I will do the same." (7th of November.)</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"I hope you will think the third part (when you read
it in type with these amendments) very much improved.
I think it so. If there should still be anything wanting,
in your opinion, pray suggest it to me in Paris. I
am bent on having it right, if I can.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If in going
over the proofs you find the tendency to blank verse (I
<i>cannot</i> help it, when I am very much in earnest) too
strong, knock out a word's brains here and there."
(13th of November. Sending the proofs back.)</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Your Christmas book illustration-news makes
me jump for joy. I will write you at length to-morrow.
I should like this dedication: This Christmas Book is
cordially inscribed To my English Friends in Switzerland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_310" id="Page_2_310">[310]</a></span>
Just those two lines, and nothing more. When
I get the proofs again I think I may manage another
word or two about the battle-field, with advantage. I
am glad you like the alterations. I feel that they make
it complete, and that it would have been incomplete
without your suggestions." (21st of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Nove ber'">November</ins>. From
Paris.)</p>

<p>I had managed, as a glad surprise for him, to enlist
both Stanfield and Maclise in the illustration of the
story, in addition to the distinguished artists whom
the publishers had engaged for it, Leech and Richard
Doyle; and among the subjects contributed by Stanfield
are three morsels of English landscape which had
a singular charm for Dickens at the time, and seem to
me still of their kind quite faultless. I may add a
curious fact, never mentioned until now. In the illustration
which closes the second part of the story, where
the festivities to welcome the bridegroom at the top
of the page contrast with the flight of the bride represented
below, Leech made the mistake of supposing
that Michael Warden had taken part in the elopement,
and has introduced his figure with that of Marion.
We did not discover this until too late for remedy, the
publication having then been delayed, for these drawings,
to the utmost limit; and it is highly characteristic
of Dickens, and of the true regard he had for this fine
artist, that, knowing the pain he must give in such
circumstances by objection or complaint, he preferred
to pass it silently. Nobody made remark upon it, and
there the illustration still stands; but any one who
reads the tale carefully will at once perceive what
havoc it makes of one of the most delicate turns in it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_311" id="Page_2_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>"When I first saw it, it was with a horror and agony
not to be expressed. Of course I need not tell <i>you</i>,
my dear fellow, Warden has no business in the elopement
scene. <i>He</i> was never there! In the first hot
sweat of this surprise and novelty, I was going to implore
the printing of that sheet to be stopped, and the
figure taken out of the block. But when I thought of
the pain this might give to our kind-hearted Leech;
and that what is such a monstrous enormity to me, as
never having entered my brain, may not so present
itself to others, I became more composed: though the
fact is wonderful to me. No doubt a great number
of copies will be printed by the time this reaches you,
and therefore I shall take it for granted that it stands
as it is. Leech otherwise is very good, and the illustrations
altogether are by far the best that have been
done for any of the Christmas books. You know how
I build up temples in my mind that are not made with
hands (or expressed with pen and ink, I am afraid),
and how liable I am to be disappointed in these things.
But I really am <i>not</i> disappointed in this case. Quietness
and beauty are preserved throughout. Say everything
to Mac and Stanny, more than everything! It
is a delight to look at these little landscapes of the dear
old boy. How gentle and elegant, and yet how manly
and vigorous, they are! I have a perfect joy in <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hem'">them</ins>."</p>

<p>Of the few days that remained of his Lausanne life,
before he journeyed to Paris, there is not much requiring
to be said. His work had continued during the
whole of the month before departure to occupy him
so entirely as to leave room for little else, and even
occasional letters to very dear friends at home were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_312" id="Page_2_312">[312]</a></span>
intermitted. Here is one example of many. "I will
write to Landor as soon as I can possibly make time,
but I really am so much at my desk perforce, and so
full of work, whether I am there or elsewhere, between
the Christmas book and <i>Dombey</i>, that it is the most
difficult thing in the world for me to make up my mind
to write a letter to any one but you. I ought to have
written to Macready. I wish you would tell him, with
my love, how I am situated in respect of pen, ink, and
paper. One of the Lausanne papers, treating of free
trade, has been very copious lately in its mention of
<span class="smcap">Lord Gobden</span>. Fact; and I think it a good name."
Then, as the inevitable time approached, he cast about
him for such comfort as the coming change might
bring, to set against the sorrow of it; and began to
think of Paris, "'in a less romantic and more homely
contemplation of the picture,'" as not wholly undesirable.
I have no doubt that constant change, too, is indispensable
to me when I am at work: and at times
something more than a doubt will force itself upon me
whether there is not something in a Swiss valley that
disagrees with me. Certainly, whenever I live in
Switzerland again, it shall be on the hill-top. Something
of the <i>go&icirc;tre</i> and <i>cretin</i> influence seems to settle
on my spirits sometimes, on the lower ground.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_313" id="Page_2_313">[313]</a></span>
sorry, ah yes! how sorry I shall be to leave the little
society nevertheless. We have been thoroughly good-humoured
and agreeable together, and I'll always give
a hurrah for the Swiss and Switzerland."</p>

<p>One or two English travelling by Lausanne had
meanwhile greeted him as they were passing home, and
a few days given him by Elliotson had been an enjoyment
without a drawback. It was now the later
autumn, very high winds were coursing through the
valley, and his last letter but one described the change
which these approaches of winter were making in the
scene. "We have had some tremendous hurricanes at
Lausanne. It is an extraordinary place now for wind,
being peculiarly situated among mountains&mdash;between
the Jura, and the Simplon, St. Gothard, St. Bernard, and
Mont Blanc ranges; and at night you would swear
(lying in bed) you were at sea. You cannot imagine
wind blowing so, over earth. It is very fine to hear.
The weather generally, however, has been excellent.
There is snow on the tops of nearly all the hills, but
none has fallen in the valley. On a bright day, it is
quite hot between eleven and half past two. The
nights and mornings are cold. For the last two or
three days, it has been thick weather; and I can see
no more of Mont Blanc from where I am writing now
than if I were in Devonshire terrace, though last week
it bounded all the Lausanne walks. I would give a
great deal that you could take a walk with me about
Lausanne on a clear cold day. It is impossible to
imagine anything more noble and beautiful than the
scene; and the autumn colours in the foliage are more
brilliant and vivid now than any description could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_314" id="Page_2_314">[314]</a></span>
convey to you. I took Elliotson, when he was with us,
up to a ravine I had found out in the hills eight hundred
or a thousand feet deep! Its steep sides dyed
bright yellow, and deep red, by the changing leaves; a
sounding torrent rolling down below; the lake of
Geneva lying at its foot; one enormous mass and chaos
of trees at its upper end; and mountain piled on
mountain in the distance, up into the sky! He really
was struck silent by its majesty and splendour."</p>

<p>He had begun his third number of <i>Dombey</i> on the
26th of October, on the 4th of the following month he
was half through it, on the 7th he was in the "agonies"
of its last chapter, and on the 9th, one day before that
proposed for its completion, all was done. This was
marvellously rapid work, after what else he had undergone;
but within a week, Monday the 16th being the
day for departure, they were to strike their tents, and
troubled and sad were the few days thus left him for
preparation and farewell. He included in his leave-taking
his deaf, dumb, and blind friends; and, to use
his own homely phrase, was yet more terribly "down in
the mouth" at taking leave of his hearing, speaking,
and seeing friends. "I shall see you soon, please
God, and that sets all to rights. But I don't believe
there are many dots on the map of the world where we
shall have left such affectionate remembrances behind
us, as in Lausanne. It was quite miserable this last
night, when we left them at Haldimand's."</p>

<p>He shall himself describe how they travelled post to
Paris, occupying five days. "We got through the
journey charmingly, though not quite so quickly as we
hoped. The children as good as usual, and even Skittles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_315" id="Page_2_315">[315]</a></span>
jolly to the last. (That name has long superseded
Sampson Brass, by the bye. I call him so, from something
skittle-playing and public-housey in his countenance.)
We have been up at five every morning, and
on the road before seven. We were three carriages:
a sort of wagon, with a cabriolet attached, for the luggage;
a ramshackle villainous old swing upon wheels
(hired at Geneva), for the children; and for ourselves,
that travelling chariot which I was so kind as to bring
here for sale. It was very cold indeed crossing the
Jura&mdash;nothing but fog and frost; but when we were
out of Switzerland and across the French frontier, it
became warmer, and continued so. We stopped at between
six and seven each evening; had two rather
queer inns, wild French country inns; but the rest
good. They were three hours and a half examining
the luggage at the frontier custom-house&mdash;atop of a
mountain, in a hard and biting frost; where Anne and
Roche had sharp work I assure you, and the latter insisted
on volunteering the most astonishing and unnecessary
lies about my books, for the mere pleasure of
deceiving the officials. When we were out of the mountain
country, we came at a good pace, but were a day
late in getting to our hotel here."</p>

<p>They were in Paris when that was written; at the
hotel Brighton; which they had reached in the evening
of Friday the 20th of November.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> man enjoyed brief residence in a hotel more than
Dickens, but "several tons of luggage, other tons of
servants, and other tons of children" are not desirable
accompaniments to this kind of life; and his first day
in Paris did not close before he had offered for an
"eligible mansion." That same Saturday night he
took a "colossal" walk about the city, of which the
brilliancy and brightness almost frightened him; and
among other things that attracted his notice was "rather
a good book announced in a bookseller's window as
<i>Les Myst&egrave;res de Londres par Sir Trollopp</i>. Do you
know him?" A countryman better known had given
him earlier greeting. "The first man who took hold
of me in the street, immediately outside this door, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_317" id="Page_2_317">[317]</a></span>
Bruffum in his check trousers, and without the proper
number of buttons on his shirt, who was going away
this morning, he told me, but coming back in two
months, when we would go and dine&mdash;at some place
known to him and fame."</p>

<p>Next day he took another long walk about the streets,
and lost himself fifty times. This was Sunday, and he
hardly knew what to say of it, as he saw it there and
then. The bitter observance of that day he always
sharply resisted, believing a little rational enjoyment to
be not opposed to either rest or religion; but here was
another matter. "The dirty churches, and the clattering
carts and waggons, and the open shops (I don't
think I passed fifty shut up, in all my strollings in and
out), and the work-a-day dresses and drudgeries, are
not comfortable. Open theatres and so forth I am
well used to, of course, by this time; but so much toil
and sweat on what one would like to see, apart from
religious observances, a sensible holiday, is painful."</p>

<p>The date of his letter was the 22nd of November,
and it had three postscripts.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The first, "Monday
afternoon," told me a house was taken; that, unless
the agreement should break off on any unforeseen fight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_318" id="Page_2_318">[318]</a></span>
between Roche and the agent ("a French Mrs. Gamp"),
I was to address him at No. 48, Rue de Courcelles, Faubourg
St. Honor&eacute;; and that he would merely then
advert to the premises as in his belief the "most ridiculous,
extraordinary, unparalleled, and preposterous"
in the whole world; being something between a baby-house,
a "shades," a haunted castle, and a mad kind
of clock. "They belong to a Marquis Castellan, and
you will be ready to die of laughing when you go over
them." The second P.S. declared that his lips should
be sealed till I beheld for myself. "By Heaven it is
not to be imagined by the mind of man!" The third
P.S. closed the letter. "One room is a tent. Another
room is a grove. Another room is a scene at
the Victoria. The upstairs rooms are like fanlights
over street-doors. The nurseries&mdash;but no, no, no, no
more!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>His following letter nevertheless sent more, even in
the form of an additional protestation that never till I
saw it should the place be described. "I will merely
observe that it is fifty yards long, and eighteen feet
high, and that the bedrooms are exactly like opera-boxes.
It has its little courtyard and garden, and
porter's house, and cordon to open the door, and so
forth; and is a Paris mansion in little. There is a
gleam of reason in the drawing-room. Being a gentleman's
house, and not one furnished to let, it has
some very curious things in it; some of the oddest
things you ever beheld in your life; and an infinity of
easy chairs and sofas.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bad weather. It is snowing
hard. There is not a door or window here&mdash;but
that's nothing! there's not a door or window in all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_319" id="Page_2_319">[319]</a></span>
Paris&mdash;that shuts; not a chink in all the billions of
trillions of chinks in the city that can he stopped to
keep the wind out. And the cold!&mdash;but you shall
judge for yourself; and also of this preposterous dining-room.
The invention, sir, of Henry Bulwer, who when
he had executed it (he used to live here), got frightened
at what he had done, as well he might, and went away.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The Brave called me aside on Saturday night, and
showed me an improvement he had effected in the
decorative way. 'Which,' he said, 'will very much
s'prize Mis'r Fors'er when he come.' You are to be
deluded into the belief that there is a perspective of
chambers twenty miles in length, opening from the
drawing-room.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>My visit was not yet due, however, and what occupied
or interested him in the interval may first be told.
He had not been two days in Paris when a letter from
his father made him very anxious for the health of his
eldest sister. "I was going to the play (a melodrama
in eight acts, five hours long), but hadn't the heart to
leave home after my father's letter," he is writing on
the 30th of November, "and sent Georgy and Kate by
themselves. There seems to be no doubt whatever that
Fanny is in a consumption." She had broken down
in an attempt to sing at a party in Manchester; and
subsequent examination by Sir Charles Bell's son, who
was present and took much interest in her, too sadly
revealed the cause. "He advised that neither she nor
Burnett should be told the truth, and my father has not
disclosed it. In worldly circumstances they are very
comfortable, and they are very much respected. They
seem to be happy together, and Burnett has a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_320" id="Page_2_320">[320]</a></span>
deal of teaching. You remember my fears about her
when she was in London the time of Alfred's marriage,
and that I said she looked to me as if she were in a
decline? Kate took her to Elliotson, who said that
her lungs were certainly not affected then. And she
cried for joy. Don't you think it would be better for
her to be brought up, if possible, to see Elliotson again?
I am deeply, deeply grieved about it." This course
was taken, and for a time there seemed room for hope;
but the result will be seen. In the same letter I heard
of poor Charles Sheridan, well known to us both, dying
of the same terrible disease; and his chief, Lord Normanby,
whose many acts of sympathy and kindness had
inspired strong regard in Dickens, he had already found
"as informal and good-natured as ever, but not so gay
as usual, and having an anxious, haggard way with him,
as if his responsibilities were more than he had bargained
for." Nor, to account for this, had Dickens
far to seek, when a little leisure enabled him to see
something of what was passing in Paris in that last year
of Louis Philippe's reign. What first impressed him
most unfavourably was a glimpse in the Champs Elys&eacute;es,
of the King himself coming in from the country.
"There were two carriages. His was surrounded by
horseguards. It went at a great pace, and he sat very
far back in a corner of it, I promise you. It was strange
to an Englishman to see the Prefet of Police riding on
horseback some hundreds of yards in advance of the
cort&eacute;ge, turning his head incessantly from side to side,
like a figure in a Dutch clock, and scrutinizing everybody
and everything, as if he suspected all the twigs
in all the trees in the long avenue."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_321" id="Page_2_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>But these and other political indications were only,
as they generally prove to be, the outward signs of
maladies more deeply-seated. He saw almost everywhere
signs of canker eating into the heart of the people
themselves. "It is a wicked and detestable place,
though wonderfully attractive; and there can be no
better summary of it, after all, than Hogarth's unmentionable
phrase." He sent me no letter that did not
contribute something of observation or character. He
went at first rather frequently to the Morgue, until
shocked by something so repulsive that he had not
courage for a long time to go back; and on that same
occasion he had noticed the keeper smoking a short
pipe at his little window, "and giving a bit of fresh
turf to a linnet in a cage." Of the condition generally
of the streets he reported badly; the quays on the other
side of the Seine were not safe after dark; and here was
his own night experience of one of the best quarters of
the city. "I took Georgy out, the night before last,
to show her the Palais Royal lighted up; and on the
Boulevard, a street as bright as the brightest part of the
Strand or Regent-street, we saw a man fall upon another,
close before us, and try to tear the cloak off his back.
It was in a little dark corner near the Porte St. Denis,
which stands out in the middle of the street. After a
short struggle, the thief fled (there were thousands of
people walking about), and was captured just on the
other side of the road."</p>

<p>An incident of that kind might mean little or much:
but what he proceeded to remark of the ordinary Parisian
workpeople and smaller shopkeepers, had a more grave
complexion; and may be thought perhaps still to yield<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_322" id="Page_2_322">[322]</a></span>
some illustration, not without value, to the story of the
quarter of a century that has passed since, and even to
some of the appalling events of its latest year or two.
"It is extraordinary what nonsense English people talk,
write, and believe, about foreign countries. The Swiss
(so much decried) will do anything for you, if you are
frank and civil; they are attentive and punctual in all
their dealings; and may be relied upon as steadily as
the English. The Parisian workpeople and smaller
shopkeepers are more like (and unlike) Americans than
I could have supposed possible. To the American indifference
and carelessness, they add a procrastination
and want of the least heed about keeping a promise or
being exact, which is certainly not surpassed in Naples.
They have the American semi-sentimental independence
too, and none of the American vigour or purpose. If
they ever get free trade in France (as I suppose they
will, one day), these parts of the population must, for
years and years, be ruined. They couldn't get the
means of existence, in competition with the English
workmen. Their inferior manual dexterity, their lazy
habits, perfect unreliability, and habitual insubordination,
would ruin them in any such contest, instantly.
They are fit for nothing but soldiering&mdash;and so far, I
believe, the successors in the policy of your friend Napoleon
have reason on their side. Eh bien, mon ami,
quand vous venez &agrave; Paris, nous nous mettrons &agrave; quatre
&eacute;pingles, et nous verrons toutes les merveilles de la cit&eacute;,
et vous en jugerez. God bless me, I beg your pardon!
It comes so natural."</p>

<p>On the 30th he wrote to me that he had got his
papers into order and hoped to begin that day. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_323" id="Page_2_323">[323]</a></span>
the same letter told me of the unsettlement thus early
of his half-formed Paris plans. Three months sooner
than he designed he should be due in London for
family reasons; should have to keep within the limit
of four months abroad; and as his own house would
not be free till July, would have to hire one from the
end of March. "In these circumstances I think I
shall send Charley to King's-college after Christmas.
I am sorry he should lose so much French, but don't
you think to break another half-year's schooling would
be a pity? Of my own will I would not send him to
King's-college at all, but to Bruce-castle instead. I
suppose, however, Miss Coutts is best. We will talk
over all this when I come to London." The offer to
take charge of his eldest son's education had been
pressed upon Dickens by this true friend, to whose delicate
and noble consideration for him it would hardly become
me to make other allusion here. Munificent as
the kindness was, however, it was yet only the smallest
part of the obligation which Dickens felt that he owed
this lady; to whose generous schemes for the neglected
and uncared-for classes of the population, in all which
he deeply sympathised, he did the very utmost to
render, through many years, unstinted service of his
time and his labour, with sacrifice unselfish as her own.
His proposed early visit to London, named in this letter,
was to see the rehearsal of his Christmas story, dramatised
by Mr. Albert Smith for Mr. and Mrs. Keeley at
the Lyceum; and my own proposed visit to Paris was
to be in the middle of January. "It will then be the
height of the season, and a good time for testing the
unaccountable French vanity which really does suppose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_324" id="Page_2_324">[324]</a></span>
there are no fogs here, but that they are all in
London."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>The opening of his next letter, which bore date the
6th of December, and its amusing sequel, will sufficiently
speak for themselves. "Cold intense. The
water in the bedroom-jugs freezes into solid masses
from top to bottom, bursts the jugs with reports like
small cannon, and rolls out on the tables and wash-stands,
hard as granite. I stick to the shower-bath,
but have been most hopelessly out of sorts&mdash;writing
sorts; that's all. Couldn't begin, in the strange place;
took a violent dislike to my study, and came down into
the drawing-room; couldn't find a corner that would
answer my purpose; fell into a black contemplation of
the waning month; sat six hours at a stretch, and
wrote as many lines, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then, you
know what arrangements are necessary with the chairs
and tables; and then what correspondence had to be
cleared off; and then how I tried to settle to my desk,
and went about and about it, and dodged at it, like a
bird at a lump of sugar. In short I have just begun;
five printed pages finished, I should say; and hope I
shall be blessed with a better condition this next week,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_325" id="Page_2_325">[325]</a></span>
or I shall be behind-hand. I shall try to go at it&mdash;hard.
I can't do more.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is rather a good
man lives in this street, and I have had a correspondence
with him which is preserved for your inspection.
His name is Barth&eacute;lemy. He wears a prodigious
Spanish cloak, a slouched hat, an immense beard, and
long black hair. He called the other day and left his
card. Allow me to enclose his card, which has originality
and merit.</p>

<div class='unindent'>Roche said I wasn't at home. Yesterday, he wrote me
to say that he too was a 'Litt&eacute;rateur'&mdash;that he had
called, in compliment to my distinguished reputation&mdash;'qu'il
n'avait pas &eacute;t&eacute; re&ccedil;u&mdash;qu'il n'&eacute;tait pas habitu&eacute; &agrave;
cette sorte de proc&eacute;d&eacute;&mdash;et qu'il pria Monsieur Dickens
d'oublier son nom, sa m&eacute;moire, sa carte, et sa visite,
et de consid&eacute;rer qu'elle n'avait pas &eacute;t&eacute; rendu!' Of
course I wrote him a very polite reply immediately,
telling him good-humouredly that he was quite mistaken,
and that there were always two weeks in the
beginning of every month when M. Dickens ne pouvait
rendre visite &agrave; personne. He wrote back to say that
he was more than satisfied; that it was his case too, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_326" id="Page_2_326">[326]</a></span>
the end of every month; and that when busy himself,
he not only can't receive or pay visits, but&mdash;'tombe,
g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement, aussi, dans des humeurs noires qui approchent
de l'anthropophagie!!!' I think that's pretty
well."</div>

<p>He was in London eight days, from the 15th to the
23rd of December;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and among the occupations of
his visit, besides launching his little story on the stage,
was the settlement of form for a cheap edition of his
writings, which began in the following year. It was
to be printed in double-columns, and issued weekly in
three-halfpenny numbers; there were to be new prefaces,
but no illustrations; and for each book something
less than a fourth of the original price was to be
charged. Its success was very good, but did not come
even near to the mark of the later issues of his writings.
His own feeling as to this, however, though any failure
at the moment affected him on other grounds, was always
that of a quiet confidence; and he had expressed
this in a proposed dedication of this very edition,
which for other reasons was ultimately laid aside. It
will be worth preserving here. "This cheap edition
of my books is dedicated to the English people, in
whose approval, if the books be true in spirit, they
will live, and out of whose memory, if they be false,
they will very soon die."</p>

<p>Upon his return to Paris I had frequent report of his
progress with his famous fifth number, on the completion
of which I was to join him. The day at one time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_327" id="Page_2_327">[327]</a></span>
seemed doubtful. "It would be miserable to have to
work while you were here. Still, I make such sudden
starts, and am so possessed of what I am going to do,
that the fear may prove to be quite groundless, and if
any alteration would trouble you, let the 13th stand at
all hazards." The cold he described as so intense,
and the price of fuel so enormous, that though the
house was not half warmed ("as you'll say, when you
feel it") it cost him very near a pound a day. Begging-letter
writers had found out "Monsieur Dickens, le
romancier c&eacute;l&egrave;bre," and waylaid him at the door and
in the street as numerously as in London: their distinguishing
peculiarity being that they were nearly all
of them "Chevaliers de la Garde Imp&eacute;riale de sa Majest&eacute;
Napol&eacute;on le Grand," and that their letters bore
immense seals with coats of arms as large as five-shilling
pieces. His friends the Watsons passed new year's day
with him on their way to Rockingham from Lausanne,
leaving that country covered with snow and the Bise
blowing cruelly over it, but describing it as nothing to
the cold of Paris. On the day that closed the old
year he had gone into the Morgue and seen an old man
with grey head lying there. "It seemed the strangest
thing in the world that it should have been necessary
to take any trouble to stop such a feeble, spent, exhausted
morsel of life. It was just dusk when I went
in; the place was empty; and he lay there, all alone,
like an impersonation of the wintry eighteen hundred
and forty-six.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I find I am getting inimitable, so
I'll stop."</p>

<p>The time for my visit having come, I had grateful
proof of the minute and thoughtful provision characteristic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_328" id="Page_2_328">[328]</a></span>
of him in everything. My dinner had been
ordered to the second at Boulogne, my place in the
malle-poste taken, and these and other services announced
in a letter, which, by way of doing its part
also in the kindly work of preparation, broke out into
French. He never spoke that language very well, his
accent being somehow defective; but he practised himself
into writing it with remarkable ease and fluency.
"I have written to the H&ocirc;tel des Bains at Boulogne to
send on to Calais and take your place in the malle-poste.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Of course you know that you'll be assailed with frightful
shouts all along the two lines of ropes from all the
touters in Boulogne, and of course you'll pass on like
the princess who went up the mountain after the talking
bird; but don't forget quietly to single out the
H&ocirc;tel des Bains commissionnaire. The following circumstances
will then occur. My experience is more
recent than yours, and I will throw them into a dramatic
form.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You are filtered into the little office, where
there are some soldiers; and a gentleman with a black
beard and a pen and ink sitting behind a counter.

s'&eacute;lancent sur lui, en poussant des cris &eacute;pouvantables.
Monsieur est, pour le moment, tout-&agrave;-fait effray&eacute; et
boulevers&eacute;. Mais monsieur reprend ses forces et dit,
de haute voix: 'Le Commissionnaire de l'H&ocirc;tel des

mangera son d&icirc;ner pr&egrave;s du feu, avec beaucoup de

arrivera au bureau de la poste aux lettres &agrave; deux

<p>We passed a fortnight together, and crowded into it
more than might seem possible to such a narrow space.
With a dreadful insatiability we passed through every
variety of sight-seeing, prisons, palaces, theatres, hospitals,
the Morgue and the Lazare, as well as the
Louvre, Versailles, St. Cloud, and all the spots made
memorable by the first revolution. The excellent
comedian Regnier, known to us through Macready and
endeared by many kindnesses, incomparable for his
knowledge of the city and unwearying in friendly service,
made us free of the green-room of the Fran&ccedil;ais,
where, on the birthday of Moli&egrave;re, we saw his "Don
Juan" revived. At the Conservatoire we witnessed
the masterly teaching of Samson; at the Od&eacute;on saw a
new play by Ponsard, done but indifferently; at the
Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s "Gentil-Bernard," with four grisettes as if
stepped out of a picture by Watteau; at the Gymnase
"Clarisse Harlowe," with a death-scene of Rose Cheri
which comes back to me, through the distance of time,
as the prettiest piece of pure and gentle stage-pathos
in my memory; at the Porte St. Martin "Lucretia
Borgia" by Hugo; at the Cirque, scenes of the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_331" id="Page_2_331">[331]</a></span>
revolution, and all the battles of Napoleon; at the
Comic Opera, "Gibby"; and at the Palais Royal the
usual new-year's piece, in which Alexandre Dumas was
shown in his study beside a pile of quarto volumes five
feet high, which proved to be the first tableau of the
first act of the first piece to be played on the first night
of his new theatre. That new theatre, the Historique,
we also saw verging to a very short-lived completeness;
and we supped with Dumas himself, and Eug&egrave;ne Sue,
and met Th&eacute;ophile Gautier and Alphonse Karr. We
saw Lamartine also, and had much friendly intercourse
with Scribe, and with the kind good-natured Amed&eacute;e
Pichot. One day we visited in the Rue du Bac the
sick and ailing Chateaubriand, whom we thought like
Basil Montagu; found ourselves at the other extreme
of opinion in the sculpture-room of David d'Angers;
and closed that day at the house of Victor Hugo, by
whom Dickens was received with infinite courtesy and
grace. The great writer then occupied a floor in a
noble corner-house in the Place Royale, the old quarter
of Ninon l'Enclos and the people of the Regency, of
whom the gorgeous tapestries, the painted ceilings, the
wonderful carvings and old golden furniture, including
a canopy of state out of some palace of the middle age,
quaintly and grandly reminded us. He was himself,
however, the best thing we saw; and I find it difficult
to associate the attitudes and aspect in which the world
has lately wondered at him, with the sober grace and
self-possessed quiet gravity of that night of twenty-five
years ago. Just then Louis Philippe had ennobled him,
but the man's nature was written noble. Rather under
the middle size, of compact close-buttoned-up figure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_332" id="Page_2_332">[332]</a></span>
with ample dark hair falling loosely over his close-shaven
face, I never saw upon any features so keenly
intellectual such a soft and sweet gentility, and certainly
never heard the French language spoken with
the picturesque distinctness given to it by Victor Hugo.
He talked of his childhood in Spain, and of his father
having been Governor of the Tagus in Napoleon's wars;
spoke warmly of the English people and their literature;
declared his preference for melody and simplicity
over the music then fashionable at the Conservatoire;
referred kindly to Ponsard, laughed at the actors who
had murdered his tragedy at the Od&eacute;on, and sympathized
with the dramatic venture of Dumas. To Dickens
he addressed very charming flattery, in the best taste;
and my friend long remembered the enjoyment of that
evening.</p>

<p>There is little to add of our Paris holiday, if indeed
too much has not been said already. We had an adventure
with a drunken coachman, of which the sequel
showed at least the vigour and decisiveness of the police
in regard to hired vehicles<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> in those last days of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_333" id="Page_2_333">[333]</a></span>
Orleans monarchy. At the Biblioth&egrave;que Royale we were
much interested by seeing, among many other priceless
treasures, Gutenberg's types, Racine's notes in his
copy of Sophocles, Rousseau's music, and Voltaire's
note upon Frederick of Prussia's letter. Nor should I
omit that in what Dickens then told me, of even his
small experience of the social aspects of Paris, there
seemed but the same disease which raged afterwards
through the second Empire. Not many days after I
left, all Paris was crowding to the sale of a lady of the
demi-monde, Marie du Plessis, who had led the most
brilliant and abandoned of lives, and left behind her
the most exquisite furniture and the most voluptuous
and sumptuous bijouterie. Dickens wished at one time
to have pointed the moral of this life and death of
which there was great talk in Paris while we were together.
The disease of satiety, which only less often
than hunger passes for a broken heart, had killed her.
"What do you want?" asked the most famous of the
Paris physicians, at a loss for her exact complaint. At
last she answered: "To see my mother." She was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_334" id="Page_2_334">[334]</a></span>
sent for; and there came a simple Breton peasant-woman
clad in the quaint garb of her province, who
prayed by her bed until she died. Wonderful was the
admiration and sympathy; and it culminated when
Eug&egrave;ne Sue bought her prayer-book at the sale. Our
last talk before I quitted Paris, after dinner at the Embassy,
was of the danger underlying all this, and of the
signs also visible everywhere of the Napoleon-worship
which the Orleanists themselves had most favoured.
Accident brought Dickens to England a fortnight later,
when again we met together, at Gore-house, the self-contained
reticent man whose doubtful inheritance was
thus rapidly preparing to fall to him.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>The accident was the having underwritten his number
of <i>Dombey</i> by two pages, which there was not time to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_335" id="Page_2_335">[335]</a></span>
supply otherwise than by coming to London to write
them.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> This was done accordingly; but another
greater trouble followed. He had hardly returned to
Paris when his eldest son, whom I had brought to
England with me and placed in the house of Doctor
Major, then head-master of King's-college-school, was
attacked by scarlet fever; and this closed prematurely
Dickens's residence in Paris. But though he and his
wife at once came over, and were followed after some
days by the children and their aunt, the isolation of
the little invalid could not so soon be broken through.
His father at last saw him, nearly a month before the
rest, in a lodging in Albany-street, where his grandmother,
Mrs. Hogarth, had devoted herself to the
charge of him; and an incident of the visit, which
amused us all very much, will not unfitly introduce the
subject that waits me in my next chapter.</p>

<p>An elderly charwoman employed about the place
had shown so much sympathy in the family trouble,
that Mrs. Hogarth specially told her of the approaching
visit, and who it was that was coming to the sick-room.
"Lawk ma'am!" she said. "Is the young
gentleman upstairs the son of the man that put together
<i>Dombey?</i>" Reassured upon this point, she explained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_336" id="Page_2_336">[336]</a></span>
her question by declaring that she never thought there
was a man that <i>could</i> have put together <i>Dombey</i>. Being
pressed farther as to what her notion was of this mystery
of a <i>Dombey</i> (for it was known she could not
read), it turned out that she lodged at a snuff-shop
kept by a person named Douglas, where there were
several other lodgers; and that on the first Monday
of every month there was a Tea, and the landlord read
the month's number of <i>Dombey</i>, those only of the
lodgers who subscribed to the tea partaking of that
luxury, but all having the benefit of the reading; and
the impression produced on the old charwoman revealed
itself in the remark with which she closed her
account of it. "Lawk ma'am! I thought that three
or four men must have put together <i>Dombey!</i>"</p>

<p>Dickens thought there was something of a compliment
in this, and was not ungrateful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> his proposed new "book in shilling numbers"
had been mentioned to me three months before
he quitted England, he knew little himself at that time
or when he left excepting the fact, then also named,
that it was to do with Pride what its predecessor had
done with Selfishness. But this limit he soon overpassed;
and the succession of independent groups of
character, surprising for the variety of their forms and
handling, with which he enlarged and enriched his
plan, went far beyond the range of the passion of Mr.
Dombey and Mr. Dombey's second wife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_338" id="Page_2_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>Obvious causes have led to grave under-estimates of
this novel. Its first five numbers forced up interest
and expectation so high that the rest of necessity fell
short; but it is not therefore true of the general conception
that thus the wine of it had been drawn, and
only the lees left. In the treatment of acknowledged
masterpieces in literature it not seldom occurs that the
genius and the art of the master have not pulled together
to the close; but if a work of imagination is to
forfeit its higher meed of praise because its pace at
starting has not been uniformly kept, hard measure
would have to be dealt to books of undeniable greatness.
Among other critical severities it was said here,
that Paul died at the beginning not for any need of
the story, but only to interest its readers somewhat
more; and that Mr. Dombey relented at the end for
just the same reason. What is now to be told will
show how little ground existed for either imputation.
The so-called "violent change" in the hero has more
lately been revived in the notices of Mr. Taine,
who says of it that "<i>it spoils a fine novel;</i>" but it will
be seen that in the apparent change no unnaturalness
of change was involved, and certainly the adoption of
it was not a sacrifice to "public morality." While
every other portion of the tale had to submit to such
varieties in development as the characters themselves
entailed, the design affecting Paul and his father had
been planned from the opening, and was carried without
alteration to the close. And of the perfect honesty
with which Dickens himself repelled such charges as
those to which I have adverted, when he wrote the
preface to his collected edition, remarkable proof appears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_339" id="Page_2_339">[339]</a></span>
in the letter to myself which accompanied the
manuscript of his proposed first number. No other
line of the tale had at this time been placed on paper.</p>

<p>When the first chapter only was done, and again
when all was finished but eight slips, he had sent me
letters formerly quoted. What follows came with the
manuscript of the first four chapters on the 25th of July.
"I will now go on to give you an outline of my immediate
intentions in reference to <i>Dombey</i>. I design
to show Mr. D. with that one idea of the Son taking
firmer and firmer possession of him, and swelling and
bloating his pride to a prodigious extent. As the
boy begins to grow up, I shall show him quite impatient
for his getting on, and urging his masters to set
him great tasks, and the like. But the natural affection
of the boy will turn towards the despised sister;
and I purpose showing her learning all sorts of things,
of her own application and determination, to assist
him in his lessons; and helping him always. When the
boy is about ten years old (in the fourth number), he
will be taken ill, and will die; and when he is ill, and
when he is dying, I mean to make him turn always for
refuge to the sister still, and keep the stern affection of
the father at a distance. So Mr. Dombey&mdash;for all his
greatness, and for all his devotion to the child&mdash;will
find himself at arms' length from him even then; and
will see that his love and confidence are all bestowed
upon his sister, whom Mr. Dombey has used&mdash;and so
has the boy himself too, for that matter&mdash;as a mere
convenience and handle to him. The death of the boy
is a death-blow, of course, to all the father's schemes
and cherished hopes; and 'Dombey and Son,' as Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_340" id="Page_2_340">[340]</a></span>
Tox will say at the end of the number, 'is a Daughter
after all.'&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From that time, I purpose changing his
feeling of indifference and uneasiness towards his
daughter into a positive hatred. For he will always
remember how the boy had his arm round her neck
when he was dying, and whispered to her, and would
take things only from her hand, and never thought of
him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. At the same time I shall change <i>her</i> feeling
towards <i>him</i> for one of a greater desire to love him,
and to be loved by him; engendered in her compassion
for his loss, and her love for the dead boy whom, in
his way, he loved so well too. So I mean to carry the
story on, through all the branches and offshoots and
meanderings that come up; and through the decay
and downfall of the house, and the bankruptcy of
Dombey, and all the rest of it; when his only staff
and treasure, and his unknown Good Genius always,
will be this rejected daughter, who will come out better
than any son at last, and whose love for him, when discovered
and understood, will be his bitterest reproach.
For the struggle with himself which goes on in all such
obstinate natures, will have ended then; and the sense
of his injustice, which you may be sure has never quitted
him, will have at last a gentler office than that of only
making him more harshly unjust.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I rely very
much on Susan Nipper grown up, and acting partly as
Florence's maid, and partly as a kind of companion to
her, for a strong character throughout the book. I also
rely on the Toodles, and on Polly, who, like everybody
else, will be found by Mr. Dombey to have gone
over to his daughter and become attached to her. This
is what cooks call 'the stock of the soup.' All kinds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_341" id="Page_2_341">[341]</a></span>
of things will be added to it, of course." Admirable
is the illustration thus afforded of his way of working,
and very interesting the evidence it gives of the genuine
feeling for his art with which this book was begun.</p>

<p>The close of the letter put an important question
affecting gravely a leading person in the tale.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
"About the boy, who appears in the last chapter of the
first number, I think it would be a good thing to disappoint
all the expectations that chapter seems to raise
of his happy connection with the story and the heroine,
and to show him gradually and naturally trailing away,
from that love of adventure and boyish light-heartedness,
into negligence, idleness, dissipation, dishonesty,
and ruin. To show, in short, that common, every-day,
miserable declension of which we know so much in our
ordinary life; to exhibit something of the philosophy of
it, in great temptations and an easy nature; and to show
how the good turns into bad, by degrees. If I kept some
little notion of Florence always at the bottom of it, I
think it might be made very powerful and very useful.
What do you think? Do you think it may be done,
without making people angry? I could bring out Solomon
Gills and Captain Cuttle well, through such a history;
and I descry, anyway, an opportunity for good
scenes between Captain Cuttle and Miss Tox. This
question of the boy is very important.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let me hear
all you think about it. Hear! I wish I could."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>For reasons that need not be dwelt upon here, but
in which Dickens ultimately acquiesced, Walter was
reserved for a happier future; and the idea thrown
out took subsequent shape, amid circumstances better
suited to its excellent capabilities, in the striking character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_342" id="Page_2_342">[342]</a></span>
of Richard Carstone in the tale of <i>Bleak House</i>.
But another point had risen meanwhile for settlement
not admitting of delay. In the first enjoyment of writing
after his long rest, to which a former letter has referred,
he had over-written his number by nearly a fifth; and
upon his proposal to transfer the fourth chapter to his
second number, replacing it by another of fewer pages,
I had to object that this might damage his interest at
starting. Thus he wrote on the 7th of August: ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
have received your letter to-day with the greatest delight,
and am overjoyed to find that you think so well
of the number. I thought well of it myself, and that
it was a great plunge into a story; but I did not know
how far I might be stimulated by my paternal affection.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
What should you say, for a notion of the illustrations,
to 'Miss Tox introduces the Party?' and
'Mr. Dombey and family?' meaning Polly Toodle,
the baby, Mr. Dombey, and little Florence: whom I
think it would be well to have. Walter, his uncle, and
Captain Cuttle, might stand over. It is a great question
with me, now, whether I had not better take this
last chapter bodily out, and make it the last chapter of
the second number; writing some other new one to
close the first number. I think it would be impossible
to take out six pages without great pangs. Do you
think such a proceeding as I suggest would weaken
number one very much? I wish you would tell me, as
soon as you can after receiving this, what your opinion
is on the point. If you thought it would weaken the
first number, beyond the counterbalancing advantage
of strengthening the second, I would cut down somehow
or other, and let it go. I shall be anxious to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_343" id="Page_2_343">[343]</a></span>
hear your opinion. In the meanwhile I will go on
with the second, which I have just begun. I have
not been quite myself since we returned from Chamounix,
owing to the great heat." Two days later:
"I have begun a little chapter to end the first number,
and certainly think it will be well to keep the ten
pages of Wally and Co. entire for number two. But
this is still subject to your opinion, which I am very
anxious to know. I have not been in writing cue all
the week; but really the weather has rendered it next
to impossible to work." Four days later: "I shall
send you with this (on the chance of your being favourable
to that view of the subject) a small chapter
to close the first number, in lieu of the Solomon Gills
one. I have been hideously idle all the week, and
have done nothing but this trifling interloper: but
hope to begin again on Monday&mdash;ding dong.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
inkstand is to be cleaned out to-night, and refilled, preparatory
to execution. I trust I may shed a good deal
of ink in the next fortnight." Then, the day following,
on arrival of my letter, he submitted to a hard
necessity. "I received yours to-day. A decided facer
to me! I had been counting, alas! with a miser's
greed, upon the gained ten pages.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No matter. I
have no doubt you are right, and strength is everything.
The addition of two lines to each page, or
something less,&mdash;coupled with the enclosed cuts, will
bring it all to bear smoothly. In case more cutting is
wanted, I must ask you to try your hand. I shall agree
to whatever you propose." These cuttings, absolutely
necessary as they were, were not without much disadvantage;
and in the course of them he had to sacrifice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_344" id="Page_2_344">[344]</a></span>
a passage foreshadowing his final intention as to
Dombey. It would have shown, thus early, something
of the struggle with itself that such pride must always
go through; and I think it worth preserving in a note.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Several letters now expressed his anxiety and care
about the illustrations. A nervous dread of caricature
in the face of his merchant-hero, had led him to indicate
by a living person the type of city-gentleman he
would have had the artist select; and this is all he
meant by his reiterated urgent request, "I do wish he
could get a glimpse of A, for he is the very Dombey."
But as the glimpse of A was not to be had, it was resolved
to send for selection by himself glimpses of other
letters of the alphabet, actual heads as well as fanciful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_347" id="Page_2_347">[347]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_346" id="Page_2_346">[346]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_345" id="Page_2_345">[345]</a></span>
ones; and the sheetful I sent out, which he returned
when the choice was made, I here reproduce in fac-simile.
In itself amusing, it has now the important
use of showing, once for all, in regard to Dickens's
intercourse with his artists, that they certainly had not
an easy time with him; that, even beyond what is
ordinary between author and illustrator, his requirements
were exacting; that he was apt, as he has said
himself, to build up temples in his mind not always
makeable with hands; that in the results he had rarely
anything but disappointment; and that of all notions
to connect with him the most preposterous would be
that which directly reversed these relations, and depicted
him as receiving from any artist the inspiration
he was always vainly striving to give. An assertion of
this kind was contradicted in my first volume; but it
has since been repeated so explicitly, that to prevent
any possible misconstruction from a silence I would
fain have persisted in, the distasteful subject is again
reluctantly introduced.</p>

</div>
<p>It originated with a literary friend of the excellent
artist by whom <i>Oliver Twist</i> was illustrated from month
to month, during the earlier part of its monthly issue.
This gentleman stated, in a paper written and published
in America, that Mr. Cruikshank, by executing the
plates before opportunity was afforded him of seeing
the letter press, had suggested to the writer the finest
effects in his story; and to this, opposing my clear recollection
of all the time the tale was in progress, it
became my duty to say that within my own personal
knowledge the alleged fact was not true. "Dickens,"
the artist is reported an saying to his admirer, "ferreted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_348" id="Page_2_348">[348]</a></span>
out that bundle of drawings, and when he came to the
one which represents Fagin in the cell, he silently
studied it for half an hour, and told me he was tempted
to change the whole plot of his story.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I consented
to let him write up to my designs; and that was the
way in which Fagin, Sikes, and Nancy were created."
Happily I was able to add the complete refutation of
this folly by producing a letter of Dickens written at
the time, which proved incontestably that the closing
illustrations, including the two specially named in support
of the preposterous charge, Sikes and his Dog, and
Fagin in his Cell, had not even been seen by Dickens
until his finished book was on the eve of appearance.
As however the distinguished artist, notwithstanding
the refreshment of his memory by this letter, has permitted
himself again to endorse the statement of his
friend, I can only again print, on the same page which
contains the strange language used by him, the words
with which Dickens himself repels its imputation on
his memory. To some it may be more satisfactory if
I print the latter in fac-simile; and so leave for ever a
charge in itself so incredible that nothing would have
justified farther allusion to it but the knowledge of my
friend's old and true regard for Mr. Cruikshank, of
which evidence will shortly appear, and my own respect
for an original genius well able to subsist of itself without
taking what belongs to others.</p>

<p>Resuming the <i>Dombey</i> letters I find him on the 30th
of August in better heart about his illustrator. "I shall
gladly acquiesce in whatever more changes or omissions
you propose. Browne seems to be getting on well.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
He will have a good subject in Paul's christening. Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_351" id="Page_2_351">[351]</a></span>
of it. The little chapter of Miss Tox and the Major,
which you alas! (but quite wisely) rejected from the
first number, I have altered for the last of the second.
I have not quite finished the middle chapter yet&mdash;having,
I should say, three good days' work to do at
it; but I hope it will be all a worthy successor to number
one. I will send it as soon as finished." Then,
a little later: "Browne is certainly interesting himself,
and taking pains. I think the cover very good: perhaps
with a little too much in it, but that is an ungrateful
objection." The second week of September brought
me the finished MS. of number two; and his letter of
the 3rd of October, noticing objections taken to it,
gives additional touches to this picture of him while at
work. The matter that engages him is one of his masterpieces.
There is nothing in all his writings more
perfect, for what it shows of his best qualities, than
the life and death of Paul Dombey. The comedy is
admirable; nothing strained, everything hearty and
wholesome in the laughter and fun; all who contribute
to the mirth, Doctor Blimber and his pupils, Mr. Toots,
the Chicks and the Toodles, Miss Tox and the Major,
Paul and Mrs. Pipchin, up to his highest mark; and
the serious scenes never falling short of it, from the
death of Paul's mother in the first number, to that of
Paul himself in the fifth, which, as a writer of genius<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_352" id="Page_2_352">[352]</a></span>
with hardly exaggeration said, threw a whole nation
into mourning. But see how eagerly this fine writer
takes every suggestion, how little of self-esteem and
self-sufficiency there is, with what a consciousness of
the tendency of his humour to exuberance he surrenders
what is needful to restrain it, and of what small
account to him is any special piece of work in his care
and his considerateness for the general design. I
think of Ben Jonson's experience of the greatest of all
writers. "He was indeed honest, and of an open and
free nature; had an excellent phantasy, brave notions
and gentle expressions; wherein he flowed with that
facility, that sometimes it was necessary he should be
stopped." Who it was that stopped <i>him</i>, and the ease
of doing it, no one will doubt. Whether he, as well
as the writer of later time, might not with more advantage
have been left alone, will be the only question.</p>

<p>Thus ran the letter of the 3rd of October: "Miss
Tox's colony I will smash. Walter's allusion to Carker
(would you take it <i>all</i> out?) shall be dele'd. Of course,
you understand the man! I turned that speech over in
my mind; but I thought it natural that a boy should
run on, with such a subject, under the circumstances:
having the matter so presented to him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I thought
of the possibility of malice on christening points of
faith, and put the drag on as I wrote. Where would
you make the insertion, and to what effect? <i>That</i>
shall be done too. I want you to think the number
sufficiently good stoutly to back up the first. It occurs
to me&mdash;might not your doubt about the christening be
a reason for not making the ceremony the subject of an
illustration? Just turn this over. Again: if I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_353" id="Page_2_353">[353]</a></span>
do it (I shall have leisure to consider the possibility
before I begin), do you think it would be advisable to
make number three a kind of half-way house between
Paul's infancy, and his being eight or nine years old?&mdash;In
that case I should probably not kill him until the
fifth number. Do you think the people so likely to be
pleased with Florence, and Walter, as to relish another
number of them at their present age? Otherwise,
Walter will be two or three and twenty, straightway.
I wish you would think of this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am sure you are
right about the christening. It shall be artfully and
easily amended.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Eh?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, two days before this letter, his first number
had been launched with a sale that transcended his
hopes and brought back <i>Nickleby</i> days. The <i>Dombey</i>
success "is <span class="smcap">brilliant</span>!" he wrote to me on the 11th.
"I had put before me thirty thousand as the limit of
the most extreme success, saying that if we should
reach that, I should be more than satisfied and more
than happy; you will judge how happy I am! I read
the second number here last night to the most prodigious
and uproarious delight of the circle. I never
saw or heard people laugh so. You will allow me to
observe that my reading of the Major has merit."
What a valley of the shadow he had just been passing,
in his journey through his Christmas book, has before
been told; but always, and with only too much eagerness,
he sprang up under pressure. "A week of perfect
idleness," he wrote to me on the 26th, "has brought
me round again&mdash;idleness so rusting and devouring, so
complete and unbroken, that I am quite glad to write
the heading of the first chapter of number three to-day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_354" id="Page_2_354">[354]</a></span>
I shall be slow at first, I fear, in consequence
of that change of the plan. But I allow myself nearly
three weeks for the number; designing, at present, to
start for Paris on the 16th of November. Full particulars
in future bills. Just going to bed. I think
I can make a good effect, on the after story, of the
feeling created by the additional number before Paul's
death." .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Five more days confirmed him in this hope.
"I am at work at <i>Dombey</i> with good speed, thank
God. All well here. Country stupendously beautiful.
Mountains covered with snow. Rich, crisp weather."
There was one drawback. The second number had
gone out to him, and the illustrations he found to
be so "dreadfully bad" that they made him "curl
his legs up." They made him also more than usually
anxious in regard to a special illustration on which he
set much store, for the part he had in hand.</p>

<p>The first chapter of it was sent me only four days
later (nearly half the entire part, so freely his fancy
was now flowing and overflowing), with intimation for
the artist: "The best subject for Browne will be at
Mrs. Pipchin's; and if he liked to do a quiet odd
thing, Paul, Mrs. Pipchin, and the Cat, by the fire,
would be very good for the story. I earnestly hope
he will think it worth a little extra care. The second
subject, in case he shouldn't take a second from that
same chapter, I will shortly describe as soon as I have
it clearly (to-morrow or next day), and send it to <i>you</i>
by post." The result was not satisfactory; but as the
artist more than redeemed it in the later course of the
tale, and the present disappointment was mainly the
incentive to that better success, the mention of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_355" id="Page_2_355">[355]</a></span>
failure here will be excused for what it illustrates of
Dickens himself. "I am really <i>distressed</i> by the illustration
of Mrs. Pipchin and Paul. It is so frightfully
and wildly wide of the mark. Good Heaven! in the
commonest and most literal construction of the text,
it is all wrong. She is described as an old lady, and
Paul's 'miniature arm-chair' is mentioned more than
once. He ought to be sitting in a little arm-chair
down in the corner of the fireplace, staring up at her.
I can't say what pain and vexation it is to be so utterly
misrepresented. I would cheerfully have given a hundred
pounds to have kept this illustration out of the
book. He never could have got that idea of Mrs.
Pipchin if he had attended to the text. Indeed I
think he does better without the text; for then the
notion is made easy to him in short description, and
he can't help taking it in."</p>

<p>He felt the disappointment more keenly, because the
conception of the grim old boarding-house keeper had
taken back his thoughts to the miseries of his own child-life,
and made her, as her prototype in verity was, a
part of the terrible reality.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> I had forgotten, until I
again read this letter of the 4th of November 1846, that
he thus early proposed to tell me that story of his boyish
sufferings which a question from myself, of some
months later date, so fully elicited. He was now hastening
on with the close of his third number, to be ready
for departure to Paris.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_356" id="Page_2_356">[356]</a></span></p>
<p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hope to finish the number by next Tuesday
or Wednesday. It is hard writing under these bird-of-passage
circumstances, but I have no reason to complain,
God knows, having come to no knot yet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
hope you will like Mrs. Pipchin's establishment. It is
from the life, and I was there&mdash;I don't suppose I was
eight years old; but I remember it all as well, and certainly
understood it as well, as I do now. We should
be devilish sharp in what we do to children. I thought
of that passage in my small life, at Geneva. <i>Shall I leave
you my life in MS. when I die? There are some things in
it that would touch you very much, and that might go
on the same shelf with the first volume of Holcroft's.</i>"</p>

<p>On the Monday week after that was written he left
Lausanne for Paris, and my first letter to him there was
to say that he had overwritten his number by three
pages. "I have taken out about two pages and a half,"
he wrote by return from the hotel Brighton, "and the
rest I must ask you to take out with the assurance that
you will satisfy me in whatever you do. The sale, prodigious
indeed! I am very thankful." Next day he
wrote as to Walter. "I see it will be best as you
advise, to give that idea up; and indeed I don't feel it
would be reasonable to carry it out now. I am far from
sure it could be wholesomely done, after the interest he
has acquired. But when I have disposed of Paul (poor
boy!) I will consider the subject farther." The subject
was never resumed. He was at the opening of his admirable
fourth part, when, on the 6th of December, he
wrote from the Rue de Courcelles: "Here am I, writing
letters, and delivering opinions, politico-economical
and otherwise, as if there were no undone number,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_357" id="Page_2_357">[357]</a></span>
and no undone Dick! Well. Cosi va il mondo (God
bless me! Italian! I beg your pardon)&mdash;and one
must keep one's spirits up, if possible, even under <i>Dombey</i>
pressure. Paul, I shall slaughter at the end of
number five. His school ought to be pretty good, but
I haven't been able to dash at it freely, yet. However,
I have avoided unnecessary dialogue so far, to avoid
overwriting; and all I <i>have</i> written is point."</p>

<p>And so, in "point," it went to the close; the rich
humour of its picture of Doctor Blimber and his pupils
alternating with the quaint pathos of its picture of little
Paul; the first a good-natured exposure of the forcing-system
and its fruits, as useful as the sterner revelation in
<i>Nickleby</i> of the atrocities of Mr. Squeers, and the last
even less attractive for the sweetness and sadness of its
foreshadowing of a child's death, than for those strange
images of a vague, deep thoughtfulness, of a shrewd unconscious
intellect, of mysterious small philosophies and
questionings, by which the young old-fashioned little
creature has a glamour thrown over him as he is passing
away. It was wonderfully original, this treatment of the
part that thus preceded the close of Paul's little life; and
of which the first conception, as I have shown, was an
afterthought. It quite took the death itself out of the
region of pathetic commonplaces, and gave to it the
proper relation to the sorrow of the little sister that survives
it. It is a fairy vision to a piece of actual suffering;
a sorrow with heaven's hues upon it, to a sorrow
with all the bitterness of earth.</p>

<p>The number had been finished, he had made his
visit to London, and was again in the Rue de Courcelles,
when on Christmas day he sent me its hearty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_358" id="Page_2_358">[358]</a></span>
old wishes, and a letter of Jeffrey's on his new story of
which the first and second part had reached him.
"Many merry Christmases, many happy new years,
unbroken friendship, great accumulation of cheerful
recollections, affection on earth, and Heaven at last!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Is it not a strange example of the hazard of writing
in parts, that a man like Jeffrey should form his notion
of Dombey and Miss Tox on three months' knowledge?
I have asked him the same question, and advised him
to keep his eye on both of them as time rolls on.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_359" id="Page_2_359">[359]</a></span>
do not at heart, however, lay much real stress on his
opinion, though one is naturally proud of awakening
such sincere interest in the breast of an old man who
has so long worn the blue and yellow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He certainly
did some service in his old criticisms, especially
to Crabbe. And though I don't think so highly of
Crabbe as I once did (feeling a dreary want of fancy
in his poems), I think he deserved the pains-taking
and conscientious tracking with which Jeffrey followed
him".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Six days later he described himself sitting
down to the performance of one of his greatest achievements,
his number five, "most abominably dull and
stupid. I have only written a slip, but I hope to get to
work in strong earnest to-morrow. It occurred to me
on special reflection, that the first chapter should be
with Paul and Florence, and that it should leave a
pleasant impression of the little fellow being happy,
before the reader is called upon to see him die. I mean
to have a genteel breaking-up at Doctor Blimber's
therefore, for the Midsummer vacation; and to show
him in a little quiet light (now dawning through the
chinks of my mind), which I hope will create an agreeable
impression." Then, two days later: ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am
working very slowly. You will see in the first two or
three lines of the enclosed first subject, with what idea
I am ploughing along. It is difficult; but a new way
of doing it, it strikes me, and likely to be pretty."</p>

<p>And then, after three days more, came something of
a damper to his spirits, as he thus toiled along. He
saw public allusion made to a review that had appeared
in the <i>Times</i> of his Christmas book, and it momentarily
touched what he too truly called his morbid susceptibility<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_360" id="Page_2_360">[360]</a></span>
to exasperation. "I see that the 'good old
Times' are again at issue with the inimitable B.
Another touch of a blunt razor on B.'s nervous system.&mdash;Friday
morning. Inimitable very mouldy and dull.
Hardly able to work. Dreamed of <i>Timeses</i> all night.
Disposed to go to New Zealand and start a magazine."
But soon he sprang up, as usual, more erect for the
moment's pressure; and after not many days I heard
that the number was as good as done. His letter was
very brief, and told me that he had worked so hard the
day before (Tuesday, the 12th of January), and so incessantly,
night as well as morning, that he had breakfasted
and lain in bed till midday. "I hope I have
been very successful." There was but one small chapter
more to write, in which he and his little friend were
to part company for ever; and the greater part of the
night of the day on which it was written, Thursday the
14th, he was wandering desolate and sad about the
streets of Paris. I arrived there the following morning
on my visit; and as I alighted from the malle-poste,
a little before eight o'clock, found him waiting
for me at the gate of the post-office bureau.</p>

<p>I left him on the 2nd of February with his writing-table
in readiness for number six; but on the 4th, enclosing
me subjects for illustration, he told me he was
"not under weigh yet. Can't begin." Then, on the
7th, his birthday, he wrote to warn me he should be
late. "Could not begin before Thursday last, and
find it very difficult indeed to fall into the new vein of
the story. I see no hope of finishing before the 16th
at the earliest, in which case the steam will have to be
put on for this short month. But it can't be helped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_361" id="Page_2_361">[361]</a></span>
Perhaps I shall get a rush of inspiration.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I will
send the chapters as I write them, and you must not
wait, of course, for me to read the end in type. To
transfer to Florence, instantly, all the previous interest,
is what I am aiming at. For that, all sorts of other
points must be thrown aside in this number.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We
are going to dine again at the Embassy to-day&mdash;with
a very ill will on my part. All well. I hope when I
write next I shall report myself in better cue.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
have had a tremendous outpouring from Jeffrey about
the last part, which he thinks the best thing past,
present, or to come."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Three more days and I had
the MS. of the completed chapter, nearly half the
number (in which as printed it stands second, the small
middle chapter having been transposed to its place).
"I have taken the most prodigious pains with it; the
difficulty, immediately after Paul's death, being very
great. May you like it! My head aches over it now
(I write at one o'clock in the morning), and I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_362" id="Page_2_362">[362]</a></span>
strange to it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think I shall manage Dombey's
second wife (introduced by the Major), and the beginning
of that business in his present state of mind, very
naturally and well.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Paul's death has amazed Paris.
All sorts of people are open-mouthed with admiration.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
When I have done, I'll write you <i>such</i> a letter!
Don't cut me short in your letters just now, because
I'm working hard.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>I</i>'ll make up.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Snow&mdash;snow&mdash;snow&mdash;a
foot thick." The day after this, came the
brief chapter which was printed as the first; and then,
on the 16th, which he had fixed as his limit for completion,
the close reached me; but I had meanwhile
sent him out so much of the proof as convinced him
that he had underwritten his number by at least two
pages, and determined him to come to London. The
incident has been told which soon after closed his residence
abroad, and what remained of his story was
written in England.</p>

<p>I shall not farther dwell upon it in any detail. It
extended over the whole of the year; and the interest
and passion of it, when to himself both became centred
in Florence and in Edith Dombey, took stronger hold
of him, and more powerfully affected him, than had
been the case in any of his previous writings, I think,
excepting only the close of the <i>Old Curiosity Shop</i>.
Jeffrey compared Florence to little Nell, but the differences
from the outset are very marked, and it is rather
in what disunites or separates them that we seem to
find the purpose aimed at. If the one, amid much
strange and grotesque violence surrounding her, expresses
the innocent, unconsciousness of childhood to
such rough ways of the world, passing unscathed as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_363" id="Page_2_363">[363]</a></span>
Una to her home beyond it, the other is this character
in action and resistance, a brave young resolute heart
that will <i>not</i> be crushed, and neither sinks nor yields,
but from earth's roughest trials works out her own redemption
even here. Of Edith from the first Jeffrey
judged more rightly; and, when the story was nearly
half done, expressed his opinion about her, and about
the book itself, in language that pleased Dickens for
the special reason that at the time this part of the book
had seemed to many to have fallen greatly short of the
splendour of its opening. Jeffrey said however quite
truly, claiming to be heard with authority as his "Critic-laureate,"
that of all his writings it was perhaps the
most finished in diction, and that it equalled the best
in the delicacy and fineness of its touches, "while it
rises to higher and deeper passions, not resting, like
most of the former, in sweet thoughtfulness, and thrilling
and attractive tenderness, but boldly wielding all
the lofty and terrible elements of tragedy, and bringing
before us the appalling struggles of a proud, scornful,
and repentant spirit." Not that she was exactly
this. Edith's worst qualities are but the perversion of
what should have been her best. A false education in
her, and a tyrant passion in her husband, make them
other than Nature meant; and both show how life may
run its evil course against the higher dispensations.</p>

<p>As the catastrophe came in view, a nice point in the
management of her character and destiny arose. I
quote from a letter of the 19th of November, when he
was busy with his fourteenth part. "Of course she
hates Carker in the most deadly degree. I have not
elaborated that, now, because (as I was explaining to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_364" id="Page_2_364">[364]</a></span>
Browne the other day) I have relied on it very much
for the effect of her death. But I have no question
that what you suggest will be an improvement. The
strongest place to put it in, would be the close of the
chapter immediately before this last one. I want to
make the two first chapters as light as I can, but I will
try to do it, solemnly, in that place." Then came the
effect of this fourteenth number on Jeffrey; raising the
question of whether the end might not come by other
means than her death, and bringing with it a more
bitter humiliation for her destroyer. While engaged
on the fifteenth (21st December) Dickens thus wrote
to me: "I am thoroughly delighted that you like what
I sent. I enclose designs. Shadow-plate, poor. But
I think Mr. Dombey admirable. One of the prettiest
things in the book ought to be at the end of the chapter
I am writing now. But in Florence's marriage, and
in her subsequent return to her father, I see a brilliant
opportunity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Note from Jeffrey this morning, who
won't believe (positively refuses) that Edith is Carker's
mistress. What do you think of a kind of inverted
Maid's Tragedy, and a tremendous scene of her undeceiving
Carker, and giving him to know that she never
meant that?" So it was done; and when he sent me
the chapter in which Edith says adieu to Florence, I
had nothing but praise and pleasure to express. "I
need not say," he wrote in reply, "I can't, how delighted
and overjoyed I am by what you say and feel
of it. I propose to show Dombey <i>twice</i> more; and in
the end, leave him exactly as you describe." The end
came; and, at the last moment when correction was
possible, this note arrived. "I suddenly remember<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_365" id="Page_2_365">[365]</a></span>
that I have forgotten Diogenes. Will you put him in the
last little chapter? After the word 'favourite' in reference
to Miss Tox, you can add, 'except with Diogenes,
who is growing old and wilful.' Or, on the last page of
all, after 'and with them two children: boy and girl' (I
quote from memory), you might say 'and an old dog
is generally in their company,' or to that effect. Just
what you think best."</p>

<p>That was on Saturday the 25th of March, 1848, and
may be my last reference to <i>Dombey</i> until the book, in
its place with the rest, finds critical allusion when I
close. But as the confidences revealed in this chapter
have dealt wholly with the leading currents of interest,
there is yet room for a word on incidental persons in
the story, of whom I have seen other so-called confidences
alleged which it will be only right to state have
really no authority. And first let me say what unquestionable
evidence these characters give of the unimpaired
freshness, richness, variety, and fitness of Dickens's
invention at this time. Glorious Captain Cuttle,
laying his head to the wind and fighting through everything;
his friend Jack Bunsby,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> with a head too ponderous
to lay-to, and so falling victim to the inveterate
MacStinger; good-hearted, modest, considerate Toots,
whose brains rapidly go as his whiskers come, but who
yet gets back from contact with the world, in his
shambling way, some fragments of the sense pumped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_366" id="Page_2_366">[366]</a></span>
out of him by the forcing Blimbers; breathless Susan
Nipper, beaming Polly Toodle, the plaintive Wickham,
and the awful Pipchin, each with her duty in the
starched Dombey household so nicely appointed as to
seem born for only that; simple thoughtful old Gills
and his hearty young lad of a nephew; Mr. Toodle
and his children, with the charitable grinder's decline
and fall; Miss Tox, obsequious flatterer from nothing
but good-nature; spectacled and analytic, but not
unkind Miss Blimber; and the good droning dull benevolent
Doctor himself, withering even the fruits of
his well-spread dinner-table with his <i>It is remarkable,
Mr. Feeder, that the Romans</i>&mdash;"at the mention of
which terrible people, their implacable enemies, every
young gentleman fastened his gaze upon the Doctor,
with an assumption of the deepest interest." So vivid
and life-like were all these people, to the very youngest
of the young gentlemen, that it became natural eagerly
to seek out for them actual prototypes; but I think I
can say with some confidence of them all, that, whatever
single traits may have been taken from persons
known to him (a practice with all writers, and very
specially with Dickens), only two had living originals.
His own experience of Mrs. Pipchin has been related;
I had myself some knowledge of Miss Blimber; and
the Little Wooden Midshipman did actually (perhaps
does still) occupy his post of observation in Leadenhall-street.
The names that have been connected, I doubt
not in perfect good faith, with Sol Gills, Perch the
messenger, and Captain Cuttle, have certainly not more
foundation than the fancy a courteous correspondent
favours me with, that the redoubtable Captain must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_367" id="Page_2_367">[367]</a></span>
have sat for his portrait to Charles Lamb's blustering,
loud-talking, hook-handed Mr. Mingay. As to the
amiable and excellent city-merchant whose name has
been given to Mr. Dombey, he might with the same
amount of justice or probability be supposed to have
originated <i>Coriolanus</i> or <i>Timon of Athens</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Devonshire Terrace</span> remaining still in possession
of Sir James Duke, a house was taken in Chester-place,
Regent's-park, where, on the 18th of April, his fifth
son, to whom he gave the name of Sydney Smith
Haldimand, was born.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Exactly a month before, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_369" id="Page_2_369">[369]</a></span>
had attended together the funeral, at Highgate, of his
publisher Mr. William Hall, his old regard for whom
had survived the recent temporary cloud, and with
whom he had the association as well of his first success,
as of much kindly intercourse not forgotten at
this sad time. Of the summer months that followed,
the greater part was passed by him at Brighton or
Broadstairs; and the chief employment of his leisure,
in the intervals of <i>Dombey</i>, was the management of an
enterprise originating in the success of our private
play, of which the design was to benefit a great man
of letters.</p>

<p>The purpose and the name had hardly been announced,
when, with the statesmanlike attention to
literature and its followers for which Lord John Russell
has been eccentric among English politicians, a civil-list
pension of two hundred a year was granted to
Leigh Hunt; but though this modified our plan so far
as to strike out of it performances meant to be given
in London, so much was still thought necessary as
might clear off past liabilities, and enable one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_370" id="Page_2_370">[370]</a></span>
most genuine of writers better to enjoy the easier
future that had at last been opened to him. Reserving
therefore anything realized beyond a certain sum for
a dramatic author of merit, Mr. John Poole, to whom
help had become also important, it was proposed
to give, on Leigh Hunt's behalf, two representations
of Ben Jonson's comedy, one at Manchester and the
other at Liverpool, to be varied by different farces in
each place; and with a prologue of Talfourd's which
Dickens was to deliver in Manchester, while a similar
address by Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton was to be spoken
by me in Liverpool. Among the artists and writers
associated in the scheme were Mr. Frank Stone, Mr.
Augustus Egg, Mr. John Leech, and Mr. George
Cruikshank; Mr. Douglas Jerrold, Mr. Mark Lemon,
Mr. Dudley Costello, and Mr. George Henry Lewes;
the general management and supreme control being
given to Dickens.</p>

<p>Leading men in both cities contributed largely to the
design, and my friend Mr. Alexander Ireland of Manchester
has lately sent me some letters not more characteristic
of the energy of Dickens in regard to it than of
the eagerness of every one addressed to give what help
they could. Making personal mention of his fellow-sharers
in the enterprise he describes the troop, in one
of those letters, as "the most easily governable company
of actors on earth;" and to this he had doubtless
brought them, but not very easily. One or two of his
managerial troubles at rehearsals remain on record in
letters to myself, and may give amusement still. Comedy
and farces are referred to indiscriminately, but the
farces were the most recurring plague. "Good Heaven!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_371" id="Page_2_371">[371]</a></span>
I find that A. hasn't twelve words, and I am in hourly
expectation of rebellion!"&mdash;"You were right about
the green baize, that it would certainly muffle the
voices; and some of our actors, by Jove, haven't too
much of that commodity at the best."&mdash;"B. shocked
me so much the other night by a restless, stupid movement
of his hands in his first scene with you, that I
took a turn of an hour with him yesterday morning,
and I hope quieted his nerves a little."&mdash;"I made a desperate
effort to get C. to give up his part. Yet in spite
of all the trouble he gives me I am sorry for him, he is
so evidently hurt by his own sense of not doing well.
He clutched the part, however, tenaciously; and three
weary times we dragged through it last night."&mdash;"That
infernal E. forgets everything."&mdash;"I plainly see that
F. when nervous, which he is sure to be, loses his memory.
Moreover his asides are inaudible, even at Miss
Kelly's; and as regularly as I stop him to say them
again, he exclaims (with a face of agony) that 'he'll
speak loud on the night,' as if anybody ever did without
doing it always!"&mdash;"G. not born for it at all, and
too innately conceited, I much fear, to do anything
well. I thought him better last night, but I would as
soon laugh at a kitchen poker."&mdash;"Fancy H. ten days
after the casting of that farce, wanting F.'s part therein!
Having himself an excellent old man in it already, and a
quite admirable part in the other farce." From which
it will appear that my friend's office was not a sinecure,
and that he was not, as few amateur-managers have ever
been, without the experiences of Peter Quince. Fewer
still, I suspect, have fought through them with such
perfect success, for the company turned out at last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_372" id="Page_2_372">[372]</a></span>
would have done credit to any enterprise. They deserved
the term applied to them by Maclise, who had
invented it first for Macready, on his being driven
to "star" in the provinces when his managements
in London closed. They were "splendid strollers."<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_373" id="Page_2_373">[373]</a></span></p>
<p>On Monday the 26th July we played at Manchester,
and on Wednesday the 28th at Liverpool; the comedy
being followed on the first night by <i>A Good Night's
Rest</i> and <i>Turning the Tables</i>, and on the second by
<i>Comfortable Lodgings, or Paris in 1750;</i> and the receipts
being, on the first night &pound;440 12<i>s</i>, and on the
second, &pound;463 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> But though the married members
of the company who took their wives defrayed
that part of the cost, and every one who acted paid
three pounds ten to the benefit-fund for his hotel
charges, the expenses were necessarily so great that the
profit was reduced to four hundred guineas, and, handsomely
as this realised the design, expectations had
been raised to five hundred. There was just that shade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_374" id="Page_2_374">[374]</a></span>
of disappointment, therefore, when, shortly after we
came back and Dickens had returned to Broadstairs, I
was startled by a letter from him. On the 3rd of August
he had written: "All well. Children" (who had
been going through whooping cough) "immensely improved.
Business arising out of the late blaze of
triumph, worse than ever." Then came what startled
me, the very next day. As if his business were not
enough, it had occurred to him that he might add the
much longed-for hundred pounds to the benefit-fund
by a little jeu d'esprit in form of a history of the trip,
to be published with illustrations from the artists; and
his notion was to write it in the character of Mrs.
Gamp. It was to be, in the phraseology of that
notorious woman, a new "Piljians Projiss;" and was
to bear upon the title page its description as an Account
of a late Expedition into the North, for an
Amateur Theatrical Benefit, written by Mrs. Gamp
(who was an eye-witness), Inscribed to Mrs. Harris,
Edited by Charles Dickens, and published, with illustrations
on wood by so and so, in aid of the Benefit-fund.
"What do you think of this idea for it? The
argument would be, that Mrs. Gamp, being on the eve
of an excursion to Margate as a relief from her professional
fatigues, comes to the knowledge of the intended
excursion of our party; hears that several of the ladies
concerned are in an interesting situation; and decides
to accompany the party unbeknown, in a second-class
carriage&mdash;'in case.' There, she finds a gentleman
from the Strand in a checked suit, who is going down
with the wigs"&mdash;the theatrical hair-dresser employed on
these occasions, Mr. Wilson, had eccentric points of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_375" id="Page_2_375">[375]</a></span>
character that were a fund of infinite mirth to Dickens&mdash;"and
to his politeness Mrs. Gamp is indebted for much
support and countenance during the excursion. She
will describe the whole thing in her own manner: sitting,
in each place of performance, in the orchestra,
next the gentleman who plays the kettle-drums. She
gives her critical opinion of Ben Jonson as a literary
character, and refers to the different members of the
party, in the course of her description of the trip: having
always an invincible animosity towards Jerrold, for
Caudle reasons. She addresses herself, generally, to
Mrs. Harris, to whom the book is dedicated,&mdash;but is
discursive. Amount of matter, half a sheet of <i>Dombey:</i>
may be a page or so more, but not less." Alas! it
never arrived at even that small size, but perished prematurely,
as I feared it would, from failure of the
artists to furnish needful nourishment. Of course it
could not live alone. Without suitable illustration it
must have lost its point and pleasantry. "Mac will
make a little garland of the ladies for the title-page.
Egg and Stone will themselves originate something
fanciful, and I will settle with Cruikshank and Leech.
I have no doubt the little thing will be droll and
attractive." So it certainly would have been, if the
Thanes of art had not fallen from him; but on their
desertion it had to be abandoned after the first few
pages were written. They were placed at my disposal
then; and, though the little jest has lost much of its
flavour now, I cannot find it in my heart to omit them
here. There are so many friends of Mrs. Gamp who
will rejoice at this unexpected visit from her!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_376" id="Page_2_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='center'><br />"I. MRS. GAMP'S ACCOUNT OF HER CONNEXION WITH
THIS AFFAIR.</div>

<p>"Which Mrs. Harris's own words to me, was these:
'Sairey Gamp,' she says, 'why not go to Margate?
Srimps,' says that dear creetur, 'is to your liking,
Sairey; why not go to Margate for a week, bring your
constitootion up with srimps, and come back to them
loving arts as knows and wallies of you, blooming?
Sairey,' Mrs. Harris says, 'you are but poorly. Don't
denige it, Mrs. Gamp, for books is in your looks. You
must have rest. Your mind,' she says, 'is too strong
for you; it gets you down and treads upon you, Sairey.
It is useless to disguige the fact&mdash;the blade is a wearing
out the sheets.' 'Mrs. Harris,' I says to her, 'I
could not undertake to say, and I will not deceive you
ma'am, that I am the woman I could wish to be. The
time of worrit as I had with Mrs. Colliber, the baker's
lady, which was so bad in her mind with her first, that
she would not so much as look at bottled stout, and
kept to gruel through the month, has agued me, Mrs.
Harris. But ma'am,' I says to her, 'talk not of Margate,
for if I do go anywheres, it is elsewheres and not
there.' 'Sairey,' says Mrs. Harris, solemn, 'whence
this mystery? If I have ever deceived the hardest-working,
soberest, and best of women, which her name
is well beknown is S. Gamp Midwife Kingsgate Street
High Holborn, mention it. If not,' says Mrs. Harris,
with the tears a standing in her eyes, 'reweal your intentions.'
'Yes, Mrs. Harris,' I says, 'I will. Well
I knows you Mrs. Harris; well you knows me; well we
both knows wot the characters of one another is. Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_377" id="Page_2_377">[377]</a></span>
Harris then,' I says, 'I <i>have</i> heerd as there <i>is</i> a expedition
going down to Manjestir and Liverspool, a play-acting.
If I goes anywheres for change, it is along
with that.' Mrs. Harris clasps her hands, and drops
into a chair, as if her time was come&mdash;which I know'd
it couldn't be, by rights, for six weeks odd. 'And
have I lived to hear,' she says, 'of Sairey Gamp, as
always kept hersef respectable, in company with play-actors!'
'Mrs. Harris,' I says to her, 'be not alarmed&mdash;not
reg'lar play-actors&mdash;hammertoors.' 'Thank
Evans!' says Mrs. Harris, and bustiges into a flood of
tears.</p>

<p>"When the sweet creetur had compoged hersef
(which a sip of brandy and water warm, and sugared
pleasant, with a little nutmeg did it), I proceeds in
these words. 'Mrs. Harris, I am told as these hammertoors
are litter'ry and artistickle.' 'Sairey,' says
that best of wimmin, with a shiver and a slight relasp,
'go on, it might be worse.' 'I likewise hears,' I says
to her, 'that they're agoin play-acting, for the benefit
of two litter'ry men; one as has had his wrongs a long
time ago, and has got his rights at last, and one as has
made a many people merry in his time, but is very dull
and sick and lonely his own sef, indeed.' 'Sairey,'
says Mrs. Harris, 'you're an Inglish woman, and that's
no business of you'rn.'</p>

<p>"'No, Mrs. Harris,' I says, 'that's very true; I
hope I knows my dooty and my country. But,' I says,
'I am informed as there is Ladies in this party, and
that half a dozen of 'em, if not more, is in various
stages of a interesting state. Mrs. Harris, you and me
well knows what Ingeins often does. If I accompanies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_378" id="Page_2_378">[378]</a></span>
this expedition, unbeknown and second cladge, may I
not combine my calling with change of air, and prove
a service to my feller creeturs?' 'Sairey,' was Mrs.
Harris's reply, 'you was born to be a blessing to your
sex, and bring 'em through it. Good go with you!
But keep your distance till called in, Lord bless you
Mrs. Gamp; for people is known by the company they
keeps, and litterary and artistickle society might be the
ruin of you before you was aware, with your best customers,
both sick and monthly, if they took a pride in
themselves.'</p>


<div class='center'><br />"II. MRS. GAMP IS DESCRIPTIVE.</div>

<p>"The number of the cab had a seven in it I think,
and a ought I know&mdash;and if this should meet his eye
(which it was a black 'un, new done, that he saw with;
the other was tied up), I give him warning that he'd
better take that umbereller and patten to the Hackney-coach
Office before he repents it. He was a young man
in a weskit with sleeves to it and strings behind, and
needn't flatter himsef with a suppogition of escape, as
I gave this description of him to the Police the moment
I found he had drove off with my property; and if he
thinks there an't laws enough he's much mistook&mdash;I
tell him that:</p>

<p>"I do assure you, Mrs. Harris, when I stood in the
railways office that morning with my bundle on my
arm and one patten in my hand, you might have
knocked me down with a feather, far less porkmangers
which was a lumping against me, continual and sewere
all round. I was drove about like a brute animal and
almost worritted into fits, when a gentleman with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_379" id="Page_2_379">[379]</a></span>
large shirt-collar and a hook nose, and a eye like one
of Mr. Sweedlepipes's hawks, and long locks of hair,
and wiskers that I wouldn't have no lady as I was engaged
to meet suddenly a turning round a corner, for
any sum of money you could offer me, says, laughing,
'Halloa, Mrs. Gamp, what are <i>you</i> up to!' I didn't
know him from a man (except by his clothes); but I
says faintly, 'If you're a Christian man, show me where
to get a second-cladge ticket for Manjester, and have
me put in a carriage, or I shall drop!' Which he
kindly did, in a cheerful kind of a way, skipping about
in the strangest manner as ever I see, making all kinds
of actions, and looking and vinking at me from under
the brim of his hat (which was a good deal turned up),
to that extent, that I should have thought he meant
something but for being so flurried as not to have no
thoughts at all until I was put in a carriage along with
a individgle&mdash;the politest as ever I see&mdash;in a shepherd's
plaid suit with a long gold watch-guard hanging round
his neck, and his hand a trembling through nervousness
worse than a aspian leaf.</p>

<p>"'I'm wery appy, ma'am,' he says&mdash;the politest vice
as ever I heerd!&mdash;'to go down with a lady belonging
to our party.'</p>

<p>"'Our party, sir!' I says.</p>

<p>"'Yes, m'am,' he says, 'I'm Mr. Wilson. I'm
going down with the wigs.'</p>

<p>"Mrs. Harris, wen he said he was agoing down with
the wigs, such was my state of confugion and worrit
that I thought he must be connected with the Government
in some ways or another, but directly moment he
explains himsef, for he says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_380" id="Page_2_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>"'There's not a theatre in London worth mentioning
that I don't attend punctually. There's five-and-twenty
wigs in these boxes, ma'am,' he says, a pinting
towards a heap of luggage, 'as was worn at the Queen's
Fancy Ball. There's a black wig, ma'am,' he says, 'as
was worn by Garrick; there's a red one, ma'am,' he
says, 'as was worn by Kean; there's a brown one,
ma'am,' he says, 'as was worn by Kemble; there's a
yellow one, ma'am,' he says, 'as was made for Cooke;
there's a grey one, ma'am,' he says, 'as I measured
Mr. Young for, mysef; and there's a white one, ma'am,
that Mr. Macready went mad in. There's a flaxen one
as was got up express for Jenny Lind the night she
came out at the Italian Opera. It was very much applauded
was that wig, ma'am, through the evening. It
had a great reception. The audience broke out, the
moment they see it.'</p>

<p>"'Are you in Mr. Sweedlepipes's line, sir?' I says.</p>

<p>"'Which is that, ma'am?' he says&mdash;the softest and
genteelest vice I ever heerd, I do declare, Mrs. Harris!</p>

<p>"'Hair-dressing,' I says.</p>

<p>"'Yes, ma'am,' he replies, 'I have that honour. Do
you see this, ma'am?' he says, holding up his right hand.</p>

<p>"'I never see such a trembling,' I says to him.
And I never did!</p>

<p>"'All along of Her Majesty's Costume Ball, ma'am,'
he says. 'The excitement did it. Two hundred and
fifty-seven ladies of the first rank and fashion had their
heads got up on that occasion by this hand, and my
t'other one. I was at it eight-and-forty hours on my
feet, ma'am, without rest. It was a Powder ball,
ma'am. We have a Powder piece at Liverpool. Have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_381" id="Page_2_381">[381]</a></span>
I not the pleasure,' he says, looking at me curious, 'of
addressing Mrs. Gamp?'</p>

<p>"'Gamp I am, sir,' I replies. 'Both by name and
natur.'</p>

<p>"'Would you like to see your beeograffer's moustache
and wiskers, ma'am?' he says. 'I've got 'em
in this box.'</p>

<p>"'Drat my beeograffer, sir,' I says, 'he has given
me no region to wish to know anythink about him.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, Missus Gamp, I ask your parden'&mdash;I never
see such a polite man, Mrs. Harris! 'P'raps,' he
says, 'if you're not of the party, you don't know who
it was that assisted you into this carriage!'</p>

<p>"'No, Sir,' I says, 'I don't, indeed.'</p>

<p>"'Why, ma'am,' he says, a wisperin', 'that was
George, ma'am.'</p>

<p>"'What George, sir? I don't know no George,'
says I.</p>

<p>"'The great George, ma'am,' says he. 'The
Crookshanks.'</p>

<p>"If you'll believe me, Mrs. Harris, I turns my head,
and see the wery man a making picturs of me on his
thumb nail, at the winder! while another of 'em&mdash;a
tall, slim, melancolly gent, with dark hair and a bage
vice&mdash;looks over his shoulder, with his head o' one side
as if he understood the subject, and cooly says, '<i>I</i>'ve
draw'd her several times&mdash;in Punch,' he says too!
The owdacious wretch!</p>

<p>"'Which I never touches, Mr. Wilson,' I remarks
out loud&mdash;I couldn't have helped it, Mrs. Harris, if
you had took my life for it!&mdash;'which I never touches,
Mr. Wilson, on account of the lemon!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_382" id="Page_2_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Hush!' says Mr. Wilson. 'There he is!'</p>

<p>"I only see a fat gentleman with curly black hair
and a merry face, a standing on the platform rubbing
his two hands over one another, as if he was washing
of 'em, and shaking his head and shoulders wery much;
and I was a wondering wot Mr. Wilson meant, wen
he says, 'There's Dougladge, Mrs. Gamp!' he says.
'There's him as wrote the life of Mrs. Caudle!'</p>

<p>"Mrs. Harris, wen I see that little willain bodily
before me, it give me such a turn that I was all in a
tremble. If I hadn't lost my umbereller in the cab, I
must have done him a injury with it! Oh the bragian
little traitor! right among the ladies, Mrs. Harris;
looking his wickedest and deceitfullest of eyes while he
was a talking to 'em; laughing at his own jokes as loud
as you please; holding his hat in one hand to cool his-sef,
and tossing back his iron-grey mop of a head of
hair with the other, as if it was so much shavings&mdash;there,
Mrs. Harris, I see him, getting encouragement
from the pretty delooded creeturs, which never know'd
that sweet saint, Mrs. C, as I did, and being treated
with as much confidence as if he'd never wiolated none
of the domestic ties, and never showed up nothing!
Oh the aggrawation of that Dougladge! Mrs. Harris,
if I hadn't apologiged to Mr. Wilson, and put a little
bottle to my lips which was in my pocket for the journey,
and which it is very rare indeed I have about me,
I could not have abared the sight of him&mdash;there, Mrs.
Harris! I could not!&mdash;I must have tore him, or have
give way and fainted.</p>

<p>"While the bell was a ringing, and the luggage of
the hammertoors in great confugion&mdash;all a litter'ry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_383" id="Page_2_383">[383]</a></span>
indeed&mdash;was handled up, Mr. Wilson demeens his-sef
politer than ever. 'That,' he says, 'Mrs. Gamp,' a
pinting to a officer-looking gentleman, that a lady with
a little basket was a taking care on, 'is another of our
party. He's a author too&mdash;continivally going up the
walley of the Muses, Mrs. Gamp. There,' he says,
alluding to a fine looking, portly gentleman, with a
face like a amiable full moon, and a short mild gent,
with a pleasant smile, 'is two more of our artists,
Mrs G, well beknowed at the Royal Academy, as sure
as stones is stones, and eggs is eggs. This resolute
gent,' he says, 'a coming along here as is aperrently
going to take the railways by storm&mdash;him with the
tight legs, and his weskit very much buttoned, and
his mouth very much shut, and his coat a flying open,
and his heels a giving it to the platform, is a cricket
and beeograffer, and our principal tragegian.' 'But
who,' says I, when the bell had left off, and the train
had begun to move, 'who, Mr. Wilson, is the wild
gent in the prespiration, that's been a tearing up and
down all this time with a great box of papers under
his arm, a talking to everybody wery indistinct, and
exciting of himself dreadful?' 'Why?' says Mr. Wilson,
with a smile. 'Because, sir,' I says, 'he's being
left behind.' 'Good God!' cries Mr. Wilson, turning
pale and putting out his head, 'it's <i>your</i> beeograffer&mdash;the
Manager&mdash;and he has got the money, Mrs. Gamp!'
Hous'ever, some one chucked him into the train and
we went off. At the first shreek of the whistle, Mrs.
Harris, I turned white, for I had took notice of some
of them dear creeturs as was the cause of my being
in company, and I know'd the danger that&mdash;but Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_384" id="Page_2_384">[384]</a></span>
Wilson, which is a married man, puts his hand on
mine, and says, 'Mrs. Gamp, calm yourself; it's only
the Ingein.'"</p></div>

<p>Of those of the party with whom these humorous
liberties were taken there are only two now living to
complain of their friendly caricaturist, and Mr. Cruikshank
will perhaps join me in a frank forgiveness not
the less heartily for the kind words about himself that
reached me from Broadstairs not many days after Mrs.
Gamp. "At Canterbury yesterday" (2nd of September)
"I bought George Cruikshank's <i>Bottle</i>. I think
it very powerful indeed: the two last plates most admirable,
except that the boy and girl in the very last are
too young, and the girl more like a circus-phenomenon
than that no-phenomenon she is intended to represent.
I question, however, whether anybody else living could
have done it so well. There is a woman in the last
plate but one, garrulous about the murder, with a child
in her arms, that is as good as Hogarth. Also, the
man who is stooping down, looking at the body. The
philosophy of the thing, as a great lesson, I think all
wrong; because to be striking, and original too, the
drinking should have begun in sorrow, or poverty, or
ignorance&mdash;the three things in which, in its awful
aspect, it <i>does</i> begin. The design would then have
been a double-handed sword&mdash;but too 'radical' for
good old George, I suppose."</p>

<p>The same letter made mention of other matters of
interest. His accounts for the first half-year of <i>Dombey</i>
were so much in excess of what had been expected from
the new publishing arrangements, that from this date
all embarrassments connected with money were brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_385" id="Page_2_385">[385]</a></span>
to a close. His future profits varied of course with his
varying sales, but there was always enough, and savings
were now to begin. "The profits of the half-year are
brilliant. Deducting the hundred pounds a month paid
six times, I have still to receive two thousand two hundred
and twenty pounds, which I think is tidy. Don't
you?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Stone is still here, and I lamed his foot by
walking him seventeen miles the day before yesterday;
but otherwise he flourisheth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why don't you bring
down a carpet-bag-full of books, and take possession of
the drawing-room all the morning? My opinion is that
Goldsmith would die more easy by the seaside. Charley
and Walley have been taken to school this morning in
high spirits, and at London Bridge will be folded in
the arms of Blimber. The Government is about to
issue a Sanitary commission, and Lord John, I am right
well pleased to say, has appointed Henry Austin secretary."
Mr. Austin, who afterwards held the same office
under the Sanitary act, had married his youngest sister
Letitia; and of his two youngest brothers I may add
that Alfred, also a civil-engineer, became one of the
sanitary inspectors, and that Augustus was now placed
in a city employment by Mr. Thomas Chapman, which
after a little time he surrendered, and then found his
way to America.</p>

<p>The next Broadstairs letter (5th of September) resumed
the subject of Goldsmith, whose life I was then
bringing nearly to completion. "Supposing your <i>Goldsmith</i>
made a general sensation, what should you think of
doing a cheap edition of his works? I have an idea that
we might do some things of that sort with considerable
effect. There is really no edition of the great British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_386" id="Page_2_386">[386]</a></span>
novelists in a handy nice form, and would it not be a
likely move to do it with some attractive feature that
could not be given to it by the Teggs and such people?
Supposing one wrote an essay on Fielding for instance,
and another on Smollett, and another on Sterne, recalling
how one read them as a child (no one read them
younger than I, I think;) and how one gradually grew
up into a different knowledge of them, and so forth&mdash;would
it not be interesting to many people? I should
like to know if you descry anything in this. It is one
of the dim notions fluctuating within me.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
profits, brave indeed, are four hundred pounds more
than the utmost I expected.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The same yearnings
have been mine, in reference to the Praslin business.
It is pretty clear to me, for one thing, that the Duchess
was one of the most uncomfortable women in the world,
and that it would have been hard work for anybody to
have got on with her. It is strange to see a bloody
reflection of our friends Eug&egrave;ne Sue and Dumas in the
whole melodrama. Don't you think so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. remembering
what we often said of the canker at the root of
all that Paris life? I dreamed of you, in a wild manner,
all last night.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A sea fog here, which prevents
one's seeing the low-water mark. A circus on the cliff
to the right, and of course I have a box to-night! Deep
slowness in the inimitable's brain. A shipwreck on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_387" id="Page_2_387">[387]</a></span>
the Goodwin sands last Sunday, which <span class="smcap">Wally</span>, with a
hawk's eye, <span class="smcap">saw go down</span>: for which assertion, subsequently
confirmed and proved, he was horribly maltreated
at the time."</p>

<p>Devonshire-terrace meanwhile had been left by his
tenant; and coming up joyfully himself to take possession,
he brought for completion in his old home an
important chapter of <i>Dombey</i>. On the way he lost his
portmanteau, but "Thank God! the MS. of the chapter
wasn't in it. Whenever I travel, and have anything
of that valuable article, I always carry it in my pocket."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
He had begun at this time to find difficulties in writing
at Broadstairs, of which he told me on his return.
"Vagrant music is getting to that height here, and is
so impossible to be escaped from, that I fear Broadstairs
and I must part company in time to come. Unless
it pours of rain, I cannot write half-an-hour without the
most excruciating organs, fiddles, bells, or glee-singers.
There is a violin of the most torturing kind under the
window now (time, ten in the morning) and an Italian
box of music on the steps&mdash;both in full blast." He
closed with a mention of improvements in the Margate
theatre since his memorable last visit. In the past two
years it had been managed by a son of the great comedian,
Dowton, with whose name it is pleasant to connect
this note. "We went to the manager's benefit on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_388" id="Page_2_388">[388]</a></span>
Wednesday" (10th of September): "<i>As You Like It</i>
really very well done, and a most excellent house. Mr.
Dowton delivered a sensible and modest kind of speech
on the occasion, setting forth his conviction that a
means of instruction and entertainment possessing such
a literature as the stage in England, could not pass
away; and, that what inspired great minds, and delighted
great men, two thousand years ago, and did the
same in Shakespeare's day, must have within itself a
principle of life superior to the whim and fashion of the
hour. And with that, and with cheers, he retired. He
really seems a most respectable man, and he has cleared
out this dust-hole of a theatre into something like
decency."</p>

<p>He was to be in London at the end of the month:
but I had from him meanwhile his preface<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> for his
first completed book in the popular edition (<i>Pickwick</i>
being now issued in that form, with an illustration by
Leslie); and sending me shortly after (12th of Sept.)
the first few slips of the story of the <i>Haunted Man</i>
proposed for his next Christmas book, he told me he
must finish it in less than a month if it was to be done
at all, <i>Dombey</i> having now become very importunate.
This prepared me for his letter of a week's later date.
"Have been at work all day, and am seedy in consequence.
<i>Dombey</i> takes so much time, and requires to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_389" id="Page_2_389">[389]</a></span>
be so carefully done, that I really begin to have serious
doubts whether it is wise to go on with the Christmas
book. Your kind help is invoked. What do you
think? Would there be any distinctly bad effect in
holding this idea over for another twelvemonth? saying
nothing whatever till November; and then announcing
in the <i>Dombey</i> that its occupation of my entire time
prevents the continuance of the Christmas series until
next year, when it is proposed to be renewed. There
might not be anything in that but a possibility of an
extra lift for the little book when it did come&mdash;eh?
On the other hand, I am very loath to lose the money.
And still more so to leave any gap at Christmas firesides
which I ought to fill. In short I am (forgive the
expression) <span class="smcap">blowed</span> if I know what to do. I am a
literary Kitely&mdash;and you ought to sympathize and help.
If I had no <i>Dombey</i>, I could write and finish the story
with the bloom on&mdash;but there's the rub.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Which
unfamiliar quotation reminds me of a Shakspearian
(put an e before the s; I like it much better) speculation
of mine. What do you say to 'take arms against
a sea of troubles' having been originally written 'make
arms,' which is the action of swimming. It would get
rid of a horrible grievance in the figure, and make it
plain and apt. I think of setting up a claim to live in
The House at Stratford, rent-free, on the strength of
this suggestion. You are not to suppose that I am
anything but disconcerted to-day, in the agitation of
my soul concerning Christmas; but I have been brooding,
like Dombey himself, over <i>Dombey</i> these two days,
until I really can't afford to be depressed." To his
Shakespearian suggestion I replied that it would hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_390" id="Page_2_390">[390]</a></span>
give him the claim he thought of setting up, for that
swimming through your troubles would not be "opposing"
them. And upon the other point I had no
doubt of the wisdom of delay. The result was that
the Christmas story was laid aside until the following
year.</p>

<p>The year's closing incidents were his chairmanship
at a meeting of the Leeds Mechanics' Society on the
1st of December, and his opening of the Glasgow Athen&aelig;um
on the 28th; where, to immense assemblages
in both,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> he contrasted the obstinacy and cruelty of
the Power of ignorance with the docility and gentleness
of the Power of knowledge; pointed the use of
popular institutes in supplementing what is learnt first
in life, by the later education for its employments and
equipment for its domesticities and virtues, which the
grown person needs from day to day as much as the
child its reading and writing; and he closed at Glasgow
with allusion to a bazaar set on foot by the ladies
of the city, under patronage of the Queen, for adding
books to its Athen&aelig;um library. "We never tire of
the friendships we form with books," he said, "and
here they will possess the added charm of association<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_391" id="Page_2_391">[391]</a></span>
with their donors. Some neighbouring Glasgow widow
will be mistaken for that remoter one whom Sir Roger
de Coverley could not forget; Sophia's muff will be
seen and loved, by another than Tom Jones, going
down the High-street some winter day; and the grateful
students of a library thus filled will be apt, as to the
fair ones who have helped to people it, to couple them
in their thoughts with Principles of the Population and
Additions to the History of Europe, by an author of
older date than Sheriff Alison." At which no one
laughed so loudly as the Sheriff himself, who had cordially
received Dickens as his guest, and stood with
him on the platform.</p>

<p>On the last day but one of the old year he wrote to
me from Edinburgh. "We came over this afternoon,
leaving Glasgow at one o'clock. Alison lives in style
in a handsome country house out of Glasgow, and is
a capital fellow, with an agreeable wife, nice little
daughter, cheerful niece, all things pleasant in his
household. I went over the prison and lunatic asylum
with him yesterday;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> at the Lord Provost's had gorgeous
state-lunch with the Town Council; and was entertained
at a great dinner-party at night. Unbounded
hospitality and enthoozymoozy the order of the day,
and I have never been more heartily received anywhere,
or enjoyed myself more completely. The great chemist,
Gregory, who spoke at the meeting, returned with us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_392" id="Page_2_392">[392]</a></span>
to Edinburgh to-day, and gave me many new lights on
the road regarding the extraordinary pains Macaulay
seems for years to have taken to make himself disagreeable
and disliked here. No one else, on that side,
would have had the remotest chance of being unseated
at the last election; and, though Gregory voted for
him, I thought he seemed quite as well pleased as anybody
else that he didn't come in.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am sorry to
report the Scott Monument a failure. It is like the spire
of a Gothic church taken off and stuck in the ground."
On the first day of 1848, still in Edinburgh, he wrote
again: "Jeffrey, who is obliged to hold a kind of
morning court in his own study during the holidays,
came up yesterday in great consternation, to tell me
that a person had just been to make and sign a declaration
of bankruptcy; and that on looking at the
signature he saw it was James Sheridan Knowles. He
immediately sent after, and spoke with him; and of
what passed I am eager to talk with you." The talk
will bring back the main subject of this chapter, from
which another kind of strolling has led me away; for
its results were other amateur performances, of which
the object was to benefit Knowles.</p>

<p>This was the year when a committee had been formed
for the purchase and preservation of Shakespeare's house
at Stratford, and the performances in question took the
form of contributions to the endowment of a curatorship
to be held by the author of <i>Virginius</i> and the
<i>Hunchback</i>. The endowment was abandoned upon the
town and council of Stratford finally (and very properly)
taking charge of the house; but the sum realised
was not withdrawn from the object really desired, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_393" id="Page_2_393">[393]</a></span>
one of the finest of dramatists profited yet more largely
by it than Leigh Hunt did by the former enterprise.
It may be proper to remark also, that, like Leigh Hunt,
Knowles received soon after, through Lord John Russell,
the same liberal pension; and that smaller claims to
which attention had been similarly drawn were not
forgotten, Mr. Poole, after much kind help from the
Bounty Fund, being in 1850 placed on the Civil List
for half the amount by the same minister and friend of
letters.</p>

<p>Dickens threw himself into the new scheme with all
his old energy;<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and prefatory mention may be made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_394" id="Page_2_394">[394]</a></span>
of our difficulty in selection of a suitable play to alternate
with our old Ben Jonson. The <i>Alchemist</i> had
been such a favourite with some of us, that, before
finally laying it aside, we went through two or three
rehearsals, in which I recollect thinking Dickens's Sir
Epicure Mammon as good as anything he had done;
and now the same trouble, with the same result, arising
from a vain desire to please everybody, was taken successively
with Beaumont and Fletcher's <i>Beggar's Bush</i>,
and Goldsmith's <i>Good Natured Man</i>, with Jerrold's
characteristic drama of the <i>Rent Day</i>, and Bulwer's
masterly comedy of <i>Money</i>. Choice was at last made
of Shakespeare's <i>Merry Wives</i>, in which Lemon played
Falstaff, I took again the jealous husband as in Jonson's
play, and Dickens was Justice Shallow; to which was
added a farce, <i>Love, Law, and Physick</i>, in which
Dickens took the part he had acted long ago, before his
days of authorship; and, besides the professional actresses
engaged, we had for our Dame Quickly the lady
to whom the world owes incomparably the best <i>Concordance</i>
to Shakespeare that has ever been published,
Mrs. Cowden Clarke. The success was undoubtedly
very great. At Manchester, Liverpool, and Edinburgh
there were single representations; but Birmingham and
Glasgow had each two nights, and two were given at the
Haymarket, on one of which the Queen and Prince
were present. The gross receipts from the nine performances,
before the necessary large deductions for
London and local charges, were two thousand five hundred
and fifty-one pounds and eightpence.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_395" id="Page_2_395">[395]</a></span>
representation was in London on the 15th of April, the
last in Glasgow on the 20th of July, and everywhere
Dickens was the leading figure. In the enjoyment as
in the labour he was first. His animal spirits, unresting
and supreme, were the attraction of rehearsal at
morning, and of the stage at night. At the quiet early
dinner, and the more jovial unrestrained supper, where
all engaged were assembled daily, his was the brightest
face, the lightest step, the pleasantest word. There
seemed to be no rest needed for that wonderful vitality.</p>

<p>My allusion to the last of these splendid strollings in
aid of what we believed to be the interests of men of
letters, shall be as brief as I can make it. Two winters
after the present, at the close of November 1850, in the
great hall of Lord Lytton's old family mansion in
Knebworth-park, there were three private performances
by the original actors in Ben Jonson's <i>Every Man in
His Humour</i>. All the circumstances and surroundings
were very brilliant; some of the gentlemen of the
county played both in the comedy and farces; our
generous host was profuse of all noble encouragement;
and amid the general pleasure and excitement hopes
rose high. Recent experience had shown what the
public interest in this kind of amusement might place
within reach of its providers; and there came to be
discussed the possibility of making permanent such
help as had been afforded to fellow writers, by means
of an endowment that should not be mere charity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_396" id="Page_2_396">[396]</a></span>
but should combine indeed something of both pension-list
and college-lectureship, without the drawbacks of
either. It was not enough considered that schemes for
self-help, to be successful, require from those they are
meant to benefit, not only a general assent to their desirability,
but zealous and active co-operation. Without
discussing now, however, what will have to be stated
hereafter, it suffices to say that the enterprise was set on
foot, and the "Guild of Literature and Art" originated
at Knebworth. A five-act comedy was to be written by
Sir Edward Lytton, and, when a certain sum of money
had been obtained by public representations of it, the
details of the scheme were to be drawn up, and appeal
made to those whom it addressed more especially.
In a very few months everything was ready, except a
farce which Dickens was to have written to follow the
comedy, and which unexpected cares of management
and preparation were held to absolve him from. There
were other reasons. "I have written the first scene,"
he told me (23rd March, 1851), "and it has droll
points in it, more farcical points than you commonly
find in farces,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> really better. Yet I am constantly
striving, for my reputation's sake, to get into it a meaning
that is impossible in a farce; constantly thinking
of it, therefore, against the grain; and constantly impressed
with a conviction that I could never act in it
myself with that wild abandonment which can alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_397" id="Page_2_397">[397]</a></span>
carry a farce off. Wherefore I have confessed to Bulwer
Lytton and asked for absolution." There was
substituted a new farce of Lemon's, to which, however,
Dickens soon contributed so many jokes and so much
Gampish and other fun of his own, that it came to be
in effect a joint piece of authorship; and Gabblewig,
which the manager took to himself, was one of those
personation parts requiring five or six changes of face,
voice, and gait in the course of it, from which, as we
have seen, he derived all the early theatrical ambition
that the elder Mathews had awakened in him. "You
have no idea," he continued, "of the immensity of the
work as the time advances, for the Duke even throws
the whole of the audience on us, or he would get (he
says) into all manner of scrapes." The Duke of Devonshire
had offered his house in Piccadilly for the first
representations, and in his princely way discharged all
the expenses attending them. A moveable theatre was
built and set up in the great drawing-room, and the
library was turned into a green-room.</p>

<p><i>Not so Bad as We Seem</i> was played for the first time
at Devonshire-house on the 27th of May, 1851, before
the Queen and Prince and as large an audience as places
could be found for; <i>Mr. Nightingale's Diary</i> being the
name given to the farce. The success abundantly
realised the expectations formed; and, after many
representations at the Hanover-square Rooms in London,
strolling began in the country, and was continued
at intervals for considerable portions of this and the
following year. From much of it, illness and occupation
disabled me, and substitutes had to be found; but
to this I owe the opportunity now of closing with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_398" id="Page_2_398">[398]</a></span>
characteristic picture of the course of the play, and of
Dickens amid the incidents and accidents to which his
theatrical career exposed him. The company carried
with them, it should be said, the theatre constructed
for Devonshire-house, as well as the admirable scenes
which Stanfield, David Roberts, Thomas Grieve, Telbin,
Absolon, and Louis Haghe had painted as their
generous free-offerings to the comedy; of which the
representations were thus rendered irrespective of theatres
or their managers, and took place in the large
halls or concert-rooms of the various towns and cities.</p>

<p>"The enclosure forgotten in my last" (Dickens
writes from Sunderland on the 29th of August 1852),
"was a little printed announcement which I have had
distributed at the doors wherever we go, knocking <i>Two
o' Clock in the Morning</i> bang out of the bills. Funny as
it used to be, it is become impossible to get anything
out of it after the scream of <i>Mr. Nightingale's Diary</i>.
The comedy is so far improved by the reductions which
your absence and other causes have imposed on us, that
it acts now only two hours and twenty-five minutes, all
waits included, and goes 'like wildfire,' as Mr. Tonson<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
says. We have had prodigious houses, though smaller
rooms (as to their actual size) than I had hoped for.
The Duke was at Derby, and no end of minor radiances.
Into the room at Newcastle (where Lord Carlisle was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_399" id="Page_2_399">[399]</a></span>
by the bye) they squeezed six hundred people, at twelve
and sixpence, into a space reasonably capable of holding
three hundred. Last night, in a hall built like a
theatre, with pit, boxes, and gallery, we had about
twelve hundred&mdash;I dare say more. They began with a
round of applause when Coote's white waistcoat appeared
in the orchestra, and wound up the farce with
three deafening cheers. I never saw such good fellows.
Stanny is their fellow-townsman; was born here; and
they applauded his scene as if it were himself. But
what I suffered from a dreadful anxiety that hung over
me all the time, I can never describe. When we got
here at noon, it appeared that the hall was a perfectly
new one, and had only had the slates put upon the roof
by torchlight over night. Farther, that the proprietors
of some opposition rooms had declared the building to
be unsafe, and that there was a panic in the town about
it; people having had their money back, and being
undecided whether to come or not, and all kinds of
such horrors. I didn't know what to do. The horrible
responsibility of risking an accident of that awful nature
seemed to rest wholly upon me; for I had only to
say we wouldn't act, and there would be no chance of
danger. I was afraid to take Sloman into council lest
the panic should infect our men. I asked W. what he
thought, and he consolingly observed that his digestion
was so bad that death had no terrors for him! I went
and looked at the place; at the rafters, walls, pillars,
and so forth; and fretted myself into a belief that they
really were slight! To crown all, there was an arched
iron roof without any brackets or pillars, on a new
principle! The only comfort I had was in stumbling at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_400" id="Page_2_400">[400]</a></span>
length on the builder, and finding him a plain practical
north-countryman with a foot rule in his pocket. I took
him aside, and asked him should we, or could we, prop
up any weak part of the place: especially the dressing-rooms,
which were under our stage, the weight of which
must be heavy on a new floor, and dripping wet walls.
He told me there wasn't a stronger building in the
world; and that, to allay the apprehension, they had
opened it, on Thursday night, to thousands of the working
people, and induced them to sing, and beat with
their feet, and make every possible trial of the vibration.
Accordingly there was nothing for it but to go
on. I was in such dread, however, lest a false alarm
should spring up among the audience and occasion a
rush, that I kept Catherine and Georgina out of the
front. When the curtain went up and I saw the great
sea of faces rolling up to the roof, I looked here
and looked there, and thought I saw the gallery out
of the perpendicular, and fancied the lights in the
ceiling were not straight. Rounds of applause were
perfect agony to me, I was so afraid of their effect
upon the building. I was ready all night to rush on
in case of an alarm&mdash;a false alarm was my main dread&mdash;and
implore the people for God's sake to sit still.
I had our great farce-bell rung to startle Sir Geoffrey
instead of throwing down a piece of wood, which
might have raised a sudden-apprehension. I had a
palpitation of the heart, if any of our people stumbled
up or down a stair. I am sure I never acted better,
but the anxiety of my mind was so intense, and the
relief at last so great, that I am half-dead to-day, and
have not yet been able to eat or drink anything or to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_401" id="Page_2_401">[401]</a></span>
stir out of my room. I shall never forget it. As to
the short time we had for getting the theatre up; as to
the upsetting, by a runaway pair of horses, of one of
the vans at the Newcastle railway station, <i>with all the
scenery in it, every atom of which was turned over;</i> as
to the fatigue of our carpenters, who have now been
up four nights, and who were lying dead asleep in the
entrances last night; I say nothing, after the other
gigantic nightmare, except that Sloman's splendid
knowledge of his business, and the good temper and
cheerfulness of all the workmen, are capital. I mean
to give them a supper at Liverpool, and address them
in a neat and appropriate speech. We dine at two
to-day (it is now one) and go to Sheffield at four,
arriving there at about ten. I had been as fresh as a
daisy; walked from Nottingham to Derby, and from
Newcastle here; but seem to have had my nerves
crumpled up last night, and have an excruciating headache.
That's all at present. I shall never be able to
bear the smell of new deal and fresh mortar again as
long as I live."</p>

<p>Manchester and Liverpool closed the trip with enormous
success at both places; and Sir Edward Lytton
was present at a public dinner which was given in the
former city, Dickens's brief word about it being written
as he was setting foot in the train that was to bring
him to London. "Bulwer spoke brilliantly at the
Manchester dinner, and his earnestness and determination
about the Guild was most impressive. It carried
everything before it. They are now getting up annual
subscriptions, and will give us a revenue to begin with.
I swear I believe that people to be the greatest in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_402" id="Page_2_402">[402]</a></span>
world. At Liverpool I had a Round Robin on the
stage after the play was over, a place being left for
your signature, and as I am going to have it framed,
I'll tell Green to send it to Lincoln's-inn-fields. You
have no idea how good Tenniel, Topham, and Collins
have been in what they had to do."</p>

<p>These names, distinguished in art and letters, represent
additions to the company who had joined the
enterprise; and the last of them, Mr. Wilkie Collins,
became, for all the rest of the life of Dickens, one of
his dearest and most valued friends.</p>

in 1848 of the story of <i>The Haunted Man</i>, and to the
establishment in 1850 of the Periodical which had been
in his thoughts for half a dozen years before, and has
had foreshadowings nearly as frequent in my pages.</p>

<p>Among the incidents of 1848 before the holiday
season came, were the dethronement of Louis Philippe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_404" id="Page_2_404">[404]</a></span>
and birth of the second French republic: on which I
ventured to predict that a Gore-house friend of ours,
and <i>his</i> friend, would in three days be on the scene of
action. The three days passed, and I had this letter.
"Mardi, F&eacute;vrier 29, 1848. <span class="smcap">Mon Cher</span>. Vous &ecirc;tes

d&eacute;vou&eacute;, <span class="smcap">Citoyen Charles Dickens</span>." I proved to
be not quite so wrong, nevertheless, as my friend supposed.</p>

<p>Somewhat earlier than usual this summer, on the
close of the Shakespeare-house performances, he tried
Broadstairs once more, having no important writing in
hand: but in the brief interval before leaving he saw
a thing of celebrity in those days, the Chinese Junk;
and I had all the details in so good a description that
I could not resist the temptation of using some parts
of it at the time. "Drive down to the Blackwall railway,"
he wrote to me, "and for a matter of eighteen-pence
you are at the Chinese Empire in no time. In
half a score of minutes, the tiles and chimney-pots,
backs of squalid houses, frowsy pieces of waste ground,
narrow courts and streets, swamps, ditches, masts of
ships, gardens of dockweed, and unwholesome little
bowers of scarlet beans, whirl away in a flying dream,
and nothing is left but China. How the flowery region
ever came into this latitude and longitude is the first
thing one asks; and it is not certainly the least of the
marvel. As Aladdin's palace was transported hither
and thither by the rubbing of a lamp, so the crew of
Chinamen aboard the Keying devoutly believed that
their good ship would turn up, quite safe, at the desired
port, if they only tied red rags enough upon the
mast, rudder, and cable. Somehow they did not succeed.
Perhaps they ran short of rag; at any rate they
hadn't enough on board to keep them above water;
and to the bottom they would undoubtedly have gone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_406" id="Page_2_406">[406]</a></span>
but for the skill and coolness of a dozen English sailors,
who brought them over the ocean in safety. Well, if
there be any one thing in the world that this extraordinary
craft is not at all like, that thing is a ship of
any kind. So narrow, so long, so grotesque; so low
in the middle, so high at each end, like a China pen-tray;
with no rigging, with nowhere to go to aloft;
with mats for sails, great warped cigars for masts, gaudy
dragons and sea-monsters disporting themselves from
stem to stern, and <i>on</i> the stern a gigantic cock of impossible
aspect, defying the world (as well he may) to
produce his equal,&mdash;it would look more at home at the
top of a public building, or at the top of a mountain,
or in an avenue of trees, or down in a mine, than afloat
on the water. As for the Chinese lounging on the
deck, the most extravagant imagination would never
dare to suppose them to be mariners. Imagine a ship's
crew, without a profile among them, in gauze pinafores
and plaited hair; wearing stiff clogs a quarter
of a foot thick in the sole; and lying at night in little
scented boxes, like backgammon men or chess-pieces,
or mother-of-pearl counters! But by Jove! even this
is nothing to your surprise when you go down into the
cabin. There you get into a torture of perplexity.
As, what became of all those lanterns hanging to the
roof when the Junk was out at sea? Whether they
dangled there, banging and beating against each other,
like so many jesters' baubles? Whether the idol Chin
Tee, of the eighteen arms, enshrined in a celestial
Punch's Show, in the place of honour, ever tumbled
out in heavy weather? Whether the incense and the
joss-stick still burnt before her, with a faint perfume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_407" id="Page_2_407">[407]</a></span>
and a little thread of smoke, while the mighty waves
were roaring all around? Whether that preposterous
tissue-paper umbrella in the corner was always spread,
as being a convenient maritime instrument for walking
about the decks with in a storm? Whether all the
cool and shiny little chairs and tables were continually
sliding about and bruising each other, and if not why
not? Whether anybody on the voyage ever read those
two books printed in characters like bird-cages and
fly-traps? Whether the Mandarin passenger, He Sing,
who had never been ten miles from home in his life
before, lying sick on a bamboo couch in a private china
closet of his own (where he is now perpetually writing
autographs for inquisitive barbarians), ever began to
doubt the potency of the Goddess of the Sea, whose
counterfeit presentment, like a flowery monthly nurse,
occupies the sailors' joss-house in the second gallery?
Whether it is possible that the said Mandarin, or the
artist of the ship, Sam Sing, Esquire, R.A. of Canton,
<i>can</i> ever go ashore without a walking-staff of cinnamon,
agreeably to the usage of their likenesses in
British tea-shops? Above all, whether the hoarse old
ocean could ever have been seriously in earnest with
this floating toy-shop; or had merely played with it in
lightness of spirit&mdash;roughly, but meaning no harm&mdash;as
the bull did with another kind of china-shop on St.
Patrick's day in the morning."</p>

<p>The reply made on this brought back comment and
sequel not less amusing. "Yes, there can be no question
that this is Finality in perfection; and it is a great
advantage to have the doctrine so beautifully worked
out, and shut up in a corner of a dock near a fashionable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_408" id="Page_2_408">[408]</a></span>
white-bait house for the edification of man.
Thousands of years have passed away since the first
junk was built on this model, and the last junk ever
launched was no better for that waste and desert of
time. The mimic eye painted on their prows to assist
them in finding their way, has opened as wide and seen
as far as any actual organ of sight in all the interval
through the whole immense extent of that strange
country. It has been set in the flowery head to as
little purpose for thousands of years. With all their
patient and ingenious but never advancing art, and
with all their rich and diligent agricultural cultivation,
not a new twist or curve has been given to a ball of
ivory, and not a blade of experience has been grown.
There is a genuine finality in that; and when one
comes from behind the wooden screen that encloses
the curious sight, to look again upon the river and the
mighty signs on its banks of life, enterprise, and progress,
the question that comes nearest is beyond doubt
a home one. Whether <i>we</i> ever by any chance, in
storms, trust to red flags; or burn joss-sticks before
idols; or grope our way by the help of conventional
eyes that have no sight in them; or sacrifice substantial
facts for absurd forms? The ignorant crew of the
Keying refused to enter on the ships' books, until 'a
considerable amount of silvered-paper, tin-foil, and
joss-stick' had been laid in by the owners for the purposes
of their worship. And I wonder whether <i>our</i>
seamen, let alone our bishops and deacons, ever stand
out upon points of silvered-paper and tin-foil and joss-sticks.
To be sure Christianity is not Chin-Teeism,
and that I suppose is why we never lose sight of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_409" id="Page_2_409">[409]</a></span>
end in contemptible and insignificant quarrels about
the means. There is enough matter for reflection
aboard the Keying at any rate to last one's voyage
home to England again."</p>

<p>Other letters of the summer from Broadstairs will
complete what he wrote from the same place last year
on Mr. Cruikshank's efforts in the cause of temperance,
and will enable me to say, what I know he wished to
be remembered in his story, that there was no subject
on which through his whole life he felt more strongly
than this. No man advocated temperance, even as
far as possible its legislative enforcement, with greater
earnestness; but he made important reservations. Not
thinking drunkenness to be a vice inborn, or incident
to the poor more than to other people, he never would
agree that the existence of a gin-shop was the alpha and
omega of it. Believing it to be, <i>the</i> "national horror,"
he also believed that many operative causes had to do
with having made it so; and his objection to the temperance
agitation was that these were left out of account
altogether. He thought the gin-shop not fairly to be
rendered the exclusive object of attack, until, in connection
with the classes who mostly made it their resort,
the temptations that led to it, physical and moral,
should have been more bravely dealt with. Among the
former he counted foul smells, disgusting habitations,
bad workshops and workshop-customs, scarcity of light,
air, and water, in short the absence of all easy means
of decency and health; and among the latter, the mental
weariness and languor so induced, the desire of
wholesome relaxation, the craving for <i>some</i> stimulus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_410" id="Page_2_410">[410]</a></span>
and excitement, not less needful than the sun itself to
lives so passed, and last, and inclusive of all the rest,
ignorance, and the want of rational mental training,
generally applied. This was consistently Dickens's
"platform" throughout the years he was known to me;
and holding it to be within the reach as well as the
scope of legislation, which even our political magnates
have been discovering lately, he thought intemperance
to be but the one result that, out of all those arising
from the absence of legislation, was the most wretched.
For him, drunkenness had a teeming and reproachful
history anterior to the drunken stage; and he thought
it the first duty of the moralist bent upon annihilating
the gin-shop, to "strike deep and spare not" at those
previous remediable evils. Certainly this was not the
way of Mr. Cruikshank, any more than it is that of the
many excellent people who take part in temperance
agitations. His former tale of the <i>Bottle</i>, as told by
his admirable pencil, was that of a decent working
man, father of a boy and a girl, living in comfort and
good esteem until near the middle age, when, happening
unluckily to have a goose for dinner one day in the
bosom of his thriving family, he jocularly sends out for
a bottle of gin, persuades his wife, until then a picture
of neatness and good housewifery, to take a little drop
after the stuffing, and the whole family from that moment
drink themselves to destruction. The sequel, of
which Dickens now wrote to me, traced the lives of
the boy and girl after the wretched deaths of their
drunken parents, through gin-shop, beer-shop, and dancing-rooms,
up to their trial for robbery, when the boy
is convicted, dying aboard the hulks; and the girl,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_411" id="Page_2_411">[411]</a></span>
desolate and mad after her acquittal, flings herself from
London-bridge into the night-darkened river.</p>

<p>"I think," said Dickens, "the power of that closing
scene quite extraordinary. It haunts the remembrance
like an awful reality. It is full of passion and terror,
and I doubt very much whether any hand but his could
so have rendered it. There are other fine things too.
The death-bed scene on board the hulks; the convict
who is composing the face, and the other who is drawing
the screen round the bed's head; seem to me masterpieces
worthy of the greatest painter. The reality
of the place, and the fidelity with which every minute
object illustrative of it is presented, are surprising. I
think myself no bad judge of this feature, and it is
remarkable throughout. In the trial scene at the Old
Bailey, the eye may wander round the Court, and observe
everything that is a part of the place. The very
light and atmosphere are faithfully reproduced. So, in
the gin-shop and the beer-shop. An inferior hand
would indicate a fragment of the fact, and slur it over;
but here every shred is honestly made out. The man
behind the bar in the gin-shop, is as real as the convicts
at the hulks, or the barristers round the table in the
Old Bailey. I found it quite curious, as I closed the
book, to recall the number of faces I had seen of individual
identity, and to think what a chance they have
of living, as the Spanish friar said to Wilkie, when the
living have passed away. But it only makes more exasperating
to me the obstinate one-sidedness of the
thing. When a man shows so forcibly the side of the
medal on which the people in their faults and crimes
are stamped, he is the more bound to help us to a glance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_412" id="Page_2_412">[412]</a></span>
at that other side on which the faults and vices of the
governments placed over the people are not less gravely
impressed."</p>

<p>This led to some remark on Hogarth's method in
such matters, and I am glad to be able to preserve this
fine criticism of that great Englishman, by a writer who
closely resembled him in genius; as another generation
will be probably more apt than our own to discover.
"Hogarth avoided the Drunkard's Progress, I conceive,
precisely because the causes of drunkenness among the
poor were so numerous and widely spread, and lurked
so sorrowfully deep and far down in all human misery,
neglect, and despair, that even <i>his</i> pencil could not
bring them fairly and justly into the light. It was
never his plan to be content with only showing the
effect. In the death of the miser-father, his shoe new-soled
with the binding of his bible, before the young
Rake begins his career; in the worldly father, listless
daughter, impoverished young lord, and crafty lawyer,
of the first plate of Marriage-&agrave;-la mode; in the detestable
advances through the stages of Cruelty; and in
the progress downward of Thomas Idle; you see the
effects indeed, but also the causes. He was never disposed
to spare the kind of drunkenness that was of more
'respectable' engenderment, as one sees in his midnight
modern conversation, the election plates, and crowds
of stupid aldermen and other guzzlers. But after one
immortal journey down Gin-lane, he turned away in
pity and sorrow&mdash;perhaps in hope of better things, one
day, from better laws and schools and poor men's homes&mdash;and
went back no more. The scene of Gin-lane,
you know, is that just cleared away for the extension<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_413" id="Page_2_413">[413]</a></span>
of Oxford-street, which we were looking at the other
day; and I think it a remarkable trait of Hogarth's
picture, that while it exhibits drunkenness in the most
appalling forms, it also forces on attention a most neglected
wretched neighbourhood, and an unwholesome,
indecent, abject condition of life that might be put as
frontispiece to our sanitary report of a hundred years
later date. I have always myself thought the purpose
of this fine piece to be not adequately stated even by
<span class="smcap">Charles Lamb</span>. 'The very houses seem absolutely
reeling' it is true; but beside that wonderful picture
of what follows intoxication, we have indication quite
as powerful of what leads to it among the neglected
classes. There is no evidence that any of the actors
in the dreary scene have ever been much better than
we see them there. The best are pawning the commonest
necessaries, and tools of their trades; and the
worst are homeless vagrants who give us no clue to
their having been otherwise in bygone days. All are
living and dying miserably. Nobody is interfering for
prevention or for cure, in the generation going out
before us, or the generation coming in. The beadle
is the only sober man in the composition except the
pawnbroker, and he is mightily indifferent to the orphan-child
crying beside its parent's coffin. The little charity-girls
are not so well taught or looked after, but that
they can take to dram-drinking already. The church
indeed is very prominent and handsome; but as, quite
passive in the picture, it coldly surveys these things in
progress under shadow of its tower, I cannot but bethink
me that it was not until this year of grace 1848
that a Bishop of London first came out respecting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_414" id="Page_2_414">[414]</a></span>
something wrong in poor men's social accommodations,
and I am confirmed in my suspicion that Hogarth
had many meanings which have not grown
obsolete in a century."</p>

<p>Another art-criticism by Dickens should be added.
Upon a separate publication by Leech of some drawings
on stone called the Rising Generation, from designs
done for Mr. Punch's gallery, he wrote at my
request a little essay of which a few sentences will find
appropriate place with his letter on the other great caricaturist
of his time. I use that word, as he did, only
for want of a better. Dickens was of opinion that, in
this particular line of illustration, while he conceded
all his fame to the elder and stronger contemporary,
Mr. Leech was the very first Englishman who had made
Beauty a part of his art; and he held, that, by striking
out this course, and setting the successful example of
introducing always into his most whimsical pieces some
beautiful faces or agreeable forms, he had done more
than any other man of his generation to refine a branch
of art to which the facilities of steam-printing and
wood-engraving were giving almost unrivalled diffusion
and popularity. His opinion of Leech in a word was
that he turned caricature into character; and would
leave behind him not a little of the history of his time
and its follies, sketched with inimitable grace.</p>

<p>"If we turn back to a collection of the works of
Rowlandson or Gilray, we shall find, in spite of the
great humour displayed in many of them, that they are
rendered wearisome and unpleasant by a vast amount
of personal ugliness. Now, besides that it is a poor
device to represent what is satirized as being necessarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_415" id="Page_2_415">[415]</a></span>
ugly, which is but the resource of an angry child or a
jealous woman, it serves no purpose but to produce a
disagreeable result. There is no reason why the farmer's
daughter in the old caricature who is squalling at the
harpsichord (to the intense delight, by the bye, of
her worthy father, whom it is her duty to please)
should be squab and hideous. The satire on the
manner of her education, if there be any in the thing
at all, would be just as good, if she were pretty.
Mr. Leech would have made her so. The average
of farmers' daughters in England are not impossible
lumps of fat. One is quite as likely to find a pretty
girl in a farm-house, as to find an ugly one; and
we think, with Mr. Leech, that the business of this
Style of art is with the pretty one. She is not only a
pleasanter object, but we have more interest in her.
We care more about what does become her, and does
not become her. Mr. Leech represented the other day
certain delicate creatures with bewitching countenances
encased in several varieties of that amazing garment,
the ladies' paletot. Formerly those fair creatures would
have been made as ugly and ungainly as possible, and
then the point would have been lost. The spectator,
with a laugh at the absurdity of the whole group, would
not have cared how such uncouth creatures disguised
themselves, or how ridiculous they became.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But
to represent female beauty as Mr. Leech represents it,
an artist must have, a most delicate perception of it;
and the gift of being able to realise it to us with two or
three slight, sure touches of his pencil. This power
Mr. Leech possesses, in an extraordinary degree.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
For this reason, we enter our protest against those of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_416" id="Page_2_416">[416]</a></span>
the Rising Generation who are precociously in love
being made the subject of merriment by a pitiless and
unsympathizing world. We never saw a boy more distinctly
in the right than the young gentleman kneeling
on the chair to beg a lock of hair from his pretty
cousin, to take back to school. Madness is in her
apron, and Virgil dog's-eared and defaced is in her
ringlets. Doubts may suggest themselves of the perfect
disinterestedness of the other young gentleman contemplating
the fair girl at the piano&mdash;doubts engendered
by his worldly allusion to 'tin'; though even
that may have arisen in his modest consciousness of his
own inability to support an establishment&mdash;but that
he should be 'deucedly inclined to go and cut that
fellow out,' appears to us one of the most natural emotions
of the human breast. The young gentleman with
the dishevelled hair and clasped hands who loves the
transcendant beauty with the bouquet, and can't be
happy without her, is to us a withering and desolate
spectacle. Who <i>could</i> be happy without her?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
growing youths are not less happily observed and
agreeably depicted than the grown women. The languid
little creature who 'hasn't danced since he was
quite a boy,' is perfect; and the eagerness of the small
dancer whom he declines to receive for a partner at the
hands of the glorious old lady of the house (the little
feet quite ready for the first position, the whole heart
projected into the quadrille, and the glance peeping
timidly at the desired one out of a flutter of hope and
doubt) is quite delightful to look at. The intellectual
juvenile who awakens the tremendous wrath of a Norma
of private life by considering woman an inferior animal,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_417" id="Page_2_417">[417]</a></span>
is lecturing at the present moment, we understand, on
the Concrete in connexion with the Will. The legs of
the young philosopher who considers Shakespeare an
over-rated man, were seen by us dangling over the
side of an omnibus last Tuesday. We have no acquaintance
with the scowling young gentleman who
is clear that 'if his Governor don't like the way he
goes on in, why he must have chambers and so much
a week;' but if he is not by this time in Van Diemen's
land, he will certainly go to it through Newgate.
We should exceedingly dislike to have personal
property in a strong box, to live in the suburb of
Camberwell, and to be in the relation of bachelor-uncle
to that youth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In all his designs, whatever
Mr. Leech desires to do, he does. His drawing seems
to us charming; and the expression indicated, though
by the simplest means, is exactly the natural expression,
and is recognised as such immediately. Some
forms of our existing life will never have a better
chronicler. His wit is good-natured, and always the
wit of a gentleman. He has a becoming sense of responsibility
and self-restraint; he delights in agreeable
things; he imparts some pleasant air of his own to
things not pleasant in themselves; he is suggestive and
full of matter; and he is always improving. Into the
tone as well as into the execution of what he does, he
has brought a certain elegance which is altogether new,
without involving any compromise of what is true.
Popular art in England has not had so rich an acquisition."
Dickens's closing allusion was to a remark made
by Mr. Ford in a review of <i>Oliver Twist</i> formerly referred
to. "It is eight or ten years since a writer in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_418" id="Page_2_418">[418]</a></span>
the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, making mention of <span class="smcap">Mr. George
Cruikshank</span>, commented on the absurdity of excluding
such a man from the Royal Academy, because his works
were not produced in certain materials, and did not
occupy a certain space in its annual shows. Will no
Associates be found upon its books one of these days,
the labours of whose oil and brushes will have sunk into
the profoundest obscurity, when many pencil-marks of
<span class="smcap">Mr. Cruikshank</span> and of <span class="smcap">Mr. Leech</span> will be still fresh
in half the houses in the land?"</p>

<p>Of what otherwise occupied him at Broadstairs in
1848 there is not much to mention until the close of
his holiday. He used to say that he never went for
more than a couple of days from his own home without
something befalling him that never happened to anyone
else, and his Broadstairs adventure of the present
summer verged closer on tragedy than comedy. Returning
there one day in August after bringing up his
boys to school, it had been arranged that his wife
should meet him at Margate; but he had walked impatiently
far beyond the place for meeting when at last
he caught sight of her, not in the small chaise but in a
large carriage and pair followed by an excited crowd,
and with the youth that should have been driving the
little pony bruised and bandaged on the box behind
the two prancing horses. "You may faintly imagine
my amazement at encountering this carriage, and the
strange people, and Kate, and the crowd, and the bandaged
one, and all the rest of it." And then in a line
or two I had the story. "At the top of a steep hill
on the road, with a ditch on each side, the pony bolted,
upon which what does John do but jump out! He says<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_419" id="Page_2_419">[419]</a></span>
he was thrown out, but it cannot be. The reins immediately
became entangled in the wheels, and away went
the pony down the hill madly, with Kate inside rending
the Isle of Thanet with her screams. The accident
might have been a fearful one, if the pony had not,
thank Heaven, on getting to the bottom, pitched over
the side; breaking the shaft and cutting her hind legs,
but in the most extraordinary manner smashing her
own way apart. She tumbled down, a bundle of legs
with her head tucked underneath, and left the chaise
standing on the bank! A Captain Devaynes and his
wife were passing in their carriage at the moment, saw
the accident with no power of preventing it, got Kate
out, laid her on the grass, and behaved with infinite
kindness. All's well that ends well, and I think she's
really none the worse for the fright. John is in bed a
good deal bruised, but without any broken bone, and
likely soon to come right; though for the present plastered
all over, and, like Squeers, a brown-paper parcel
chock-full of nothing but groans. The women generally
have no sympathy for him whatever; and the nurse
says, with indignation, how could he go and leave an
unprotected female in the shay!"</p>

<p>Holiday incidents there were many, but none that
need detain us. This was really a summer idleness:
for it was the interval between two of his important
undertakings, there was no periodical yet to make demands
on him, and only the task of finishing his
<i>Haunted Man</i> for Christmas lay ahead. But he did
even his nothings in a strenuous way, and on occasion
could make gallant fight against the elements themselves.
He reported himself, to my horror, thrice wet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_420" id="Page_2_420">[420]</a></span>
through on a single day, "dressed four times," and
finding all sorts of great things, brought out by the
rains, among the rocks on the sea-beach. He also
sketched now and then morsels of character for me, of
which I will preserve one. "F is philosophical, from
sunrise to bedtime: chiefly in the French line, about
French women going mad, and in that state coming
to their husbands, and saying, 'Mon ami, je vous ai
tromp&eacute;. Voici les lettres de mon amant!' Whereupon
the husbands take the letters and think them waste
paper, and become extra-philosophical at finding that
they really <i>were</i> the lover's effusions: though what
there is of philosophy in it all, or anything but unwholesomeness,
it is not easy to see." (A remark that it
might not be out of place to offer to Mr. Taine's
notice.) "Likewise about dark shades coming over our
wedded Emmeline's face at parties; and about F handing
her to her carriage, and saying, 'May I come in,
for a lift homeward?' and she bending over him out of
window, and saying in a low voice, <span class="smcap">I dare not!</span> And
then of the carriage driving away like lightning, leaving
F more philosophical than ever on the pavement."
Not till the close of September I heard of work intruding
itself, in a letter twitting me for a broken promise
in not joining him: "We are reasonably jolly, but
rurally so; going to bed o' nights at ten, and bathing
o' mornings at half-past seven; and not drugging ourselves
with those dirty and spoiled waters of Lethe that
flow round the base of the great pyramid." Then,
after mention of the friends who had left him, Sheriff
Gordon, the Leeches, Lemon, Egg and Stone: "reflection
and pensiveness are coming. I have <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_421" id="Page_2_421">[421]</a></span><span class="smcap">not</span></p>

<div class='poem'><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">'&mdash;seen Fancy write</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With a pencil of light</span><br />
On the blotter so solid, commanding the sea!'<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>but I shouldn't wonder if she were to do it, one of
these days. Dim visions of divers things are floating
around me; and I must go to work, head foremost,
when I get home. I am glad, after all, that I have
not been at it here; for I am all the better for my
idleness, no doubt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Roche was very ill last night,
and looks like one with his face turned to the other
world, this morning. When <i>are</i> you coming? Oh
what days and nights there have been here, this week
past!" My consent to a suggestion in his next letter,
that I should meet him on his way back, and join him
in a walking-excursion home, got me full absolution
for broken promises; and the way we took will remind
friends of his later life, when he was lord of Gadshill,
of an object of interest which he delighted in taking
them to see. "You will come down booked for Maidstone
(I will meet you at Paddock-wood), and we will
go thither in company over a most beautiful little line
of railroad. The eight miles walk from Maidstone to
Rochester, and the visit to the Druidical altar on the
wayside, are charming. This could be accomplished
on the Tuesday; and Wednesday we might look about
us at Chatham, coming home by Cobham on Thursday.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</div>

<p>His first seaside holiday in 1849 was at Brighton,
where he passed some weeks in February; and not, I
am bound to add, without the usual <i>un</i>usual adventure
to signalize his visit. He had not been a week in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_422" id="Page_2_422">[422]</a></span>
lodgings, where Leech and his wife joined him, when
both his landlord and the daughter of his landlord
went raving mad, and the lodgers were driven away
to the Bedford hotel. "If you could have heard the
cursing and crying of the two; could have seen the
physician and nurse quoited out into the passage by
the madman at the hazard of their lives; could have
seen Leech and me flying to the doctor's rescue; could
have seen our wives pulling us back; could have seen
the M.D. faint with fear; could have seen three other
M.D.'s come to his aid; with an atmosphere of Mrs.
Gamps, strait-waistcoats, struggling friends and servants,
surrounding the whole; you would have said
it was quite worthy of me, and quite in keeping with
my usual proceedings." The letter ended with a word
on what then his thoughts were full of, but for which
no name had yet been found. "A sea-fog to-day, but
yesterday inexpressibly delicious. My mind running,
like a high sea, on names&mdash;not satisfied yet, though."
When he next wrote from the seaside, in the beginning
of July, he had found the name; had started his
book; and was "rushing to Broadstairs" to write the
fourth number of <i>David Copperfield</i>.</p>

<p>In this came the childish experiences which had left
so deep an impression upon him, and over which he
had some difficulty in throwing the needful disguises.
"Fourteen miles to-day in the country," he had written
to me on the 21st of June, "revolving number
four!" Still he did not quite see his way. Three
days later he wrote: "On leaving you last night, I
found myself summoned on a special jury in the
Queen's Bench to-day. I have taken no notice of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_423" id="Page_2_423">[423]</a></span>
the document,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and hourly expect to be dragged forth
to a dungeon for contempt of court. I think I should
rather like it. It might help me with a new notion or
two in my difficulties. Meanwhile I shall take a stroll
to-night in the green fields from 7 to 10, if you feel
inclined to join." His troubles ended when he got
to Broadstairs, from which he wrote on the tenth of
July to tell me that agreeably to the plan we had discussed
he had introduced a great part of his MS. into
the number. "I really think I have done it ingeniously,
and with a very complicated interweaving of
truth and fiction. Vous verrez. I am getting on like
a house afire in point of health, and ditto ditto in
point of number."</p>

<p>In the middle of July the number was nearly done,
and he was still doubtful where to pass his longer summer
holiday. Leech wished to join him in it, and
both desired a change from Broadstairs. At first he
thought of Folkestone,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> but disappointment there led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_424" id="Page_2_424">[424]</a></span>
to a sudden change. "I propose" (15th of July)
"returning to town to-morrow by the boat from Ramsgate,
and going off to Weymouth or the Isle of Wight,
or both, early the next morning." A few days after,
his choice was made.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_425" id="Page_2_425">[425]</a></span></p>
<p>He had taken a house at Bonchurch, attracted there
by the friend who had made it a place of interest
for him during the last few years, the Reverend James
White, with whose name and its associations my mind
connects inseparably many of Dickens's happiest hours.
To pay him fitting tribute would not be easy, if here it
were called for. In the kindly shrewd Scotch face, a
keen sensitiveness to pleasure and pain was the first
thing that struck any common observer. Cheerfulness
and gloom coursed over it so rapidly that no one could
question the tale they told. But the relish of his life
had outlived its more than usual share of sorrows; and
quaint sly humour, love of jest and merriment, capital
knowledge of books, and sagacious quips at men, made
his companionship delightful. Like his life, his genius
was made up of alternations of mirth and melancholy.
He would be immersed, at one time, in those darkest
Scottish annals from which he drew his tragedies; and
overflowing, at another, into Sir Frizzle Pumpkin's exuberant
farce. The tragic histories may probably perish
with the actor's perishable art; but three little abstracts
of history written at a later time in prose, with a sunny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_426" id="Page_2_426">[426]</a></span>
clearness of narration and a glow of picturesque interest
to my knowledge unequalled in books of such small
pretension, will find, I hope, a lasting place in literature.
They are filled with felicities of phrase, with
breadth of understanding and judgment, with manful
honesty, quiet sagacity, and a constant cheerful piety,
valuable for all and priceless for the young. Another
word I permit myself to add. With Dickens, White
was popular supremely for his eager good fellowship;
and few men brought him more of what he always liked
to receive. But he brought nothing so good as his
wife. "He is excellent, but she is better," is the pithy
remark of his first Bonchurch letter; and the true affection
and respect that followed is happily still borne
her by his daughters.</p>

<p>Of course there is something strange to be recorded
of the Bonchurch holiday, but it does not come till
nearer the ending; and, with more attention to Mrs.
Malaprop's advice to begin with a little aversion, might
probably not have come at all. He began with an
excess of liking. Of the Undercliff he was full of
admiration. "From the top of the highest downs,"
he wrote in his second letter (28th of July) "there are
views which are only to be equalled on the Genoese
shore of the Mediterranean; the variety of walks is extraordinary;
things are cheap, and everybody is civil.
The waterfall acts wonderfully, and the sea bathing is
delicious. Best of all, the place is certainly cold rather
than hot, in the summer time. The evenings have been
even chilly. White very jovial, and emulous of the
inimitable in respect of gin-punch. He had made some
for our arrival. Ha! ha! not bad for a beginner.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_427" id="Page_2_427">[427]</a></span>
I have been, and am, trying to work this morning; but
I can't make anything of it, and am going out to think.
I am invited by a distinguished friend to dine with you
on the first of August, but I have pleaded distance and
the being resident in a cave on the sea shore; my food,
beans; my drink, the water from the rock.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I must
pluck up heart of grace to write to Jeffrey, of whom I
had but poor accounts from Gordon just before leaving.
Talfourd delightful, and amuses me mightily. I am
really quite enraptured at his success, and think of his
happiness with uncommon pleasure." Our friend was
now on the bench; which he adorned with qualities
that are justly the pride of that profession, and with
accomplishments that have become more rare in its
highest places than they were in former times. His
elevation only made those virtues better known. Talfourd
assumed nothing with the ermine but the privilege
of more frequent intercourse with the tastes and
friends he loved, and he continued to be the most
joyous and least affected of companions. Such small
oddities or foibles as he had made him secretly only
dearer to Dickens, who had no friend he was more
attached to; and the many happy nights made happier
by the voice so affluent in generous words, and the face
so bright with ardent sensibility, come back to me sorrowfully
now. "Deaf the prais'd ear, and mute the
tuneful tongue." The poet's line has a double application
and sadness.</p>

<p>He wrote again on the first of August. "I have just
begun to get into work. We are expecting the Queen
to come by very soon, in grand array, and are going
to let off ever so many guns. I had a letter from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_428" id="Page_2_428">[428]</a></span>
Jeffrey yesterday morning, just as I was going to write
to him. He has evidently been very ill, and I begin
to have fears for his recovery. It is a very pathetic
letter, as to his state of mind; but only in a tranquil
contemplation of death, which I think very noble."
His next letter, four days later, described himself as
continuing still at work; but also taking part in dinners
at Blackgang, and picnics of "tremendous success" on
Shanklin Down. "Two charity sermons for the school
are preached to-day, and I go to the afternoon one.
The examination of said school t'other day was very
funny. All the boys made Buckstone's bow in the
<i>Rough Diamond</i>, and some in a very wonderful manner
recited pieces of poetry, about a clock, and may we
be like the clock, which is always a going and a doing
of its duty, and always tells the truth (supposing it to
be a slap-up chronometer I presume, for the American
clock in the school was lying frightfully at that
moment); and after being bothered to death by the
multiplication table, they were refreshed with a public
tea in Lady Jane Swinburne's garden." (There was a
reference in one of his letters, but I have lost it, to a
golden-haired lad of the Swinburnes whom his own boys
used to play with, since become more widely known.)
"The rain came in with the first tea-pot, and has been
active ever since. On Friday we had a grand, and
what is better, a very good dinner at 'parson' Fielden's,
with some choice port. On Tuesday we are going on
another picnic; with the materials for a fire, at my express
stipulation; and a great iron pot to boil potatoes
in. These things, and the eatables, go to the ground
in a cart. Last night we had some very good merriment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_429" id="Page_2_429">[429]</a></span>
at White's, where pleasant Julian Young and his
wife (who are staying about five miles off) showed
some droll new games"&mdash;and roused the ambition in
my friend to give a "mighty conjuring performance
for all the children in Bonchurch," for which I sent
him the materials and which went off in a tumult of
wild delight. To the familiar names in this letter I
will add one more, grieving freshly even now to connect
it with suffering. "A letter from Poole has
reached me since I began this letter, with tidings in it
that you will be very sorry to hear. Poor Regnier has
lost his only child; the pretty daughter who dined with
us that nice day at your house, when we all pleased the
poor mother by admiring her so much. She died
of a sudden attack of malignant typhus. Poole was
at the funeral, and writes that he never saw, or could
have imagined, such intensity of grief as Regnier's at
the grave. How one loves him for it. But is it not
always true, in comedy and in tragedy, that the more
real the man the more genuine the actor?"</p>

<p>After a few more days I heard of progress with his
writing in spite of all festivities. "I have made it a
rule that the inimitable is invisible, until two every
day. I shall have half the number done, please God,
to-morrow. I have not worked quickly here yet, but I
don't know what I <i>may</i> do. Divers cogitations have
occupied my mind at intervals, respecting the dim design."
The design was the weekly periodical so often
in his thoughts, of which more will appear in my next
chapter. His letter closed with intimations of discomfort
in his health; of an obstinate cough; and of a
determination he had formed to mount daily to the top<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_430" id="Page_2_430">[430]</a></span>
of the downs. "It makes a great difference in the
climate to get a blow there and come down again."
Then I heard of the doctor "stethoscoping" him, of
his hope that all was right in that quarter, and of rubbings
"&agrave; la St. John Long" being ordered for his
chest. But the mirth still went on. "There has been
a Doctor Lankester at Sandown, a very good merry
fellow, who has made one at the picnics, and whom I
went over and dined with, along with Danby (I remember
your liking for Danby, and don't wonder at it),
Leech, and White." A letter towards the close of
August resumed yet more of his ordinary tone. "We
had games and forfeits last night at White's. Davy
Roberts's pretty little daughter is there for a week, with
her husband, Bicknell's son. There was a dinner first
to say good-bye to Danby, who goes to other clergyman's-duty,
and we were very merry. Mrs. White
unchanging; White comically various in his moods.
Talfourd comes down next Tuesday, and we think of
going over to Ryde on Monday, visiting the play,
sleeping there (I don't mean at the play), and bringing
the Judge back. Browne is coming down when
he has done his month's work. Should you like to go
to Alum Bay while you are here? It would involve a
night out, but I think would be very pleasant; and if
you think so too, I will arrange it sub ros&acirc;, so that we
may not be, like Bobadil, 'oppressed by numbers.' I
mean to take a fly over from Shanklin to meet you at
Ryde; so that we can walk back from Shanklin over
the landslip, where the scenery is wonderfully beautiful.
Stone and Egg are coming next month, and we hope
to see Jerrold before we go." Such notices from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_431" id="Page_2_431">[431]</a></span>
letters may be thought hardly worth preserving; but a
wonderful vitality in every circumstance, as long as life
under any conditions remained to the writer, is the
picture they contribute to; nor would it be complete
without the addition, that fond as he was, in the intervals
of his work, of this abundance and variety of
enjoyments, to no man were so essential also those
quieter hours of thought, and talk, not obtainable when
"oppressed by numbers."</p>

<p>My visit was due at the opening of September, but
a few days earlier came the full revelation of which only
a passing shadow had reached in two or three previous
letters. "Before I think of beginning my next number,
I perhaps cannot do better than give you an imperfect
description of the results of the climate of Bonchurch
after a few weeks' residence. The first salubrious effect
of which the Patient becomes conscious is an almost
continual feeling of sickness, accompanied with great
prostration of strength, so that his legs tremble under
him, and his arms quiver when he wants to take hold
of any object. An extraordinary disposition to sleep
(except at night, when his rest, in the event of his
having any, is broken by incessant dreams) is always
present at the same time; and, if he have anything to do
requiring thought and attention, this overpowers him
to such a degree that he can only do it in snatches:
lying down on beds in the fitful intervals. Extreme
depression of mind, and a disposition to shed tears
from morning to night, developes itself at the same
period. If the Patient happen to have been a good
walker, he finds ten miles an insupportable distance;
in the achievement of which his legs are so unsteady,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_432" id="Page_2_432">[432]</a></span>
that he goes from side to side of the road, like a
drunken man. If he happen to have ever possessed
any energy of any kind, he finds it quenched in a dull,
stupid languor. He has no purpose, power, or object
in existence whatever. When he brushes his hair in
the morning, he is so weak that he is obliged to sit
upon a chair to do it. He is incapable of reading, at
all times. And his bilious system is so utterly overthrown,
that a ball of boiling fat appears to be always
behind the top of the bridge of his nose, simmering
between his haggard eyes. If he should have caught
a cold, he will find it impossible to get rid of it, as his
system is wholly incapable of making any effort. His
cough will be deep, monotonous, and constant. 'The
faithful watch-dog's honest bark' will be nothing to it.
He will abandon all present idea of overcoming it,
and will content himself with keeping an eye upon
his blood-vessels to preserve them whole and sound.
<i>Patient's name, Inimitable B.</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It's a mortal mistake!&mdash;That's
the plain fact. Of all the places I
ever have been in, I have never been in one so difficult
to exist in, pleasantly. Naples is hot and dirty,
New York feverish, Washington bilious, Genoa exciting,
Paris rainy&mdash;but Bonchurch, smashing. I am
quite convinced that I should die here, in a year. It's
not hot, it's not close, I don't know what it is, but the
prostration of it is <i>awful</i>. Nobody here has the least
idea what I think of it; but I find, from all sorts of
hints from Kate, Georgina, and the Leeches, that they
are all affected more or less in the same way, and
find it very difficult to make head against. I make
no sign, and pretend not to know what is going on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_433" id="Page_2_433">[433]</a></span>
But they are right. I believe the Leeches will go
soon, and small blame to 'em!&mdash;For me, when I leave
here at the end of this September, I must go down to
some cold place; as Ramsgate for example, for a week
or two; or I seriously believe I shall feel the effects
of it for a long time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What do you think of
<i>that?</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The longer I live, the more I doubt the
doctors. I am perfectly convinced, that, for people
suffering under a wasting disease, this Undercliff is
madness altogether. The doctors, with the old miserable
folly of looking at one bit of a subject, take the
patient's lungs and the Undercliff's air, and settle
solemnly that they are fit for each other. But the whole
influence of the place, never taken into consideration,
is to reduce and overpower vitality. I am quite confident
that I should go down under it, as if it were so
much lead, slowly crushing me. An American resident
in Paris many years, who brought me a letter from
Olliffe, said, the day before yesterday, that he had
always had a passion for the sea never to be gratified
enough, but that after living here a month, he could
not bear to look at it; he couldn't endure the sound of
it; he didn't know how it was, but it seemed associated
with the decay of his whole powers." These
were grave imputations against one of the prettiest
places in England; but of the generally depressing influence
of that Undercliff on particular temperaments,
I had already enough experience to abate something
of the surprise with which I read the letter. What it
too bluntly puts aside are the sufferings other than his
own, projected and sheltered by what only aggravated
his; but my visit gave me proof that he had really very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_434" id="Page_2_434">[434]</a></span>
little overstated the effect upon himself. Making allowance,
which sometimes he failed to do, for special peculiarities,
and for the excitability never absent when he
had in hand an undertaking such as <i>Copperfield</i>, I observed
a nervous tendency to misgivings and apprehensions
to the last degree unusual with him, which
seemed to make the commonest things difficult; and
though he stayed out his time, and brought away
nothing that his happier associations with the place
and its residents did not long survive, he never returned
to Bonchurch.</p>

<p>In the month that remained he completed his fifth
number, and with the proof there came the reply to
some questions of which I hardly remember more than
that they referred to doubts of mine; one being as to
the propriety of the kind of delusion he had first given
to poor Mr. Dick,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> which I thought a little too farcical
for that really touching delineation of character.
"Your suggestion is perfectly wise and sound," he
wrote back (22nd of August). "I have acted on it.
I have also, instead of the bull and china-shop delusion,
given Dick the idea, that, when the head of king
Charles the First was cut off, some of the trouble was
taken out of it, and put into his (Dick's)". When he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_435" id="Page_2_435">[435]</a></span>
next wrote, there was news very welcome to me for
the pleasure to himself it involved. "Browne has
sketched an uncommonly characteristic and capital
Mr. Micawber for the next number. I hope the present
number is a good one. I hear nothing but pleasant
accounts of the general satisfaction." The same letter
told me of an intention to go to Broadstairs, put aside
by doubtful reports of its sanitary condition; but it will
be seen presently that there was another graver interruption.
With his work well off his hands, however,
he had been getting on better where he was; and they
had all been very merry. "Yes," he said, writing
after a couple of days (23rd of September), "we have
been sufficiently rollicking since I finished the number;
and have had great games at rounders every
afternoon, with all Bonchurch looking on; but I begin
to long for a little peace and solitude. And now for
my less pleasing piece of news. The sea has been running
very high, and Leech, while bathing, was knocked
over by a bad blow from a great wave on the forehead.
He is in bed, and had twenty of his namesakes on his
temples this morning. When I heard of him just now,
he was asleep&mdash;which he had not been all night." He
closed his letter hopefully, but next day (24th September)
I had less favourable report. "Leech has been
very ill with congestion of the brain ever since I wrote,
and being still in excessive pain has had ice to his head
continuously, and been bled in the arm besides. Beard
and I sat up there, all night." On the 26th he wrote,
"My plans are all unsettled by Leech's illness; as of
course I do not like to leave this place while I can be
of any service to him and his good little wife. But all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_436" id="Page_2_436">[436]</a></span>
visitors are gone to-day, and Winterbourne once more
left to the engaging family of the inimitable B. Ever
since I wrote to you Leech has been seriously worse,
and again very heavily bled. The night before last he
was in such an alarming state of restlessness, which nothing
could relieve, that I proposed to Mrs. Leech to try
magnetism. Accordingly, in the middle of the night
I fell to; and after a very fatiguing bout of it, put him
to sleep for an hour and thirty-five minutes. A change
came on in the sleep, and he is decidedly better. I
talked to the astounded little Mrs. Leech across him,
when he was asleep, as if he had been a truss of hay.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
What do you think of my setting up in the magnetic
line with a large brass plate? 'Terms, twenty-five
guineas per nap.'" When he wrote again on the 30th,
he had completed his sixth number; and his friend was
so clearly on the way to recovery that he was next day
to leave for Broadstairs with his wife, her sister, and
the two little girls. "I will merely add that I entreat to
be kindly remembered to Thackeray" (who had a dangerous
illness at this time); "that I think I have, without
a doubt, <i>got</i> the Periodical notion; and that I am
writing under the depressing and discomforting influence
of paying off the tribe of bills that pour in upon an
unfortunate family-young-man on the eve of a residence
like this. So no more at present from the disgusted,
though still inimitable, and always affectionate B."</p>

<p>He stayed at Broadstairs till he had finished his number
seven, and what else chiefly occupied him were
thoughts about the Periodical of which account will
presently be given. "Such a night and day of rain,"
ran his first letter, "I should think the oldest inhabitant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_437" id="Page_2_437">[437]</a></span>
never saw! and yet, in the ould formiliar Broadstairs,
I somehow or other don't mind it much. The
change has done Mamey a world of good, and I have
begun to sleep again. As for news, you might as well
ask me for dolphins. Nobody in Broadstairs&mdash;to speak
of. Certainly nobody in Ballard's. We are in the
part, which is the house next door to the hotel itself,
that we once had for three years running, and just as
quiet and snug now as it was then. I don't think I
shall return before the 20th or so, when the number
is done; but I <i>may</i>, in some inconstant freak, run
up to you before. Preliminary despatches and advices
shall be forwarded in any case to the fragrant
neighbourhood of Clare-market and the Portugal-street
burying-ground." Such was his polite designation of
my whereabouts: for which nevertheless he had secret
likings. "On the Portsmouth railway, coming here,
encountered Kenyon. On the ditto ditto at Reigate,
encountered young Dilke, and took him in tow to Canterbury.
On the ditto ditto at ditto (meaning Reigate),
encountered Fox, M. P. for Oldham, and his daughter.
All within an hour. Young Dilke great about the proposed
Exposition under the direction of H. R. H. Prince
Albert, and evincing, very pleasantly to me, unbounded
faith in our old friend his father." There was one
more letter, taking a rather gloomy view of public
affairs in connection with an inflated pastoral from
Doctor Wiseman "given out of the Flaminian Gate,"
and speaking dolefully of some family matters; which
was subscribed, each word forming a separate line,
"Yours Despondently, And Disgustedly, Wilkins Micawber."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_438" id="Page_2_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>His visit to the little watering-place in the following
year was signalised by his completion of the most famous
of his novels, and his letters otherwise were occupied
by elaborate managerial preparation for the private
performances at Knebworth. But again the plague of
itinerant music flung him into such fevers of irritation,
that he finally resolved against any renewed attempt to
carry on important work here; and the summer of
1851, when he was only busy with miscellaneous writing,
was the last of his regular residences in the place. He
then let his London house for the brief remainder of
its term; ran away at the end of May, when some
grave family sorrows had befallen him, from the crowds
and excitements of the Great Exhibition; and with
intervals of absence, chiefly at the Guild representations,
stayed in his favourite Fort-house by the sea until
October, when he took possession of Tavistock-house.
From his letters may be added a few notices of this
last holiday at Broadstairs, which he had always afterwards
a kindly word for; and to which he said pleasant
adieu in the sketch of "Our Watering-place," written
shortly before he left.</p>

<p>"It is more delightful here" (1st of June) "than I
can express. Corn growing, larks singing, garden full of
flowers, fresh air on the sea&mdash;O it is wonderful! Why
can't you come down next Saturday (bringing work)
and go back with me on Wednesday for the <i>Copperfield</i>
banquet? Concerning which, of course, I say yes to
Talfourd's kind proposal. Lemon by all means. And&mdash;don't
you think? Browne? Whosoever, besides,
pleases Talfourd will please me." Great was the success
of that banquet. The scene was the Star-and-Garter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_439" id="Page_2_439">[439]</a></span>
at Richmond; Thackeray and Alfred Tennyson
joined in the celebration; and the generous giver was
in his best vein. I have rarely seen Dickens happier
than he was amid the sunshine of that day. Jerrold
and Thackeray returned to town with us; and a little
argument between them about money and its uses, led to
an avowal of Dickens about himself to which I may add
the confirmation of all our years of intercourse. "No
man," he said, "attaches less importance to the possession
of money, or less disparagement to the want of
it, than I do."</p>

<p>Vague mention of a "next book" escaped in a letter
at the end of July, on which I counselled longer abstinence.
"Good advice," he replied, "but difficult:
I wish you'd come to us and preach another kind of
abstinence. Fancy the Preventive men finding a lot
of brandy in barrels on the rocks here, the day before
yesterday! Nobody knows anything about the barrels,
of course. They were intended to have been landed
with the next tide, and to have been just covered at low
water. But the water being unusually low, the tops of
the barrels became revealed to Preventive telescopes,
and descent was made upon the brandy. They are
always at it, hereabouts, I have no doubt. And of
course B would not have had any of it. O dear no!
certainly not."</p>

<p>His reading was considerable and very various at
these intervals of labour, and in this particular summer
took in all the minor tales as well as the plays of Voltaire,
several of the novels (old favourites with him) of
Paul de Kock, Ruskin's <i>Lamps of Architecture</i>, and a
surprising number of books of African and other travel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_440" id="Page_2_440">[440]</a></span>
for which he had insatiable relish: but the notices of
all this in his letters were few. "By the bye, I observe,
reading that wonderful book the <i>French Revolution</i>
again, for the 500th time, that Carlyle, who knows
everything, don't know what Mumbo Jumbo is. It is
not an Idol. It is a secret preserved among the men
of certain African tribes, and never revealed by any of
them, for the punishment of their women. Mumbo
Jumbo comes in hideous form out of the forest, or the
mud, or the river, or where not, and flogs some woman
who has been backbiting, or scolding, or with some
other domestic mischief disturbing the general peace.
Carlyle seems to confound him with the common
Fetish; but he is quite another thing. He is a disguised
man; and all about him is a freemasons' secret
<i>among the men</i>."&mdash;"I finished the <i>Scarlet Letter</i> yesterday.
It falls off sadly after that fine opening scene.
The psychological part of the story is very much over-done,
and not truly done I think. Their suddenness of
meeting and agreeing to go away together, after all those
years, is very poor. Mr. Chillingworth ditto. The
child out of nature altogether. And Mr. Dimmisdale
certainly never could have begotten her." In Mr. Hawthorne's
earlier books he had taken especial pleasure;
his <i>Mosses from an Old Manse</i> having been the first
book he placed in my hands on his return from America,
with reiterated injunctions to read it. I will add a word
or two of what he wrote of the clever story of another
popular writer, because it hits well the sort of ability
that has become so common, which escapes the highest
point of cleverness, but stops short only at the very
verge of it. "The story extremely good indeed; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_441" id="Page_2_441">[441]</a></span>
all the strongest things of which it is capable, missed.
It shows just how far that kind of power can go. It is
more like a note of the idea than anything else. It
seems to me as if it were written by somebody who
lived next door to the people, rather than inside of 'em."</p>

<p>I joined him for the August regatta and stayed a
pleasant fortnight. His paper on "Our Watering-place"
appeared while I was there, and great was the
local excitement. His own restlessness with fancies
for a new book had now risen beyond bounds, and for
the time he was eager to open it in that prettiest
quaintest bit of English landscape, Strood valley,
which reminded him always of a Swiss scene. I had
not left him many days when these lines followed me.
"I very nearly packed up a portmanteau and went
away, the day before yesterday, into the mountains of
Switzerland, alone! Still the victim of an intolerable
restlessness, I shouldn't be at all surprised if I wrote to
you one of these mornings from under Mont Blanc. I
sit down between whiles to think of a new story, and, as
it begins to grow, such a torment of a desire to be anywhere
but where I am; and to be going I don't know
where, I don't know why; takes hold of me, that it is
like being <i>driven away</i>. If I had had a passport, I
sincerely believe I should have gone to Switzerland the
night before last. I should have remembered our engagement&mdash;say,
at Paris, and have come back for it; but
should probably have left by the next express train."</p>

<p>At the end of November, when he had settled himself
in his new London abode, the book was begun; and
as generally happened with the more important incidents
of his life, but always accidentally, begun on a Friday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been seen that his fancy for his Christmas
book of 1848 first arose to him at Lausanne in the summer
of 1846, and that, after writing its opening pages
in the autumn of the following year, he laid it aside
under the pressure of his <i>Dombey</i>. These lines were
in the letter that closed his 1848 Broadstairs holiday.
"At last I am a mentally matooring of the Christmas
book&mdash;or, as poor Macrone<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> used to write, 'booke,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_443" id="Page_2_443">[443]</a></span>
'boke,' 'buke,' &amp;c." It was the first labour to which
he applied himself at his return.</p>

<p>In London it soon came to maturity; was published
duly as <i>The Haunted Man, or the Ghost's Bargain;</i>
sold largely, beginning with a subscription of twenty
thousand; and had a great success on the Adelphi
stage, to which it was rather cleverly adapted by
Lemon. He had placed on its title page originally
four lines from Tennyson's "Departure,"</p>

<div class='poem'><br />
"And o'er the hills, and far away<br />

<div class='unindent'>but they were less applicable to the close than to the
opening of the tale, and were dropped before publication.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_444" id="Page_2_444">[444]</a></span>
The hero is a great chemist, a lecturer at an
old foundation, a man of studious philosophic habits,
haunted with recollections of the past "o'er which his
melancholy sits on brood," thinking his knowledge of
the present a worthier substitute, and at last parting
with that portion of himself which he thinks he can
safely cast away. The recollections are of a great
wrong done him in early life, and of all the sorrow
consequent upon it; and the ghost he holds nightly
conference with, is the darker presentiment of himself
embodied in those bitter recollections. This part is
finely managed. Out of heaped-up images of gloomy
and wintry fancies, the supernatural takes a shape which
is not forced or violent; and the dialogue which is no
dialogue, but a kind of dreary dreamy echo, is a piece
of ghostly imagination better than Mrs. Radcliffe. The
boon desired is granted and the bargain struck. He
is not only to lose his own recollection of grief and
wrong, but to destroy the like memory in all whom he
approaches. By this means the effect is shown in
humble as well as higher minds, in the worst poverty
as in competence or ease, always with the same result.
The over-thinking sage loses his own affections and
sympathy, sees them crushed in others, and is brought
to the level of the only creature whom he cannot
change or influence, an outcast of the streets, a boy
whom the mere animal appetites have turned into a
small fiend. Never having had his mind awakened,
evil is this creature's good; avarice, irreverence, and
vindictiveness, are his nature; sorrow has no place in
his memory; and from his brutish propensities the
philosopher can take nothing away. The juxtaposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_445" id="Page_2_445">[445]</a></span>
of two people whom such opposite means have put in
the same moral position is a stroke of excellent art.
There are plenty of incredibilities and inconsistencies,
just as in the pleasant <i>Cricket on the Hearth</i>, which
one does not care about, but enjoy rather than otherwise;
and, as in that charming little book, there were
minor characters as delightful as anything in Dickens.
The Tetterby group, in whose humble, homely, kindly,
ungainly figures there is everything that could suggest
itself to a clear eye, a piercing wit, and a loving heart,
became enormous favourites. Tilly Slowboy and her
little dot of a baby, charging folks with it as if it were
an offensive instrument, or handing it about as if it
were something to drink, were not more popular than
poor Johnny Tetterby staggering under his Moloch of
an infant, the Juggernaut that crushes all his enjoyments.
The story itself consists of nothing more than
the effects of the Ghost's gift upon the various groups
of people introduced, and the way the end is arrived at
is very specially in Dickens's manner. What the highest
exercise of the intellect had missed is found in the
simplest form of the affections. The wife of the custodian
of the college where the chemist is professor, in
whom are all the unselfish virtues that can beautify and
endear the humblest condition, is the instrument of the
change. Such sorrow as she had suffered had made
her only zealous to relieve others' sufferings: and the
discontented wise man learns from her example that
the world is, after all, a much happier compromise than
it seems to be, and life easier than wisdom is apt to
think it; that grief gives joy its relish, purifying what
it touches truly; and that "sweet are the uses of adversity"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_446" id="Page_2_446">[446]</a></span>
when its clouds are not the shadow of dishonour.
All this can be shown but lightly within such
space, it is true; and in the machinery a good deal has
to be taken for granted. But Dickens was quite justified
in turning aside from objections of that kind.
"You must suppose," he wrote to me (21st of November),
"that the Ghost's saving clause gives him those
glimpses without which it would be impossible to carry
out the idea. Of course my point is that bad and good
are inextricably linked in remembrance, and that you
could not choose the enjoyment of recollecting only
the good. To have all the best of it you must remember
the worst also. My intention in the other point
you mention is, that he should not know himself how
he communicates the gift, whether by look or touch;
and that it should diffuse itself in its own way in each
case. I can make this clearer by a very few lines in
the second part. It is not only necessary to be so, for
the variety of the story, but I think it makes the thing
wilder and stranger." Critical niceties are indeed out
of place, where wildness and strangeness in the means
matter less than that there should be clearness in the
drift and intention. Dickens leaves no doubt as to
this. He thoroughly makes out his fancy, that no man
should so far question the mysterious dispensations of
evil in this world as to desire to lose the recollection
of such injustice or misery as he may suppose it to have
done to himself. There may have been sorrow, but
there was the kindness that assuaged it; there may
have been wrong, but there was the charity that forgave
it; and with both are connected inseparably so many
thoughts that soften and exalt whatever else is in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_447" id="Page_2_447">[447]</a></span>
sense of memory, that what is good and pleasurable
in life would cease to continue so if these were forgotten.
The old proverb does not tell you to forget
that you may forgive, but to forgive that you may forget.
It is forgiveness of wrong, for forgetfulness of the evil
that was in it; such as poor old Lear begged of
Cordelia.</div>

<p>The design for his much-thought-of new Periodical
was still "dim," as we have seen, when the first cogitation
of it at Bonchurch occupied him; but the expediency
of making it clearer came soon after with a visit
from Mr. Evans, who brought his half-year's accounts
of sales, and some small disappointment for him in
those of <i>Copperfield</i>. "The accounts are rather shy,
after <i>Dombey</i>, and what you said comes true after all.
I am not sorry I cannot bring myself to care much for
what opinions people may form; and I have a strong
belief, that, if any of my books are read years hence,
<i>Dombey</i> will be remembered as among the best of them:
but passing influences are important for the time, and
as <i>Chuzzlewit</i> with its small sale sent me up, <i>Dombey's</i>
large sale has tumbled me down. Not very much, however,
in real truth. These accounts only include the
first three numbers, have of course been burdened with
all the heavy expenses of number one, and ought not
in reason to be complained of. But it is clear to me
that the Periodical must be set agoing in the spring;
and I have already been busy, at odd half-hours, in
shadowing forth a name and an idea. Evans says they
have but one opinion repeated to them of <i>Copperfield</i>,
and they feel very confident about it. A steady twenty-five
thousand, which it is now on the verge of, will do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_448" id="Page_2_448">[448]</a></span>
very well. The back numbers are always going off.
Read the enclosed."</p>

<p>It was a letter from a Russian man of letters, dated
from St. Petersburg and signed "Trinarch Ivansvitch
Wredenskii," sending him a translation of <i>Dombey</i>
into Russian; and informing him that his works, which
before had only been translated in the journals, and
with certain omissions, had now been translated in their
entire form by his correspondent, though even he had
found an omission to be necessary in his version of
<i>Pickwick</i>. He adds, with an exquisite courtesy to our
national tongue which is yet not forgetful of the claims
of his own nationality, that his difficulties (in the Sam
Weller direction and others) had arisen from the "impossibility
of portraying faithfully the beauties of the
original in the Russian language, which, though the
richest in Europe in its expressiveness, is far from being
elaborate enough for literature like other civilized languages."
He had however, he assured Dickens, been
unremitting in his efforts to live with his thoughts;
and the exalted opinion he had formed of them was
attended by only one wish, that such a writer "could
but have expanded under a Russian sky!" Still, his
fate was an enviable one. "For the last eleven years
your name has enjoyed a wide celebrity in Russia, and
from the banks of the Neva to the remotest parts of
Siberia you are read with avidity. Your <i>Dombey</i> continues
to inspire with enthusiasm the whole of the literary
Russia." Much did we delight in the good
Wredenskii; and for a long time, on anything going
"contrairy" in the public or private direction with
him, he would tell me he had ordered his portmanteau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_449" id="Page_2_449">[449]</a></span>
to be packed for the more sympathizing and congenial
climate of "the remotest parts of Siberia."</p>

<p>The week before he left Bonchurch I again had news
of the old and often recurring fancy. "The old notion
of the Periodical, which has been agitating itself
in my mind for so long, I really think is at last gradually
growing into form." That was on the 24th of
September; and on the 7th of October, from Broadstairs,
I had something of the form it had been taking.
"I do great injustice to my floating ideas (pretty
speedily and comfortably settling down into orderly
arrangement) by saying anything about the Periodical
now: but my notion is a weekly journal, price either
three-halfpence or two-pence, matter in part original
and in part selected, and always having, if possible,
a little good poetry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Upon the selected matter, I
have particular notions. One is, that it should always
be <i>a subject</i>. For example, a history of Piracy; in
connexion with which there is a vast deal of extraordinary,
romantic, and almost unknown matter. A history
of Knight-errantry, and the wild old notion of
the Sangreal. A history of Savages, showing the singular
respects in which all savages are like each other;
and those in which civilised men, under circumstances
of difficulty, soonest become like savages. A history
of remarkable characters, good and bad, <i>in</i> history;
to assist the reader's judgment in his observation of
men, and in his estimates of the truth of many characters
in fiction. All these things, and fifty others
that I have already thought of, would be compilations;
through the whole of which the general intellect and
purpose of the paper should run, and in which there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_450" id="Page_2_450">[450]</a></span>
would be scarcely less interest than in the original
matter. The original matter to be essays, reviews,
letters, theatrical criticisms, &amp;c., &amp;c., as amusing as
possible, but all distinctly and boldly going to what in
one's own view ought to be the spirit of the people
and the time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now to bind all this together, and
to get a character established as it were which any of
the writers may maintain without difficulty, I want to
suppose a certain <span class="smcap">Shadow</span>, which may go into any
place, by sunlight, moonlight, starlight, firelight,
candlelight, and be in all homes, and all nooks and
corners, and be supposed to be cognisant of everything,
and go everywhere, without the least difficulty.
Which may be in the Theatre, the Palace, the House
of Commons, the Prisons, the Unions, the Churches,
on the Railroad, on the Sea, abroad and at home:
a kind of semi-omniscient, omnipresent, intangible
creature. I don't think it would do to call the paper
<span class="smcap">The Shadow</span>: but I want something tacked to that
title, to express the notion of its being a cheerful, useful,
and always welcome Shadow. I want to open the
first number with this Shadow's account of himself and
his family. I want to have all the correspondence addressed
to him. I want him to issue his warnings from
time to time, that he is going to fall on such and such
a subject; or to expose such and such a piece of humbug;
or that he may be expected shortly in such and
such a place. I want the compiled part of the paper
to express the idea of this Shadow's having been in
libraries, and among the books referred to. I want
him to loom as a fanciful thing all over London; and
to get up a general notion of 'What will the Shadow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_451" id="Page_2_451">[451]</a></span>
say about this, I wonder? What will the Shadow say
about that? Is the Shadow here?' and so forth. Do
you understand?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have an enormous difficulty in
expressing what I mean, in this stage of the business;
but I think the importance of the idea is, that once
stated on paper, there is no difficulty in keeping it up.
That it presents an odd, unsubstantial, whimsical,
new thing: a sort of previously unthought-of Power
going about. That it will concentrate into one focus all
that is done in the paper. That it sets up a creature
which isn't the Spectator, and isn't Isaac Bickerstaff,
and isn't anything of that kind: but in which people
will be perfectly willing to believe, and which is just
mysterious and quaint enough to have a sort of charm
for their imagination, while it will represent common-sense
and humanity. I want to express in the title,
and in the grasp of the idea to express also, that it is
the Thing at everybody's elbow, and in everybody's
footsteps. At the window, by the fire, in the street,
in the house, from infancy to old age, everyone's inseparable
companion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now do you make anything
out of this? which I let off as if I were a bladder full
of it, and you had punctured me. I have not breathed
the idea to any one; but I have a lively hope that it
<i>is</i> an idea, and that out of it the whole scheme may be
hammered."</p>

<p>Excellent the idea doubtless, and so described in his
letter that hardly anything more characteristic survives
him. But I could not make anything out of it that
had a quite feasible look. The ordinary ground of
miscellaneous reading, selection, and compilation out
of which it was to spring, seemed to me no proper soil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_452" id="Page_2_452">[452]</a></span>
for the imaginative produce it was meant to bear. As
his fancies grew and gathered round it, they had given
it too much of the range and scope of his own exhaustless
land of invention and marvel; and the very means
proposed for letting in the help of others would only
more heavily have weighted himself. Not to trouble
the reader now with objections given him in detail, my
judgment was clear against his plan; less for any doubt
of the effect if its parts could be brought to combine,
than for my belief that it was not in that view practicable;
and though he did not immediately accept my
reasons, he acquiesced in them ultimately. "I do not
lay much stress on your grave doubts about Periodical,
but more anon." The more anon resolved itself into
conversations out of which the shape given to the project
was that which it finally took.</p>

<p>It was to be a weekly miscellany of general literature;
and its stated objects were to be, to contribute
to the entertainment and instruction of all classes of
readers, and to help in the discussion of the more important
social questions of the time. It was to comprise
short stories by others as well as himself; matters
of passing interest in the liveliest form that could be
given to them; subjects suggested by books that might
most be attracting attention; and poetry in every
number if possible, but in any case something of romantic
fancy. This was to be a cardinal point. There
was to be no mere utilitarian spirit; with all familiar
things, but especially those repellent on the surface,
something was to be connected that should be fanciful
or kindly; and the hardest workers were to be taught
that their lot is not necessarily excluded from the sympathies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_453" id="Page_2_453">[453]</a></span>
and graces of imagination. This was all finally
settled by the close of 1849, when a general announcement
of the intended adventure was made. There
remained only a title and an assistant editor; and I
am happy now to remember that for the latter important
duty Mr. Wills was chosen at my suggestion. He
discharged his duties with admirable patience and ability
for twenty years, and Dickens's later life had no more
intimate friend.</p>

<p>The title took some time and occupied many letters.
One of the first thought-of has now the curious interest
of having foreshadowed, by the motto proposed to accompany
it, the title of the series of <i>All the Year
Round</i> which he was led to substitute for the older
series in 1859. "<span class="smcap">The Robin</span>. With this motto from
Goldsmith. '<i>The redbreast, celebrated for its affection
to mankind, continues with us, the year round.</i>'" That
however was rejected. Then came: "<span class="smcap">Mankind</span>. This
I think very good." It followed the other nevertheless.
After it came: "And here a strange idea, but
with decided advantages. '<span class="smcap">Charles Dickens</span>. A
weekly journal designed for the instruction and entertainment
of all classes of readers. <span class="smcap">Conducted by
Himself</span>.'" Still, there was something wanting in
that also. Next day arrived: "I really think if there
<i>be</i> anything wanting in the other name, that this is
very pretty, and just supplies it. <span class="smcap">The Household
Voice.</span> I have thought of many others, as&mdash;<span class="smcap">The
Household Guest. The Household Face. The
Comrade. The Microscope. The Highway Of
Life. The Lever. The Rolling Years. The
Holly Tree</span> (with two lines from Southey for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_454" id="Page_2_454">[454]</a></span>
motto). <span class="smcap">Everything</span>, But I rather think the <span class="smcap">Voice</span>
is it." It was near indeed; but the following day
came, "<span class="smcap">Household Words</span>. This is a very pretty
name:" and the choice was made.</p>

<p>The first number appeared on Saturday the 30th of
March 1850, and contained among other things the
beginning of a story by a very original writer, Mrs.
Gaskell, for whose powers he had a high admiration,
and with whom he had friendly intercourse during
many years. Other opportunities will arise for mention
of those with whom this new labour brought him
into personal communication, but I may at once say
that of all the writers, before unknown, whom his
journal helped to make familiar to a wide world of
readers, he had the strongest personal interest in Mr.
Sala, and placed at once in the highest rank his capabilities
of help in such an enterprise.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> An illustrative
trait of what I have named as its cardinal point to
him will fitly close my account of its establishment.
Its first number, still unpublished, had not seemed to
him quite to fulfil his promise, "tenderly to cherish
the light of fancy inherent in all breasts;" and, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_455" id="Page_2_455">[455]</a></span>
soon as he received the proof of the second, I heard
from him. "Looking over the suggested contents of
number two at breakfast this morning" (Brighton:
14th of March 1850) "I felt an uneasy sense of there
being a want of something tender, which would apply
to some universal household knowledge. Coming down
in the railroad the other night (always a wonderfully
suggestive place to me when I am alone) I was looking
at the stars, and revolving a little idea about them.
Putting now these two things together, I wrote the enclosed
little paper, straightway; and should like you to
read it before you send it to the printers (it will not
take you five minutes), and let me have a proof by return."
This was the child's "dream of a star," which
opened his second number; and, not appearing among
his reprinted pieces, may justify a word or two of description.
It is of a brother and sister, constant child-companions,
who used to make friends of a star, watching
it together until they knew when and where it would
rise, and always bidding it good-night; so that when
the sister dies the lonely brother still connects her with
the star, which he then sees opening as a world of light,
and its rays making a shining pathway from earth to
heaven; and he also sees angels waiting to receive
travellers up that sparkling road, his little sister among
them; and he thinks ever after that he belongs less to
the earth than to the star where his sister is; and he
grows up to youth and through manhood and old age,
consoled still under the successive domestic bereavements
that fall to his earthly lot by renewal of that
vision of his childhood; until at last, lying on his own
bed of death, he feels that he is moving as a child to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_456" id="Page_2_456">[456]</a></span>
his child-sister, and he thanks his heavenly father that
the star had so often opened before to receive the dear
ones who awaited him.</p>

<p>His sister Fanny and himself, he told me long before
this paper was written, used to wander at night about
a churchyard near their house, looking up at the stars;
and her early death, of which I am now to speak, had
vividly reawakened all the childish associations which
made her memory dear to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Excepting</span> always the haunts and associations of his
childhood, Dickens had no particular sentiment of
locality, and any special regard for houses he had lived
in was not a thing noticeable in him. But he cared
most for Devonshire-terrace, perhaps for the bit of
ground attached to it; and it was with regret he suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_458" id="Page_2_458">[458]</a></span>
discovered, at the close of 1847, that he should
have to resign it "next lady-day three years. I had
thought the lease two years more." To that brief remaining
time belong some incidents of which I have
still to give account; and I connect them with the
house in which he lived during the progress of what is
generally thought his greatest book, and of what I think
were his happiest years.</p>

<p>We had never had such intimate confidences as in
the interval since his return from Paris; but these have
been used in my narrative of the childhood and boyish
experiences, and what remain are incidental only. Of
the fragment of autobiography there also given, the
origin has been told; but the intention of leaving such
a record had been in his mind, we now see, at an earlier
date; and it was the very depth of our interest in the
opening of his fragment that led to the larger design
in which it became absorbed. "I hardly know why I
write this," was his own comment on one of his personal
revelations, "but the more than friendship which
has grown between us seems to force it on me in my
present mood. We shall speak of it all, you and I,
Heaven grant, wisely and wonderingly many and many
a time in after years. In the meanwhile I am more at
rest for having opened all my heart and mind to you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
This day eleven years, poor dear Mary died."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>That was written on the seventh of May 1848, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_459" id="Page_2_459">[459]</a></span>
another sadness impending at the time was taking his
thoughts still farther back; to when he trotted about
with his little elder sister in the small garden to the
house at Portsea. The faint hope for her which Elliotson
had given him in Paris had since completely broken
down; and I was to hear, in less than two months after
the letter just quoted, how nearly the end was come.
"A change took place in poor Fanny," he wrote on
the 5th of July, "about the middle of the day yesterday,
which took me out there last night. Her cough
suddenly ceased almost, and, strange to say, she immediately
became aware of her hopeless state; to which
she resigned herself, after an hour's unrest and struggle,
with extraordinary sweetness and constancy. The irritability
passed, and all hope faded away; though only two
nights before, she had been planning for 'after Christmas.'
She is greatly changed. I had a long interview
with her to-day, alone; and when she had expressed
some wishes about the funeral, and her being
buried in unconsecrated ground" (Mr. Burnett's family
were dissenters), "I asked her whether she had any
care or anxiety in the world. She said No, none. It
was hard to die at such a time of life, but she had no
alarm whatever in the prospect of the change; felt
sure we should meet again in a better world; and although
they had said she might rally for a time, did
not really wish it. She said she was quite calm and
happy, relied upon the mediation of Christ, and had
no terror at all. She had worked very hard, even when
ill; but believed that was in her nature, and neither
regretted nor complained of it. Burnett had been
always very good to her; they had never quarrelled;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_460" id="Page_2_460">[460]</a></span>
she was sorry to think of his going back to such a
lonely home; and was distressed about her children,
but not painfully so. She showed me how thin and
worn she was; spoke about an invention she had heard
of that she would like to have tried, for the deformed
child's back; called to my remembrance all our sister
Letitia's patience and steadiness; and, though she shed
tears sometimes, clearly impressed upon me that her
mind was made up, and at rest. I asked her very
often, if she could ever recall anything that she could
leave to my doing, to put it down, or mention it to
somebody if I was not there; and she said she would,
but she firmly believed that there was nothing&mdash;nothing.
Her husband being young, she said, and her
children infants, she could not help thinking sometimes,
that it would be very long in the course of nature
before they were reunited; but she knew that was a
mere human fancy, and could have no reality after she
was dead. Such an affecting exhibition of strength
and tenderness, in all that early decay, is quite indescribable.
I need not tell you how it moved me. I
cannot look round upon the dear children here, without
some misgiving that this sad disease will not perish
out of our blood with her; but I am sure I have no
selfishness in the thought, and God knows how small
the world looks to one who comes out of such a sick-room
on a bright summer day. I don't know why I
write this before going to bed. I only know that in
the very pity and grief of my heart, I feel as if it
were doing something." After not many weeks she
died, and the little child who was her last anxiety did
not long survive her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_461" id="Page_2_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>In all the latter part of the year Dickens's thoughts
were turning much to the form his next book should
assume. A suggestion that he should write it in the
first person, by way of change, had been thrown out
by me, which he took at once very gravely; and this,
with other things, though as yet not dreaming of any
public use of his own personal and private recollections,
conspired to bring about that resolve. The determination
once taken, with what a singular truthfulness
he contrived to blend the fact with the fiction
may be shown by a small occurrence of this time. It
has been inferred, from the vividness of the boy-impressions
of Yarmouth in David's earliest experiences,
that the place must have been familiar to his own boyhood:
but the truth was that at the close of 1848 he
first saw that celebrated sea-port. One of its earlier
months had been signalised by an adventure in which
Leech, Lemon, and myself took part with him, when,
obtaining horses from Salisbury, we passed the whole
of a March day in riding over every part of the Plain;
visiting Stonehenge, and exploring Hazlitt's "hut" at
Winterslow, birthplace of some of his finest essays;
altogether with so brilliant a success that now (13th of
November) he proposed to "repeat the Salisbury Plain
idea in a new direction in mid-winter, to wit, Blackgang
Chine in the Isle of Wight, with dark winter
cliffs and roaring oceans." But mid-winter brought
with it too much dreariness of its own, to render these
stormy accompaniments to it very palatable; and on
the last day of the year he bethought him "it would
be better to make an outburst to some old cathedral
city we don't know, and what do you say to Norwich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_462" id="Page_2_462">[462]</a></span>
and Stanfield-hall?" Thither accordingly the three
friends went, illness at the last disabling me; and of
the result I heard (12th of January, 1849) that Stanfield-hall,
the scene of a recent frightful tragedy, had
nothing attractive unless the term might be applied to
"a murderous look that seemed to invite such a crime.
We arrived," continued Dickens, "between the Hall
and Potass farm, as the search was going on for the
pistol in a manner so consummately stupid, that there
was nothing on earth to prevent any of Rush's
labourers from accepting five pounds from Rush junior
to find the weapon and give it to him. Norwich, a
disappointment" (one pleasant face "transformeth a
city," but he was unable yet to connect it with our
delightful friend Elwin); "all save its place of execution,
which we found fit for a gigantic scoundrel's exit.
But the success of the trip, for me, was to come. Yarmouth,
sir, where we went afterwards, is the strangest
place in the wide world: one hundred and forty-six
miles of hill-less marsh between it and London. More
when we meet. I shall certainly try my hand at it."
He made it the home of his "little Em'ly."</p>

<p>Everything now was taking that direction with him;
and soon, to give his own account of it, his mind was
upon names "running like a high sea." Four days
after the date of the last-quoted letter ("all over happily,
thank God, by four o'clock this morning") there
came the birth of his eighth child and sixth son; whom
at first he meant to call by Oliver Goldsmith's name,
but settled afterwards into that of Henry Fielding;
and to whom that early friend Ainsworth who had first
made us known to each other, welcome and pleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_463" id="Page_2_463">[463]</a></span>
companion always, was asked to be godfather. Telling
me of the change in the name of the little fellow,
which he had made in a kind of homage to the style
of work he was now so bent on beginning, he added,
"What should you think of this for a notion of a
character? 'Yes, that is very true: but now, <i>What's
his motive?</i>' I fancy I could make something like it
into a kind of amusing and more innocent Pecksniff.
'Well now, yes&mdash;no doubt that was a fine thing to do!
But now, stop a moment, let us see&mdash;<i>What's his motive?</i>'"
Here again was but one of the many outward
signs of fancy and fertility that accompanied the outset
of all his more important books; though, as in
their cases also, other moods of the mind incident to
such beginnings were less favourable. "Deepest despondency,
as usual, in commencing, besets me;" is
the opening of the letter in which he speaks of what
of course was always one of his first anxieties, the
selection of a name. In this particular instance he
had been undergoing doubts and misgivings to more
than the usual degree. It was not until the 23rd of
February he got to anything like the shape of a feasible
title. "I should like to know how the enclosed
(one of those I have been thinking of) strikes you, on
a first acquaintance with it. It is odd, I think, and
new; but it may have A's difficulty of being 'too
comic, my boy.' I suppose I should have to add,
though, by way of motto, 'And in short it led to the
very Mag's Diversions. <i>Old Saying.</i>' Or would it be
better, there being equal authority for either, 'And in
short they all played Mag's Diversions. <i>Old Saying?</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_464" id="Page_2_464">[464]</a></span>'</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Mag's Diversions.</i><br />
Being the personal history of<br />
<span class="smcap">Mr. Thomas Mag the Younger</span>,<br />
Of Blunderstone House."<br />
</div>

<p>This was hardly satisfactory, I thought; and it soon
became apparent that he thought so too, although
within the next three days I had it in three other forms.
"<i>Mag's Diversions</i>, being the Personal History, Adventures,
Experience and Observation of Mr. David
Mag the Younger, of Blunderstone House." The second
omitted Adventures, and called his hero Mr. David
Mag the Younger, of Copperfield House. The third
made nearer approach to what the destinies were leading
him to, and transformed Mr. David Mag into Mr.
David Copperfield the Younger and his great-aunt
Margaret; retaining still as his leading title, <i>Mag's
Diversions</i>. It is singular that it should never have
occurred to him, while the name was thus strangely
as by accident bringing itself together, that the initials
were but his own reversed; but he was much startled
when I pointed this out, and protested it was just in
keeping with the fates and chances which were always
befalling him. "Why else," he said, "should I so
obstinately have kept to that name when once it turned
up?"</p>

<p>It was quite true that he did so, as I had curious
proof following close upon the heels of that third proposal.
"I wish," he wrote on the 26th of February,
"you would look over carefully the titles now enclosed,
and tell me to which you most incline. You will see
that they give up <i>Mag</i> altogether, and refer exclusively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_465" id="Page_2_465">[465]</a></span>
to one name&mdash;that which I last sent you. I doubt
whether I could, on the whole, get a better name.</p>

<div class='unindent'>Or, the opening words of No. 6 might be <i>Copperfield's
Entire;</i> and <i>The Copperfield Confessions</i> might open
Nos. 1 and 2. Now, <span class="smcap">what say you?</span>"</div>

<p>What I said is to be inferred from what he wrote
back on the 28th. "The <i>Survey</i> has been my favourite
from the first. Kate picked it out from the rest, without
my saying anything about it. Georgy too. You
hit upon it, on the first glance. Therefore I have no
doubt that it is indisputably the best title; and I will
stick to it." There was a change nevertheless. His
completion of the second chapter defined to himself,
more clearly than before, the character of the book;
and the propriety of rejecting everything not strictly
personal from the name given to it. The words proposed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_466" id="Page_2_466">[466]</a></span>
therefore, became ultimately these only: "The
Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation
of David Copperfield the Younger, of Blunderstone
Rookery, which he never meant to be published
on any account." And the letter which told me that
with this name it was finally to be launched on the
first of May, told me also (19th April) the difficulties
that still beset him at the opening. "My hand is
out in the matter of <i>Copperfield</i>. To-day and yesterday
I have done nothing. Though I know what I want to
do, I am lumbering on like a stage-waggon. I can't
even dine at the Temple to-day, I feel it so important
to stick at it this evening, and make some head.
I am quite aground; quite a literary Benedict, as
he appeared when his heels wouldn't stay upon the
carpet; and the long Copperfieldian perspective looks
snowy and thick, this fine morning."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The allusion
was to a dinner at his house the night before; when
not only Rogers had to be borne out, having fallen sick
at the table, but, as we rose soon after to quit the
dining-room, Mr. Jules Benedict had quite suddenly
followed the poet's lead, and fallen prostrate on the
carpet in the midst of us. Amid the general consternation
there seemed a want of proper attendance on the
sick: the distinguished musician faring in this respect
hardly so well as the famous bard, by whose protracted
sufferings in the library, whither he had been removed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_467" id="Page_2_467">[467]</a></span>
the sanitary help available on the establishment was
still absorbed; and as Dickens had been eloquent
during dinner on the atrocities of a pauper-farming case
at Tooting which was then exciting a fury of indignation,
Fonblanque now declared him to be no better
himself than a second Drouet, reducing his guests to a
lamentable state by the food he had given them, and
aggravating their sad condition by absence of all proper
nursing. The joke was well kept up by Quin and
Edwin Landseer, Lord Strangford joining in with a
tragic sympathy for his friend the poet; and the banquet
so dolefully interrupted ended in uproarious mirth.
For nothing really serious had happened. Benedict
went laughing away with his wife, and I helped Rogers
on with his overshoes for his usual night-walk home.
"Do you know how many waistcoats I wear?" asked
the poet of me, as I was doing him this service. I professed
my inability to guess. "Five!" he said: "and
here they are!" Upon which he opened them, in the
manner of the gravedigger in <i>Hamlet</i>, and showed me
every one.</p>

<p>That dinner was in the April of 1849, and among
others present were Mrs. Procter and Mrs. Macready,
dear and familiar names always in his house. No
swifter or surer perception than Dickens's for what was
solid and beautiful in character; he rated it higher than
intellectual effort; and the same lofty place, first in his
affection and respect, would have been Macready's
and Procter's, if the one had not been the greatest of
actors, and the other a poet as genuine as old Fletcher
or Beaumont. There were present at this dinner also
the American minister and Mrs. Bancroft (it was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_468" id="Page_2_468">[468]</a></span>
year of that visit of Macready to America, which ended
in the disastrous Forrest riots); and it had among its
guests Lady Graham, the wife of Sir James Graham,
than whom not even the wit and beauty of her nieces,
Mrs. Norton and Lady Dufferin, better represented the
brilliant family of the Sheridans; so many of whose
members, and these three above all, Dickens prized
among his friends. The table that day will be "full"
if I add the celebrated singer Miss Catherine Hayes,
and her homely good-natured Irish mother, who
startled us all very much by complimenting Mrs. Dickens
on her having had for her father so clever a painter
as Mr. Hogarth.</p>

<p>Others familiar to Devonshire-terrace in these years
will be indicated if I name an earlier dinner (3rd of
January), for the "christening" of the <i>Haunted Man</i>,
when, besides Lemons, Evanses, Leeches, Bradburys,
and Stanfields, there were present Tenniel, Topham,
Stone, Robert Bell, and Thomas Beard. Next month
(24th of March) I met at his table, Lord and Lady Lovelace;
Milner Gibson, Mowbray Morris, Horace Twiss,
and their wives; Lady Molesworth and her daughter
(Mrs. Ford); John Hardwick, Charles Babbage, and Dr.
Locock. That distinguished physician had attended
the poor girl, Miss Abercrombie, whose death by
strychnine led to the exposure of Wainewright's murders;
and the opinion he had formed of her chances
of recovery, the external indications of that poison
being then but imperfectly known, was first shaken, he
told me, by the gloomy and despairing cries of the old
family nurse, that her mother and her uncle had died
exactly so! These, it was afterwards proved, had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_469" id="Page_2_469">[469]</a></span>
among the murderer's former victims. The Lovelaces
were frequent guests after the return from Italy, Sir
George Crawford, so friendly in Genoa, having married
Lord Lovelace's sister; and few had a greater
warmth of admiration for Dickens than Lord Byron's
"Ada," on whom Paul Dombey's death laid a strange
fascination. They were again at a dinner got up in
the following year for Scribe and the composer Hal&eacute;vy,
who had come over to bring out the <i>Tempest</i> at Her
Majesty's-theatre, then managed by Mr. Lumley, who
with M. Van de Weyer, Mrs. Gore and her daughter,
the Hogarths, and I think the fine French comedian,
Samson, were also among those present. Earlier that
year there were gathered at his dinner-table the John
Delanes, Isambard Brunels, Thomas Longmans (friends
since the earliest Broadstairs days, and special favourites
always), Lord Mulgrave, and Lord Carlisle, with
all of whom his intercourse was intimate and frequent,
and became especially so with Delane in later years.
Lord Carlisle amused us that night, I remember, by
repeating what the good old Brougham had said to him
of "those <i>Punch</i> people," expressing what was really
his fixed belief. "They never get my face, and are
obliged" (which, like Pope, he always pronounced
obleeged), "to put up with my plaid trousers!" Of
Lord Mulgrave, pleasantly associated with the first
American experiences, let me add that he now went
with us to several outlying places of amusement of
which he wished to acquire some knowledge, and which
Dickens knew better than any man; small theatres,
saloons, and gardens in city or borough, to which the
Eagle and Britannia were as palaces; and I think he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_470" id="Page_2_470">[470]</a></span>
was of the party one famous night in the summer of
1849 (29th of June), when with Talfourd, Edwin
Landseer, and Stanfield, we went to the <i>Battle of
Waterloo</i> at Vauxhall, and were astounded to see pass
in immediately before us, in a bright white overcoat,
the great Duke himself, Lady Douro on his arm, the
little Ladies Ramsay by his side, and everybody cheering
and clearing the way before him. That the old
hero enjoyed it all, there could be no doubt, and he
made no secret of his delight in "Young Hernandez;"
but the "Battle" was undeniably tedious, and it was
impossible not to sympathize with the repeatedly and
very audibly expressed wish of Talfourd, that "the
Prussians would come up!"</p>

<p>The preceding month was that of the start of <i>David
Copperfield</i>, and to one more dinner (on the 12th) I
may especially refer for those who were present at it.
Carlyle and Mrs. Carlyle came, Thackeray and Rogers,
Mrs. Gaskell and Kenyon, Jerrold and Hablot Browne,
with Mr. and Mrs. Tagart; and it was a delight to see
the enjoyment of Dickens at Carlyle's laughing reply
to questions about his health, that he was, in the language
of Mr. Peggotty's housekeeper, a lorn lone creature
and everything went contrairy with him. Things
were not likely to go better, I thought, as I saw the
great writer,&mdash;kindest as well as wisest of men, but not
very patient under sentimental philosophies,&mdash;seated
next the good Mr. Tagart, who soon was heard launching
at him various metaphysical questions in regard to heaven
and such like; and the relief was great when Thackeray
introduced, with quaint whimsicality, a story which he
and I had heard Macready relate in talking to us about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_471" id="Page_2_471">[471]</a></span>
his boyish days, of a country actor who had supported
himself for six months on his judicious treatment of the
"tag" to the <i>Castle Spectre</i>. In the original it stands
that you are to do away with suspicion, banish vile mistrust,
and, almost in the words we had just heard from the
minister to the philosopher, "Believe there is a Heaven
nor Doubt that Heaven is just!" in place of which
Macready's friend, observing that the drop fell for the
most part quite coldly, substituted one night the more
telling appeal, "And give us your Applause, for <i>that</i>
is <span class="smcap">always just</span>!" which brought down the house with
rapture.</p>

<p>This chapter would far outrun its limits if I spoke
of other as pleasant gatherings under Dickens's roof
during the years which I am now more particularly
describing; when, besides the dinners, the musical
enjoyments and dancings, as his children became able
to take part in them, were incessant. "Remember
that for my Biography!" he said to me gravely on
twelfth-day in 1849, after telling me what he had done
the night before; and as gravely I now redeem my
laughing promise that I would. Little Mary and her
sister Kate had taken much pains to teach their father
the polka, that he might dance it with them at their
brother's birthday festivity (held this year on the 7th,
as the 6th was a Sunday); and in the middle of the
previous night as he lay in bed, the fear had fallen on
him suddenly that the step was forgotten, and then
and there, in that wintry dark cold night, he got out
of bed to practise it. Anything <i>more</i> characteristic
could certainly not be told; unless I could have
shown him dancing it afterwards, and far excelling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_472" id="Page_2_472">[472]</a></span>
the youngest performer in untiring vigour and vivacity.
There was no one who approached him on these occasions
excepting only our attached friend Captain
Marryat, who had a frantic delight in dancing, especially
with children, of whom and whose enjoyments
he was as fond as it became so thoroughly good
hearted a man to be. His name would have stood first
among those I have been recalling, as he was among
the first in Dickens's liking; but in the autumn of 1848
he had unexpectedly passed away. Other names however
still reproach me for omission as my memory goes
back. With Marryat's on the earliest page of this
volume stands that of Monckton Milnes, familiar with
Dickens over all the time it covers, and still more
prominent in Tavistock-house days when with Lady
Houghton he brought fresh claims to my friend's admiration
and regard. Of Bulwer Lytton's frequent presence
in all his houses, and of Dickens's admiration for
him as one of the supreme masters in his art, so unswerving
and so often publicly declared, it would be needless
again to speak. Nor shall I dwell upon his interchange
of hospitalities with distinguished men in the
two great professions so closely allied to literature
and its followers; Denmans, Pollocks, Campbells, and
Chittys; Watsons, Southwood Smiths, Lococks, and
Elliotsons. To Alfred Tennyson, through all the
friendly and familiar days I am describing, he gave
full allegiance and honoured welcome. Tom Taylor
was often with him; and there was a charm for him
I should find it difficult to exaggerate in Lord Dudley
Stuart's gentle yet noble character, his refined intelligence
and generous public life, expressed so perfectly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_473" id="Page_2_473">[473]</a></span>
in his chivalrous face. Incomplete indeed would be
the list if I did not add to it the frank and hearty Lord
Nugent, who had so much of his grandfather, Goldsmith's
friend, in his lettered tastes and jovial enjoyments.
Nor should I forget occasional days with dear
old Charles Kemble and one or other of his daughters;
with Alexander Dyce; and with Harness and his sister,
or his niece and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Archdale;
made especially pleasant by talk about great days of
the stage. It was something to hear Kemble on his
sister's Mrs. Beverley; or to see Harness and Dyce
exultant in recollecting her Volumnia. The enchantment
of the Mrs. Beverley, her brother would delightfully
illustrate by imitation of her manner of restraining
Beverley's intemperance to their only friend, "You
are too busy, sir!" when she quietly came down the
stage from a table at which she had seemed to be occupying
herself, laid her hand softly on her husband's
arm, and in a gentle half-whisper "No, not too busy;
mistaken perhaps; but&mdash;&mdash;" not only stayed his temper
but reminded him of obligations forgotten in
the heat of it. Up to where the tragic terror began,
our friend told us, there was nothing but this composed
domestic sweetness, expressed even in the simplicity
and neat arrangement of her dress, her cap with the
strait band, and her hair gathered up underneath; but
all changing when the passion <i>did</i> begin; one single
disordered lock escaping at the first outbreak, and, in
the final madness, all of it streaming dishevelled down
her beautiful face. Kemble made no secret of his belief
that his sister had the higher genius of the two;
but he spoke with rapture of "John's" Macbeth and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_474" id="Page_2_474">[474]</a></span>
parts of his Othello; comparing his "Farewell the
tranquil mind" to the running down of a clock, an
image which he did not know that Hazlitt had applied
to the delivery of "To-morrow and to-morrow," in the
other tragedy. In all this Harness seemed to agree;
and I thought a distinction was not ill put by him, on
the night of which I speak, in his remark that the nature
in Kemble's acting only supplemented his magnificent
art, whereas, though the artist was not less supreme
in his sister, it was on nature she most relied, bringing
up the other power only to the aid of it. "It was in
another sense like your writing," said Harness to Dickens,
"the commonest natural feelings made great, even
when not rendered more refined, by art." Her Constance
would have been fishwify, he declared, if its
wonderful truth had not overborne every other feeling;
and her Volumnia escaped being vulgar only by being so
excessively grand. But it was just what was so called
"vulgarity" that made its passionate appeal to the vulgar
in a better meaning of the word. When she first entered,
Harness said, swaying and surging from side to side with
every movement of the Roman crowd itself, as it went
out and returned in confusion, she so absorbed her son
into herself as she looked at him, so swelled and amplified
in her pride and glory for him, that "the people
in the pit blubbered all round," and he could no more
help it than the rest.</p>

<p>There are yet some other names that should have
place in these rambling recollections, though I by no
means affect to remember all. One Sunday evening
Mazzini made memorable by taking us to see the school
he had established in Clerkenwell for the Italian organ-boys.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_475" id="Page_2_475">[475]</a></span>
This was after dining with Dickens, who had
been brought into personal intercourse with the great
Italian by having given money to a begging impostor
who made unauthorized use of his name. Edinburgh
friends made him regular visits in the spring time: not
Jeffrey and his family alone, but sheriff Gordon and
his, with whom he was not less intimate, Lord Murray
and his wife, Sir William Allan and his niece, Lord
Robertson with his wonderful Scotch mimicries, and
Peter Fraser with his enchanting Scotch songs; our
excellent friend Liston the surgeon, until his fatal illness
came in December 1848, being seldom absent
from those assembled to bid such visitors welcome.
Allan's name may remind me of other artists often at
his house, Eastlakes, Leslies, Friths, and Wards, besides
those who have had frequent mention, and among
whom I should have included Charles as well as Edwin
Landseer, and William Boxall. Nor should I drop
from this section of his friends, than whom none were
more attractive to him, such celebrated names in the
sister arts as those of Miss Helen Faucit, an actress
worthily associated with the brightest days of our friend
Macready's managements, Mr. Sims Reeves, Mr. John
Parry, Mr. Phelps, Mr. Webster, Mr. Harley, Mr. and
Mrs. Keeley, Mr. Whitworth, and Miss Dolby. Mr.
George Henry Lewes he had an old and great regard
for; among other men of letters should not be forgotten
the cordial Thomas Ingoldsby, and many-sided
true-hearted Charles Knight; Mr. R. H. Horne and
his wife were frequent visitors both in London and at
seaside holidays; and I have met at his table Mr. and
Mrs. S. C. Hall. There were the Duff Gordons too,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_476" id="Page_2_476">[476]</a></span>
the Lyells, and, very old friends of us both, the Emerson
Tennents; there was the good George Raymond,
Mr. Frank Beard and his wife; the Porter Smiths,
valued for Macready's sake as well as their own; Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Black, near connections by marriage
of George Cattermole, with whom there was intimate
intercourse both before and during the residence in
Italy; Mr. Thompson, brother of Mrs. Smithson formerly
named, and his wife, whose sister Frederick
Dickens married; Mr. Mitton, his own early companion;
and Mrs. Torrens, who had played with the
amateurs in Canada. These are all in my memory so
connected with Devonshire-terrace, as friends or familiar
acquaintance, that they claim this word before
leaving it; and visitors from America, I may remark,
had always a grateful reception. Of the Bancrofts
mention has been made, and with them should be
coupled the Abbot Lawrences, Prescott, Hillard,
George Curtis, and Felton's brother. Felton himself
did not visit England until the Tavistock-house time.
In 1847 there was a delightful day with the Coldens
and the Wilkses, relatives by marriage of Jeffrey; in
the following year, I think at my rooms because of
some accident that closed Devonshire-terrace that day
(25th of April), Dickens, Carlyle, and myself foregathered
with the admirable Emerson; and M. Van de
Weyer will probably remember a dinner where he took
joyous part with Dickens in running down a phrase
which the learned in books, Mr. Cogswell, on a mission
here for the Astor library, had startled us by denouncing
as an uncouth Scotch barbarism&mdash;<i>open up</i>. You
found it constantly in Hume, he said, but hardly anywhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_477" id="Page_2_477">[477]</a></span>
else; and he defied us to find it more than once
through the whole of the volumes of Gibbon. Upon
this, after brief wonder and doubt, we all thought it
best to take part in a general assault upon <i>open up</i>, by
invention of phrases on the same plan that should show
it in exaggerated burlesque, and support Mr. Cogswell's
indictment. Then came a struggle who should carry
the absurdity farthest; and the victory remained with
M. Van de Weyer until Dickens surpassed even him,
and "opened up" depths of almost frenzied absurdity
that would have delighted the heart of Leigh Hunt. It
will introduce the last and not least honoured name
into my list of his acquaintance and friends, if I mention
his amusing little interruption one day to Professor
Owen's description of a telescope of huge dimensions
built by an enterprising clergyman who had
taken to the study of the stars; and who was eager,
said Owen, to see farther into heaven&mdash;he was going
to say, than Lord Rosse; if Dickens had not drily
interposed, "than his professional studies had enabled
him to penetrate."</p>

<p>Some incidents that belong specially to the three
years that closed his residence in the home thus associated
with not the least interesting part of his career,
will farther show what now were his occupations and
ways of life. In the summer of 1849 he came up from
Broadstairs to attend a Mansion-house dinner, which
the lord mayor of that day had been moved by a laudable
ambition to give to "literature and art," which
he supposed would be adequately represented by the
Royal Academy, the contributors to <i>Punch</i>, Dickens,
and one or two newspaper men. On the whole the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_478" id="Page_2_478">[478]</a></span>
result was not cheering; the worthy chief magistrate,
no doubt quite undesignedly, expressing too much surprise
at the unaccustomed faces around him to be altogether
complimentary. In general (this was the tone)
we are in the habit of having princes, dukes, ministers,
and what not for our guests, but what a delight, all the
greater for being unusual, to see gentlemen like you!
In other words, what could possibly be pleasanter than
for people satiated with greatness to get for a while by
way of change into the butler's pantry? This in substance
was Dickens's account to me next day, and his
reason for having been very careful in his acknowledgment
of the toast of "the Novelists." He was
nettled not a little therefore by a jesting allusion to
himself in the <i>Daily News</i> in connection with the
proceedings, and asked me to forward a remonstrance.
Having a strong dislike to all such displays of sensitiveness,
I suppressed the letter; but it is perhaps worth
printing now. Its date is Broadstairs, Wednesday 11th
of July 1849. "I have no other interest in, or concern
with, a most facetious article on last Saturday's dinner
at the Mansion-house, which appeared in your paper of
yesterday, and found its way here to-day, than that it
misrepresents me in what I said on the occasion. If you
should not think it at all damaging to the wit of that
satire to state what I did say, I shall be much obliged
to you. It was this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That I considered the compliment
of a recognition of Literature by the citizens of
London the more acceptable to us because it was unusual
in that hall, and likely to be an advantage and
benefit to them in proportion as it became in future
less unusual. That, on behalf of the novelists, I accepted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_479" id="Page_2_479">[479]</a></span>
the tribute as an appropriate one; inasmuch as
we had sometimes reason to hope that our imaginary
worlds afforded an occasional refuge to men busily engaged
in the toils of life, from which they came forth
none the worse to a renewal of its strivings; and certainly
that the chief magistrate of the greatest city in
the world might be fitly regarded as the representative
of that class of our readers."</p>

<p>Of an incident towards the close of the year, though
it had important practical results, brief mention will
here suffice. We saw the Mannings executed on the
walls of Horsemonger-lane gaol; and with the letter
which Dickens wrote next day to the <i>Times</i> descriptive
of what we had witnessed on that memorable morning,
there began an active agitation against public executions
which never ceased until the salutary change was
effected which has worked so well. Shortly after this
he visited Rockingham-castle, the seat of Mr. and Mrs.
Watson, his Lausanne friends; and I must preface by
a word or two the amusing letter in which he told me
of this visit. It was written in character, and the character
was that of an American visitor to England.</p>

<p>"I knew him, Horatio;" and a very kindly honest
man he was, who had come to England authorised to
make enquiry into our general agricultural condition,
and who discharged his mission by publishing some reports
extremely creditable to his good sense and ability,
expressed in a plain nervous English that reminded one
of the rural writings of Cobbett. But in an evil hour
he published also a series of private letters to friends
written from the various residences his introductions
had opened to him; and these were filled with revelations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_480" id="Page_2_480">[480]</a></span>
as to the internal economy of English noblemen's
country houses, of a highly startling description. As
for example, how, on arrival at a house your "name
is announced, and your portmanteau immediately
taken into your chamber, which the servant shows you,
with every convenience." How "you are asked by
the servant at breakfast what you will have, or you get
up and help yourself." How at dinner you don't dash
at the dishes, or contend for the "fixings," but wait
till "his portion is handed by servants to every one."
How all the wines, fruit, glasses, candlesticks, lamps,
and plate are "taken care of" by butlers, who have
under-butlers for their "adjuncts;" how ladies never
wear "white satin shoes or white gloves more than
once;" how dinner napkins are "never left upon the
table, but either thrown into your chair or on the floor
under the table;" how no end of pains are taken to
"empty slops;" and above all what a national propensity
there is to brush a man's clothes and polish his
boots, whensoever and wheresoever the clothes and
boots can be seized without the man.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> This was what
Dickens good-humouredly laughs at.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_481" id="Page_2_481">[481]</a></span></p>
<p>"Rockingham Castle: Friday, thirtieth of November,
1849. Picture to yourself, my dear F, a large old
castle, approached by an ancient keep, portcullis, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., filled with company, waited on by six-and-twenty
servants; the slops (and wine-glasses) continually being
emptied; and my clothes (with myself in them) always
being carried off to all sorts of places; and you will
have a faint idea of the mansion in which I am at
present staying. I should have written to you yesterday,
but for having had a very busy day. Among the
guests is a Miss B, sister of the Honourable Miss B
(of Salem, Mass.), whom we once met at the house of
our distinguished literary countryman Colonel Landor.
This lady is renowned as an amateur actress, so last
night we got up in the great hall some scenes from the
<i>School for Scandal;</i> the scene with the lunatic on the
wall, from the <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> of Major-General the
Hon. C. Dickens (Richmond, Va.); some conjuring;
and then finished off with country-dances; of which
we had two admirably good ones, quite new to me,
though really old. Getting the words, and making
the preparations, occupied (as you may believe) the
whole day; and it was three o'clock before I got to
bed. It was an excellent entertainment, and we were
all uncommonly merry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I had a very polite letter
from our enterprising countryman Major Bentley<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> (of
Lexington, Ky.), which I shall show you when I come
home. We leave here this afternoon, and I shall expect
you according to appointment, at a quarter past<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_482" id="Page_2_482">[482]</a></span>
ten <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> to-morrow. Of all the country-houses and
estates I have yet seen in England, I think this is by
far the best. Everything undertaken eventuates in a
most magnificent hospitality; and you will be pleased
to hear that our celebrated fellow citizen General Boxall
(Pittsburg, Penn.) is engaged in handing down to
posterity the face of the owner of the mansion and of
his youthful son and daughter. At a future time it
will be my duty to report on the turnips, mangel-wurzel,
ploughs, and live stock; and for the present
I will only say that I regard it as a fortunate circumstance
for the neighbouring community that this patrimony
should have fallen to my spirited and enlightened
host. Every one has profited by it, and the labouring
people in especial are thoroughly well cared-for and
looked after. To see all the household, headed by
an enormously fat housekeeper, occupying the back
benches last night, laughing and applauding without
any restraint; and to see a blushing sleek-headed footman
produce, for the watch-trick, a silver watch of
the most portentous dimensions, amidst the rapturous
delight of his brethren and sisterhood; was a very
pleasant spectacle, even to a conscientious republican
like yourself or me, who cannot but contemplate the
parent country with feelings of pride in our own land,
which (as was well observed by the Honorable Elias
Deeze, of Hertford, Conn.) is truly the land of the
free. Best remembrances from Columbia's daughters.
Ever thine, my dear F,&mdash;C.H." Dickens, during the
too brief time this excellent friend was spared to him,
often repeated his visits to Rockingham, always a surpassing
enjoyment; and in the winter of 1851 he accomplished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_483" id="Page_2_483">[483]</a></span>
there, with help of the country carpenter,
"a very elegant little theatre," of which he constituted
himself manager, and had among his actors a brother
of the lady referred to in his letter, "a very good
comic actor, but loose in words;" poor Augustus Stafford
"more than passable;" and "a son of Vernon
Smith's, really a capital low comedian." It will be
one more added to the many examples I have given
of his untiring energy both in work and play, if I
mention the fact that this theatre was opened at Rockingham
for their first representation on Wednesday the
15th of January; that after the performance there was
a country dance which lasted far into the morning;
and that on the next evening, after a railway journey
of more than 120 miles, he dined in London with the
prime minister, Lord John Russell.</p>

<p>A little earlier in that winter we had together taken
his eldest son to Eton, and a little later he had a great
sorrow. "Poor dear Jeffrey!" he wrote to me on the
29th January, 1850. "I bought a <i>Times</i> at the station
yesterday morning, and was so stunned by the announcement,
that I felt it in that wounded part of me,
almost directly; and the bad symptoms (modified)
returned within a few hours. I had a letter from him
in extraordinary good spirits within this week or two&mdash;he
was better, he said, than he had been for a long
time&mdash;and I sent him proof-sheets of the number only
last Wednesday. I say nothing of his wonderful abilities
and great career, but he was a most affectionate
and devoted friend to me; and though no man could
wish to live and die more happily, so old in years and
yet so young in faculties and sympathies, I am very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_484" id="Page_2_484">[484]</a></span>
very deeply grieved for his loss." He was justly entitled
to feel pride in being able so to word his tribute
of sorrowing affection. Jeffrey had completed with
consummate success, if ever man did, the work appointed
him in this world; and few, after a life of such
activities, have left a memory so unstained and pure.
But other and sharper sorrows awaited Dickens.</p>

<p>The chief occupation of the past and present year,
<i>David Copperfield</i>, will have a chapter to itself, and in
this may be touched but lightly. Once fairly in it, the
story bore him irresistibly along; certainly with less
trouble to himself in the composition, beyond that
ardent sympathy with the creatures of the fancy which
always made so absolutely real to him their sufferings
or sorrows; and he was probably never less harassed by
interruptions or breaks in his invention. His principal
hesitation occurred in connection with the child-wife
Dora, who had become a great favourite as he went
on; and it was shortly after her fate had been decided,
in the early autumn of 1850,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> but before she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_485" id="Page_2_485">[485]</a></span>
breathed her last, that a third daughter was born to
him, to whom he gave his dying little heroine's name.
On these and other points, without forestalling what
waits to be said of the composition of this fine story,
a few illustrative words from his letters will properly
find a place here. "<i>Copperfield</i> half done," he wrote
of the second number on the 6th of June. "I feel,
thank God, quite confident in the story. I have a move
in it ready for this month; another for next; and another
for the next." "I think it is necessary" (15th
of November) "to decide against the special pleader.
Your reasons quite suffice. I am not sure but that the
banking house might do. I will consider it in a walk."
"Banking business impracticable" (17th of November)
"on account of the confinement: which would
stop the story, I foresee. I have taken, for the present
at all events, the proctor. I am wonderfully in harness,
and nothing galls or frets." "<i>Copperfield</i> done" (20th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_486" id="Page_2_486">[486]</a></span>
of November) "after two days' very hard work indeed;
and I think a smashing number. His first dissipation
I hope will be found worthy of attention, as a
piece of grotesque truth." "I feel a great hope" (23rd
of January, 1850) "that I shall be remembered by
little Em'ly, a good many years to come." "I begin
to have my doubts of being able to join you" (20th
of February), "for <i>Copperfield</i> runs high, and must be
done to-morrow. But I'll do it if possible, and strain
every nerve. Some beautiful comic love, I hope, in
the number." "Still undecided about Dora" (7th of
May), "but <span class="smcap">must</span> decide to-day."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> "I have been"
(Tuesday, 20th of August) "very hard at work these
three days, and have still Dora to kill. But with good
luck, I may do it to-morrow. Obliged to go to Shepherd's-bush
to-day, and can consequently do little this
morning. Am eschewing all sorts of things that present
themselves to my fancy&mdash;coming in such crowds!"
"Work in a very decent state of advancement" (13th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_487" id="Page_2_487">[487]</a></span>
of August) "domesticity notwithstanding. I hope I
shall have a splendid number. I feel the story to its
minutest point." "Mrs. Micawber is still" (15th of
August), "I regret to say, in statu quo. Ever yours,
<span class="smcap">Wilkins Micawber</span>." The little girl was born the
next day, the 16th, and received the name of Dora
Annie. The most part of what remained of the year
was passed away from home.</p>

<p>The year following did not open with favourable
omen, both the child and its mother having severe
illness. The former rallied however, and "little Dora
is getting on bravely, thank God!" was his bulletin
of the early part of February. Soon after, it was
resolved to make trial of Great Malvern for Mrs.
Dickens; and lodgings were taken there in March,
Dickens and her sister accompanying her, and the
children being left in London. "It is a most beautiful
place," he wrote to me (15th of March). "O
Heaven, to meet the Cold Waterers (as I did this
morning when I went out for a shower-bath) dashing
down the hills, with severe expressions on their countenances,
like men doing matches and not exactly winning!
Then, a young lady in a grey polka going <i>up</i>
the hills, regardless of legs; and meeting a young gentleman
(a bad case, I should say) with a light black
silk cap on under his hat, and the pimples of I don't
know how many douches under that. Likewise an old
man who ran over a milk-child, rather than stop!&mdash;with
no neckcloth, on principle; and with his mouth
wide open, to catch the morning air." This was the
month, as we have seen, when the performances for the
Guild were in active preparation, and it was also the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_488" id="Page_2_488">[488]</a></span>
date of the farewell dinner to our friend Macready on
his quitting the stage. Dickens and myself came up
for it from Malvern, to which he returned the next
day; and from the spirited speech in which he gave
the health of the chairman at the dinner, I will add a
few words for the sake of the truth expressed in them.
"There is a popular prejudice, a kind of superstition,
that authors are not a particularly united body, and I
am afraid that this may contain half a grain or so of the
veracious. But of our chairman I have never in my
life made public mention without adding what I can
never repress, that in the path we both tread I have
uniformly found him to be, from the first, the most
generous of men; quick to encourage, slow to disparage,
and ever anxious to assert the order of which
he is so great an ornament. That we men of letters
are, or have been, invariably or inseparably attached
to each other, it may not be possible to say, formerly
or now; but there cannot now be, and there cannot
ever have been, among the followers of literature, a
man so entirely without the grudging little jealousies
that too often disparage its brightness, as Sir Edward
Bulwer Lytton." That was as richly merited as it is
happily said.</p>

<p>Dickens had to return to London after the middle
of March for business connected with a charitable
Home established at Shepherd's-bush by Miss Coutts,
in the benevolent hope of rescuing fallen women by
testing their fitness for emigration, of which future
mention will be made, and which largely and regularly
occupied his time for several years. On this
occasion his stay was prolonged by the illness of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_489" id="Page_2_489">[489]</a></span>
father. His health had been failing latterly, and
graver symptoms were now spoken of. "I saw my
poor father twice yesterday," he wrote to me on the
27th, "the second time between ten and eleven at night.
In the morning I thought him not so well. At night,
as well as any one in such a situation could be." Next
day he was so much better that his son went back to
Malvern, and even gave us grounds for hope that we
might yet have his presence in Hertfordshire to advise
on some questions connected with the comedy which
Sir Edward Lytton had written for the Guild. But
the end came suddenly. I returned from Knebworth
to London, supposing that some accident had detained
him at Malvern; and at my house this letter waited
me. "Devonshire-terrace, Monday, thirty-first of
March 1851.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My poor father died this morning
at five and twenty minutes to six. They had sent for
me to Malvern, but I passed John on the railway; for
I came up with the intention of hurrying down to
Bulwer Lytton's to-day before you should have left. I
arrived at eleven last night, and was in Keppel-street
at a quarter past eleven. But he did not know me, nor
any one. He began to sink at about noon yesterday,
and never rallied afterwards. I remained there until
he died&mdash;O so quietly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hardly know what to
do. I am going up to Highgate to get the ground.
Perhaps you may like to go, and I should like it if you
do. I will not leave here before two o'clock. I think
I must go down to Malvern again, at night, to know
what is to be done about the children's mourning; and
as you are returning to Bulwer's I should like to have
gone that way, if <i>Bradshaw</i> gave me any hope of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_490" id="Page_2_490">[490]</a></span>
doing it. I wish most particularly to see you, I needn't
say. I must not let myself be distracted by anything&mdash;and
God knows I have left a sad sight!&mdash;from the
scheme on which so much depends. Most part of the
alterations proposed I think good." Mr. John Dickens
was laid in Highgate Cemetery on the 5th of April;
and the stone placed over him by the son who has made
his name a famous one in England, bore tribute to his
"zealous, useful, cheerful spirit." What more is to be
said of him will be most becomingly said in speaking
of <i>David Copperfield</i>. While the book was in course
of being written, all that had been best in him came
more and more vividly back to its author's memory;
as time wore on, nothing else was remembered; and
five years before his own death, after using in one of
his letters to me a phrase rather out of the common
with him, this was added: "I find this looks like my
poor father, whom I regard as a better man the longer
I live."</p>

<p>He was at this time under promise to take the chair
at the General Theatrical Fund on the 14th of April.
Great efforts were made to relieve him from the promise;
but such special importance was attached to his
being present, and the Fund so sorely then required
help, that, no change of day being found possible for
the actors who desired to attend, he yielded to the
pressure put upon him; of which the result was to
throw upon me a sad responsibility. The reader will
understand why, even at this distance of time; my allusion
to it is brief.</p>

<p>The train from Malvern brought him up only five
minutes short of the hour appointed for the dinner, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_491" id="Page_2_491">[491]</a></span>
we first met that day at the London Tavern. I never
heard him to greater advantage than in the speech that
followed. His liking for this Fund was the fact of its not
confining its benefits to any special or exclusive body of
actors, but opening them generously to all; and he
gave a description of the kind of actor, going down to
the infinitesimally small, not omitted from such kind
help, which had a half-pathetic humour in it that makes
it charming still. "In our Fund," he said, "the word
exclusiveness is not known. We include every actor,
whether he be Hamlet or Benedict: the ghost, the
bandit, or the court physician; or, in his one person, the
whole king's army. He may do the light business, or
the heavy, or the comic, or the eccentric. He may be
the captain who courts the young lady, whose uncle
still unaccountably persists in dressing himself in a costume
one hundred years older than his time. Or he
may be the young lady's brother in the white gloves
and inexpressibles, whose duty in the family appears to
be to listen to the female members of it whenever they
sing, and to shake hands with everybody between all
the verses. Or he may be the baron who gives the
f&ecirc;te, and who sits uneasily on the sofa under a canopy
with the baroness while the f&ecirc;te is going on. Or he
may be the peasant at the f&ecirc;te who comes on the stage
to swell the drinking chorus, and who, it may be observed,
always turns his glass upside down before he
begins to drink out of it. Or he may be the clown
who takes away the doorstep of the house where the
evening party is going on. Or he may be the gentleman
who issues out of the house on the false alarm,
and is precipitated into the area. Or, if an actress,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_492" id="Page_2_492">[492]</a></span>
she may be the fairy who resides for ever in a revolving
star with an occasional visit to a bower or a palace.
Or again, if an actor, he may be the armed head of the
witch's cauldron; or even that extraordinary witch,
concerning whom I have observed in country places,
that he is much less like the notion formed from the
description of Hopkins than the Malcolm or Donalbain
of the previous scenes. This society, in short, says,
'Be you what you may, be you actor or actress, be your
path in your profession never so high or never so low,
never so haughty or never so humble, we offer you the
means of doing good to yourselves, and of doing good
to your brethren.'"</p>

<p>Half an hour before he rose to speak I had been
called out of the room. It was the servant from Devonshire-terrace
to tell me his child Dora was suddenly
dead. She had not been strong from her birth; but
there was just at this time no cause for special fear,
when unexpected convulsions came, and the frail little
life passed away. My decision had to be formed at
once; and I satisfied myself that it would be best to
permit his part of the proceedings to close before the
truth was told to him. But as he went on, after the
sentences I have quoted, to speak of actors having to
come from scenes of sickness, of suffering, aye, even of
death itself, to play their parts before us, my part was
very difficult. "Yet how often is it with all of us,"
he proceeded to say, and I remember to this hour with
what anguish I listened to words that had for myself
alone, in all the crowded room, their full significance:
"how often is it with all of us, that in our several
spheres we have to do violence to our feelings, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_493" id="Page_2_493">[493]</a></span>
hide our hearts in carrying on this fight of life, if we
would bravely discharge in it our duties and responsibilities."
In the disclosure that followed when he left
the chair, Mr. Lemon, who was present, assisted me;
and I left this good friend with him next day, when
I went myself to Malvern and brought back Mrs. Dickens
and her sister. The little child lies in a grave at
Highgate near that of Mr. and Mrs. John Dickens;
and on the stone which covers her is now written also
her father's name, and those of two of her brothers.</p>

<p>One more public discussion he took part in, before
quitting London for the rest of the summer; and what
he said (it was a meeting, with Lord Carlisle in the
chair, in aid of Sanitary reform) very pregnantly illustrates
what was remarked by me on a former page. He
declared his belief that neither education nor religion
could do anything really useful in social improvement
until the way had been paved for their ministrations by
cleanliness and decency. He spoke warmly of the
services of Lord Ashley in connection with ragged
schools, but he put the case of a miserable child
tempted into one of those schools out of the noisome
places in which his life was passed, and he asked what
a few hours' teaching could effect against the ever-renewed
lesson of a whole existence. "But give him,
and his, a glimpse of heaven through a little of its
light and air; give them water; help them to be clean;
lighten the heavy atmosphere in which their spirits flag,
and which makes them the callous things they are;
take the body of the dead relative from the room
where the living live with it, and where such loathsome
familiarity deprives death itself of awe; and then, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2_494" id="Page_2_494">[494]</a></span>
not before, they will be brought willingly to hear of
Him whose thoughts were so much with the wretched,
and who had compassion for all human sorrow." He
closed by proposing Lord Ashley's health as having
preferred the higher ambition of labouring for the poor
to that of pursuing the career open to him in the service
of the State; and as having also had "the courage
on all occasions to face the cant which is the worst
and commonest of all, the cant about the cant of philanthropy."
Lord Shaftesbury first dined with him in
the following year at Tavistock-house.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Sanitary meeting came the first
Guild performances; and then Dickens left Devonshire-terrace,
never to return to it. What occupied him in
the interval before he took possession of his new abode,
has before been told; but two letters were overlooked
in describing his progress in the labour of the previous
year, and brief extracts from them will naturally lead
me to the subject of my next chapter. "I have been"
(15th of September) "tremendously at work these two
days; eight hours at a stretch yesterday, and six hours
and a half to-day, with the Ham and Steerforth chapter,
which has completely knocked me over&mdash;utterly
defeated me!" "I am" (21st of October) "within
three pages of the shore; and am strangely divided,
as usual in such cases, between sorrow and joy. Oh,
my dear Forster, if I were to say half of what <i>Copperfield</i>
makes me feel to-night, how strangely, even to
you, I should be turned inside out! I seem to be sending
some part of myself into the Shadowy World."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickens</span> never stood so high in reputation as at the
completion of <i>Copperfield</i>. The popularity it obtained
at the outset increased to a degree not approached by
any previous book excepting <i>Pickwick</i>. "You gratify
me more than I can tell you," he wrote to Bulwer Lytton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_22" id="Page_3_22">[22]</a></span>
(July 1850), "by what you say about <i>Copperfield</i>,
because I hope myself that some heretofore deficient
qualities are there." If the power was not greater than
in <i>Chuzzlewit</i>, the subject had more attractiveness; there
was more variety of incident, with a freer play of character;
and there was withal a suspicion, which though
general and vague had sharpened interest not a little,
that underneath the fiction lay something of the author's
life. How much, was not known by the world until he
had passed away.</p>

<p>To be acquainted with English literature is to know,
that, into its most famous prose fiction, autobiography
has entered largely in disguise, and that the characters
most familiar to us in the English novel had originals in
actual life. Smollett never wrote a story that was not
in some degree a recollection of his own adventures;
and Fielding, who put something of his wife into all his
heroines, had been as fortunate in finding, not Trulliber
only, but Parson Adams himself, among his living
experiences. To come later down, there was hardly
any one ever known to Scott of whom his memory had
not treasured up something to give minuter reality to
the people of his fancy; and we know exactly whom to
look for in Dandie Dinmont and Jonathan Oldbuck, in
the office of Alan Fairford and the sick room of Crystal
Croftangry. We are to observe also that it is never
anything complete that is thus taken from life by a genuine
writer, but only leading traits, or such as may give
greater finish; that the fine artist will embody in his
portraiture of one person his experiences of fifty; and
that this would have been Fielding's answer to Trulliber
if he had objected to the pigstye, and to Adams if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_23" id="Page_3_23">[23]</a></span>
he had sought to make a case of scandal out of the affair
in Mrs. Slipslop's bedroom. Such questioning befell
Dickens repeatedly in the course of his writings, where
he freely followed, as we have seen, the method thus
common to the masters in his art; but there was an
instance of alleged wrong in the course of <i>Copperfield</i>
where he felt his vindication to be hardly complete,
and what he did thereupon was characteristic.</p>

<p>"I have had the queerest adventure this morning,"
he wrote (28th of December 1849) on the eve of his
tenth number, "the receipt of the enclosed from Miss
Moucher! It is serio-comic, but there is no doubt one
is wrong in being tempted to such a use of power."
Thinking a grotesque little oddity among his acquaintance
to be safe from recognition, he had done what
Smollett did sometimes, but never Fielding, and given
way, in the first outburst of fun that had broken out
around the fancy, to the temptation of copying too
closely peculiarities of figure and face amounting in
effect to deformity. He was shocked at discovering
the pain he had given, and a copy is before me of the
assurances by way of reply which he at once sent to the
complainant. That he was grieved and surprised beyond
measure. That he had not intended her altogether.
That all his characters, being made up out of
many people, were composite, and never individual.
That the chair (for table) and other matters were undoubtedly
from her, but that other traits were not hers
at all; and that in Miss Moucher's "Ain't I volatile"
his friends had quite correctly recognized the favourite
utterance of a different person. That he felt nevertheless
he had done wrong, and would now do anything to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_24" id="Page_3_24">[24]</a></span>
repair it. That he had intended to employ the character
in an unpleasant way, but he would, whatever the
risk or inconvenience, change it all, so that nothing
but an agreeable impression should be left. The reader
will remember how this was managed, and that the
thirty-second chapter went far to undo what the twenty-second
had done.</p>

<p>A much earlier instance is the only one known to me
where a character in one of his books intended to be
odious was copied wholly from a living original. The
use of such material, never without danger, might have
been justifiable here if anywhere, and he had himself a
satisfaction in always admitting the identity of Mr.
Fang in <i>Oliver Twist</i> with Mr. Laing of Hatton-garden.
But the avowal of his purpose in that case, and
his mode of setting about it, mark strongly a difference
of procedure from that which, following great examples,
he adopted in his later books. An allusion to a common
friend in one of his letters of the present date&mdash;"A
dreadful thought occurs to me! how brilliant in a
book!"&mdash;expresses both the continued strength of his
temptations and the dread he had brought himself to
feel of immediately yielding to them; but he had no
such misgivings in the days of <i>Oliver Twist</i>. Wanting
an insolent and harsh police-magistrate, he bethought
him of an original ready to his hand in one of the
London offices; and instead of pursuing his later
method of giving a personal appearance that should in
some sort render difficult the identification of mental
peculiarities, he was only eager to get in the whole man
complete upon his page, figure and face as well as manners
and mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_25" id="Page_3_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>He wrote accordingly (from Doughty-street on the
3rd of June 1837) to Mr. Haines,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> a gentleman who
then had general supervision over the police reports
for the daily papers. "In my next number of <i>Oliver
Twist</i> I must have a magistrate; and, casting about for
a magistrate whose harshness and insolence would render
him a fit subject to be <i>shown up</i>, I have as a necessary
consequence stumbled upon Mr. Laing of Hatton-garden
celebrity. I know the man's character perfectly
well; but as it would be necessary to describe his personal
appearance also, I ought to have seen him, which
(fortunately or unfortunately as the case may be) I
have never done. In this dilemma it occurred to me
that perhaps I might under your auspices be smuggled
into the Hatton-garden office for a few moments some
morning. If you can further my object I shall be really
very greatly obliged to you." The opportunity was
found; the magistrate was brought up before the novelist;
and shortly after, on some fresh outbreak of intolerable
temper, the home-secretary found it an easy
and popular step to remove Mr. Laing from the bench.</p>

<p>This was a comfort to everybody, saving only the
principal person; but the instance was highly exceptional,
and it rarely indeed happens that to the
individual objection natural in every such case some
consideration should not be paid. In the book that
followed <i>Copperfield</i>, two characters appeared having
resemblances in manner and speech to two distinguished
writers too vivid to be mistaken by their personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_26" id="Page_3_26">[26]</a></span>
friends. To Lawrence Boythorn, under whom
Landor figured, no objection was made; but Harold
Skimpole, recognizable for Leigh Hunt, led to much
remark; the difference being, that ludicrous traits were
employed in the first to enrich without impairing an
attractive person in the tale, whereas to the last was
assigned a part in the plot which no fascinating foibles
or gaieties of speech could redeem from contempt.
Though a want of consideration was thus shown to the
friend whom the character would be likely to recall
to many readers, it is nevertheless very certain that the
intention of Dickens was not at first, or at any time,
an unkind one. He erred from thoughtlessness only.
What led him to the subject at all, he has himself
stated. Hunt's philosophy of moneyed obligations,
always, though loudly, half jocosely proclaimed, and
his ostentatious wilfulness in the humouring of that or
any other theme on which he cared for the time to
expatiate,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> had so often seemed to Dickens to be whimsical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_27" id="Page_3_27">[27]</a></span>
and attractive that, wanting an "airy quality" for
the man he invented, this of Hunt occurred to him;
and "partly for that reason, and partly, he has since
often grieved to think, for the pleasure it afforded to
find a delightful manner reproducing itself under his
hand, he yielded to the temptation of too often making
the character speak like his old friend." This apology
was made<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> after Hunt's death, and mentioned a revision
of the first sketch, so as to render it less like, at the
suggestion of two other friends of Hunt. The friends
were Procter (Barry Cornwall) and myself; the feeling
having been mine from the first that the likeness was
too like. Procter did not immediately think so, but a
little reflection brought him to that opinion. "You
will see from the enclosed," Dickens wrote (17th of
March 1852), "that Procter is much of my mind. I
will nevertheless go through the character again in the
course of the afternoon, and soften down words here
and there." But before the day closed Procter had
again written to him, and next morning this was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_28" id="Page_3_28">[28]</a></span>
result. "I have again gone over every part of it very
carefully, and I think I have made it much less like.
I have also changed Leonard to Harold. I have no
right to give Hunt pain, and I am so bent upon not
doing it that I wish you would look at all the proof
once more, and indicate any particular place in which
you feel it particularly like. Whereupon I will alter
that place."</p>

<p>Upon the whole the alterations were considerable,
but the radical wrong remained. The pleasant sparkling
airy talk, which could not be mistaken, identified
with odious qualities a friend only known to the writer
by attractive ones; and for this there was no excuse.
Perhaps the only person acquainted with the original
who failed to recognize the copy, was the original himself
(a common case); but good-natured friends in
time told Hunt everything, and painful explanations
followed, where nothing was possible to Dickens but
what amounted to a friendly evasion of the points really
at issue. The time for redress had gone. I yet well
remember with what eager earnestness, on one of these
occasions, he strove to set Hunt up again in his own
esteem. "Separate in your own mind," he said to
him, "what you see of yourself from what other people
tell you that they see. As it has given you so much
pain, I take it at its worst, and say I am deeply sorry,
and that I feel I did wrong in doing it. I should otherwise
have taken it at its best, and ridden off upon what
I strongly feel to be the truth, that there is nothing in
it that <i>should</i> have given you pain. Every one in
writing must speak from points of his experience, and
so I of mine with you: but when I have felt it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_29" id="Page_3_29">[29]</a></span>
going too close I stopped myself, and the most blotted
parts of my MS. are those in which I have been striving
hard to make the impression I was writing from, <i>un</i>like
you. The diary-writing I took from Haydon, not from
you. I now first learn from yourself that you ever set
anything to music, and I could not have copied <i>that</i>
from you. The character is not you, for there are traits
in it common to fifty thousand people besides, and I
did not fancy you would ever recognize it. Under
similar disguises my own father and mother are in my
books, and you might as well see your likeness in
Micawber." The distinction is that the foibles of Mr.
Micawber and of Mrs. Nickleby, however laughable,
make neither of them in speech or character less loveable;
and that this is not to be said of Skimpole's.
The kindly or unkindly impression makes all the difference
where liberties are taken with a friend; and even
this entirely favourable condition will not excuse the
practice to many, where near relatives are concerned.</p>

<p>For what formerly was said of the Micawber resemblances,
Dickens has been sharply criticized; and in
like manner it was thought objectionable in Scott that
for the closing scenes of Crystal Croftangry he should
have found the original of his fretful patient at the
death-bed of his own father. Lockhart, who tells us
this, adds with a sad significance that he himself lived
to see the curtain fall at Abbotsford upon even such
another scene. But to no purpose will such objections
still be made. All great novelists will continue to use
their experiences of nature and fact, whencesoever derivable;
and a remark made to Lockhart by Scott himself
suggests their vindication. "If a man will paint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_30" id="Page_3_30">[30]</a></span>
from nature, he will be most likely to interest and
amuse those who are daily looking at it."</p>

<p>The Micawber offence otherwise was not grave. We
have seen in what way Dickens was moved or inspired
by the rough lessons of his boyhood, and the groundwork
of the character was then undoubtedly laid; but
the rhetorical exuberance impressed itself upon him
later, and from this, as it expanded and developed in a
thousand amusing ways, the full-length figure took its
great charm. Better illustration of it could not perhaps
be given than by passages from letters of Dickens,
written long before Micawber was thought of, in which
this peculiarity of his father found frequent and always
agreeable expression. Several such have been given in
this work from time to time, and one or two more may
here be added. It is proper to preface them by saying
that no one could know the elder Dickens without
secretly liking him the better for these flourishes of
speech, which adapted themselves so readily to his
gloom as well as to his cheerfulness, that it was difficult
not to fancy they had helped him considerably in both,
and had rendered more tolerable to him, if also more
possible, the shade and sunshine of his chequered life.
"If you should have an opportunity <i>pendente lite</i>, as
my father would observe&mdash;indeed did on some memorable
ancient occasions when he informed me that the
ban-dogs would shortly have him at bay"&mdash;Dickens
wrote in December 1847. "I have a letter from my
father" (May 1841) "lamenting the fine weather, invoking
congenial tempests, and informing me that it will
not be possible for him to stay more than another year in
Devonshire, as he must then proceed to Paris to consolidate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_31" id="Page_3_31">[31]</a></span>
Augustus's French." "There has arrived,"
he writes from the Peschiere in September 1844, "a
characteristic letter for Kate from my father. He
dates it Manchester, and says he has reason to believe
that he will be in town with the pheasants, on or about
the first of October. He has been with Fanny in the
Isle of Man for nearly two months: finding there, as
he goes on to observe, troops of friends, and every
description of continental luxury at a cheap rate."
Describing in the same year the departure from Genoa
of an English physician and acquaintance, he adds:
"We are very sorry to lose the benefit of his advice&mdash;or,
as my father would say, to be deprived, to a certain
extent, of the concomitant advantages, whatever they
may be, resulting from his medical skill, such as it is,
and his professional attendance, in so far as it may be
so considered." Thus also it delighted Dickens to
remember that it was of one of his connections his
father wrote a celebrated sentence; "And I must express
my tendency to believe that his longevity is (to
say the least of it) extremely problematical:" and that
it was to another, who had been insisting somewhat
obtrusively on dissenting and nonconformist superiorities,
he addressed words which deserve to be no less
celebrated; "The Supreme Being must be an entirely
different individual from what I have every reason to
believe him to be, if He would care in the least for the
society of your relations." There was a laugh in the
enjoyment of all this, no doubt, but with it much personal
fondness; and the feeling of the creator of
Micawber as he thus humoured and remembered the
foibles of his original, found its counterpart in that of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_32" id="Page_3_32">[32]</a></span>
his readers for the creation itself, as its part was played
out in the story. Nobody likes Micawber less for his
follies; and Dickens liked his father more, the more
he recalled his whimsical qualities. "The longer I
live, the better man I think him," he exclaimed afterwards.
The fact and the fancy had united whatever
was most grateful to him in both.</p>

<p>It is a tribute to the generally healthful and manly
tone of the story of <i>Copperfield</i> that such should be the
outcome of the eccentricities of this leading personage
in it; and the superiority in this respect of Micawber
over Skimpole is one of many indications of the inferiority
of <i>Bleak House</i> to its predecessor. With leading
resemblances that make it difficult to say which
character best represents the principle or no principle
of impecuniosity, there cannot be any doubt which
has the advantage in moral and intellectual development.
It is genuine humour against personal satire.
Between the worldly circumstances of the two, there
is nothing to choose; but as to everything else it is the
difference between shabbiness and greatness. Skimpole's
sunny talk might be expected to please as much
as Micawber's gorgeous speech, the design of both
being to take the edge off poverty. But in the one
we have no relief from attendant meanness or distress,
and we drop down from the airiest fancies into sordidness
and pain; whereas in the other nothing pitiful or
merely selfish ever touches us. At its lowest depth of
what is worst, we never doubt that something better
must turn up; and of a man who sells his bedstead
that he may entertain his friend, we altogether refuse
to think nothing but badly. This is throughout the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_33" id="Page_3_33">[33]</a></span>
free and cheery style of <i>Copperfield</i>. The masterpieces
of Dickens's humour are not in it; but he has nowhere
given such variety of play to his invention, and the
book is unapproached among his writings for its completeness
of effect and uniform pleasantness of tone.</p>

<p>What has to be said hereafter of those writings generally,
will properly restrict what is said here, as in
previous instances, mainly to personal illustration.
The <i>Copperfield</i> disclosures formerly made will for ever
connect the book with the author's individual story;
but too much has been assumed, from those revelations,
of a full identity of Dickens with his hero, and of a
supposed intention that his own character as well as
parts of his career should be expressed in the narrative.
It is right to warn the reader as to this. He can judge
for himself how far the childish experiences are likely
to have given the turn to Dickens's genius; whether
their bitterness had so burnt into his nature, as, in the
hatred of oppression, the revolt against abuse of power,
and the war with injustice under every form displayed
in his earliest books, to have reproduced itself only;
and to what extent mere compassion for his own childhood
may account for the strange fascination always
exerted over him by child-suffering and sorrow. But,
many as are the resemblances in Copperfield's adventures
to portions of those of Dickens, and often as
reflections occur to David which no one intimate with
Dickens could fail to recognize as but the reproduction
of his, it would be the greatest mistake to imagine
anything like a complete identity of the fictitious
novelist with the real one, beyond the Hungerford
scenes; or to suppose that the youth, who then received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_34" id="Page_3_34">[34]</a></span>
his first harsh schooling in life, came out of it as little
harmed or hardened as David did. The language of
the fiction reflects only faintly the narrative of the
actual fact; and the man whose character it helped to
form was expressed not less faintly in the impulsive
impressionable youth, incapable of resisting the leading
of others, and only disciplined into self-control by
the later griefs of his entrance into manhood. Here
was but another proof how thoroughly Dickens understood
his calling, and that to weave fact with fiction
unskilfully would be only to make truth less true.</p>

<p>The character of the hero of the novel finds indeed
his right place in the story he is supposed to tell,
rather by unlikeness than by likeness to Dickens, even
where intentional resemblance might seem to be prominent.
Take autobiography as a design to show that
any man's life may be as a mirror of existence to all
men, and the individual career becomes altogether
secondary to the variety of experiences received and
rendered back in it. This particular form in imaginative
literature has too often led to the indulgence of
mental analysis, metaphysics, and sentiment, all in
excess: but Dickens was carried safely over these
allurements by a healthy judgment and sleepless creative
fancy; and even the method of his narrative is
more simple here than it generally is in his books.
His imaginative growths have less luxuriance of underwood,
and the crowds of external images always rising
so vividly before him are more within control.</p>

<p>Consider Copperfield thus in his proper place in the
story, and sequence as well as connection will be given
to the varieties of its childish adventure. The first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_35" id="Page_3_35">[35]</a></span>
warm nest of love in which his vain fond mother, and
her quaint kind servant, cherish him; the quick-following
contrast of hard dependence and servile treatment;
the escape from that premature and dwarfed maturity
by natural relapse into a more perfect childhood; the
then leisurely growth of emotions and faculties into
manhood; these are component parts of a character
consistently drawn. The sum of its achievement is to
be a successful cultivation of letters; and often as such
imaginary discipline has been the theme of fiction,
there are not many happier conceptions of it. The
ideal and real parts of the boy's nature receive development
in the proportions which contribute best to the
end desired; the readiness for impulsive attachments
that had put him into the leading of others, has underneath
it a base of truthfulness on which at last he rests
in safety; the practical man is the outcome of the
fanciful youth; and a more than equivalent for the
graces of his visionary days, is found in the active
sympathies that life has opened to him. Many experiences
have come within its range, and his heart has
had room for all. Our interest in him cannot but be
increased by knowing how much he expresses of what
the author had himself gone through; but David includes
far less than this, and infinitely more.</p>

<p>That the incidents arise easily, and to the very end
connect themselves naturally and unobtrusively with
the characters of which they are a part, is to be said
perhaps more truly of this than of any other of Dickens's
novels. There is a profusion of distinct and distinguishable
people, and a prodigal wealth of detail;
but unity of drift or purpose is apparent always, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_36" id="Page_3_36">[36]</a></span>
the tone is uniformly right. By the course of the events
we learn the value of self-denial and patience, quiet
endurance of unavoidable ills, strenuous effort against
ills remediable; and everything in the fortunes of the
actors warns us, to strengthen our generous emotions
and to guard the purities of home. It is easy thus to
account for the supreme popularity of <i>Copperfield</i>, without
the addition that it can hardly have had a reader,
man or lad, who did not discover that he was something
of a Copperfield himself. Childhood and youth
live again for all of us in its marvellous boy-experiences.
Mr. Micawber's presence must not prevent my saying
that it does not take the lead of the other novels in
humorous creation; but in the use of humour to bring
out prominently the ludicrous in any object or incident
without excluding or weakening its most enchanting
sentiment, it stands decidedly first. It is the perfection
of English mirth. We are apt to resent the exhibition
of too much goodness, but it is here so qualified
by oddity as to become not merely palatable but attractive;
and even pathos is heightened by what in
other hands would only make it comical. That there
are also faults in the book is certain, but none that are
incompatible with the most masterly qualities; and a
book becomes everlasting by the fact, not that faults
are not in it, but that genius nevertheless is there.</p>

<p>Of its method, and its author's generally, in the delineation
of character, something will have to be said
on a later page. The author's own favourite people in
it, I think, were the Peggotty group; and perhaps he
was not far wrong. It has been their fate, as with all
the leading figures of his invention, to pass their names<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_37" id="Page_3_37">[37]</a></span>
into the language, and become types; and he has nowhere
given happier embodiment to that purity of
homely goodness, which, by the kindly and all-reconciling
influences of humour, may exalt into comeliness
and even grandeur the clumsiest forms of humanity.
What has been indicated in the style of the book as its
greatest charm is here felt most strongly. The ludicrous
so helps the pathos, and the humour so uplifts
and refines the sentiment, that mere rude affection and
simple manliness in these Yarmouth boatmen, passed
through the fires of unmerited suffering and heroic endurance,
take forms half-chivalrous half-sublime. It is
one of the cants of critical superiority to make supercilious
mention of the serious passages in this great
writer; but the storm and shipwreck at the close of
<i>Copperfield</i>, when the body of the seducer is flung dead
upon the shore amid the ruins of the home he has wasted
and by the side of the man whose heart he has broken,
the one as unconscious of what he had failed to reach
as the other of what he has perished to save, is a description
that may compare with the most impressive
in the language. There are other people drawn into
this catastrophe who are among the failures of natural
delineation in the book. But though Miss Dartle is
curiously unpleasant, there are some natural traits in her
(which Dickens's least life-like people are never without);
and it was from one of his lady friends, very
familiar to him indeed, he copied her peculiarity of
never saying anything outright, but hinting it merely,
and making more of it that way. Of Mrs. Steerforth
it may also be worth remembering that Thackeray had
something of a fondness for her. "I knew how it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_38" id="Page_3_38">[38]</a></span>
would be when I began," says a pleasant letter all
about himself written immediately after she appeared
in the story. "My letters to my mother are like this,
but then she likes 'em&mdash;like Mrs. Steerforth: don't you
like Mrs. Steerforth?"</p>

<p>Turning to another group there is another elderly lady
to be liked without a shadow of misgiving; abrupt, angular,
extravagant, but the very soul of magnanimity
and rectitude; a character thoroughly made out in all
its parts; a gnarled and knotted piece of female timber,
sound to the core; a woman Captain Shandy would have
loved for her startling oddities, and who is linked to the
gentlest of her sex by perfect womanhood. Dickens has
done nothing better, for solidness and truth all round,
than Betsey Trotwood. It is one of her oddities to
have a fool for a companion; but this is one of them
that has also most pertinence and wisdom. By a line
thrown out in <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>, that the true way of
treating the insane was, in all respects possible, to act
to them as if they were sane, Goethe anticipated what
it took a century to apply to the most terrible disorder
of humanity; and what Mrs. Trotwood does for Mr.
Dick goes a step farther, by showing how often asylums
might be dispensed with, and how large might be the
number of deficient intellects manageable with patience
in their own homes. Characters hardly less distinguishable
for truth as well as oddity are the kind old nurse
and her husband the carrier, whose vicissitudes alike of
love and of mortality are condensed into the three words
since become part of universal speech, <i>Barkis is willin'</i>.
There is wholesome satire of much utility in the conversion
of the brutal schoolmaster of the earlier scenes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_39" id="Page_3_39">[39]</a></span>
into the tender Middlesex magistrate at the close. Nor
is the humour anywhere more subtle than in the country
undertaker, who makes up in fullness of heart for scantness
of breath, and has so little of the vampire propensity
of the town undertaker in <i>Chuzzlewit</i>, that he dares
not even inquire after friends who are ill for fear of
unkindly misconstruction. The test of a master in
creative fiction, according to Hazlitt, is less in contrasting
characters that are unlike than in distinguishing
those that are like; and to many examples of the art in
Dickens, such as the Shepherd and Chadband, Creakle
and Squeers, Charley Bates and the Dodger, the Guppys
and the Wemmicks, Mr. Jaggers and Mr. Vholes,
Sampson Brass and Conversation Kenge, Jack Bunsby,
Captain Cuttle, and Bill Barley, the Perkers and Pells,
the Dodsons and Fogs, Sarah Gamp and Betsy Prig,
and a host of others, is to be added the nicety of distinction
between those eminent furnishers of funerals,
Mr. Mould and Messrs. Omer and Joram. All the
mixed mirth and sadness of the story are skilfully
drawn into the handling of this portion of it; and,
amid wooings and preparations for weddings and
church-ringing bells for baptisms, the steadily-going
rat-tat of the hammer on the coffin is heard.</p>

<p>Of the heroines who divide so equally between them
the impulsive, easily swayed, not disloyal but sorely
distracted affections of the hero, the spoilt foolishness
and tenderness of the loving little child-wife, Dora, is
more attractive than the too unfailing wisdom and self-sacrificing
goodness of the angel-wife, Agnes. The
scenes of the courtship and housekeeping are matchless;
and the glimpses of Doctors' Commons, opening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_40" id="Page_3_40">[40]</a></span>
those views, by Mr. Spenlow, of man's vanity of expectation
and inconsistency of conduct in neglecting
the sacred duty of making a will, on which he largely
moralizes the day before he dies intestate, form a background
highly appropriate to David's domesticities.
This was among the reproductions of personal experience
in the book; but it was a sadder knowledge that
came with the conviction some years later, that David's
contrasts in his earliest married life between his happiness
enjoyed and his happiness once anticipated, the
"vague unhappy loss or want of something" of which
he so frequently complains, reflected also a personal
experience which had not been supplied in fact so successfully
as in fiction. (A closing word may perhaps be
allowed, to connect with Devonshire-terrace the last
book written there. On the page opposite is engraved
a drawing by Maclise of the house where so many of
Dickens's masterpieces were composed, done on the
first anniversary of the day when his daughter Kate was
born.)</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_41" id="Page_3_41">[41]</a></span>
<img src="images/image18_devonshire.png" width="600" height="370" alt="DEVONSHIRE TERRACE." title="DEVONSHIRE TERRACE." />
<span class="caption">DEVONSHIRE TERRACE.</span>
</div>
<p><i>Bleak House</i> followed <i>Copperfield</i>, which in some respects
it copied in the autobiographical form by means
of extracts from the personal relation of its heroine.
But the distinction between the narrative of David and
the diary of Esther, like that between Micawber and
Skimpole, marks the superiority of the first to its successor.
To represent a storyteller as giving the most
surprising vividness to manners, motives, and characters
of which we are to believe her, all the time, as artlessly
unconscious, as she is also entirely ignorant of the good
qualities in herself she is na&iuml;vely revealing in the story,
was a difficult enterprise, full of hazard in any case, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_42" id="Page_3_42">[42]</a></span>
worth success, and certainly not successful. Ingenuity
is more apparent than freshness, the invention is neither
easy nor unstrained, and though the old marvellous
power over the real is again abundantly manifest, there
is some alloy of the artificial. Nor can this be said of
Esther's relation without some general application to
the book of which it forms so large a part. The novel
is nevertheless, in the very important particular of construction,
perhaps the best thing done by Dickens.</p>



<p>In his later writings he had been assiduously cultivating
this essential of his art, and here he brought it
very nearly to perfection. Of the tendency of composing
a story piecemeal to induce greater concern for
the part than for the whole, he had been always conscious;
but I remember a remark also made by him to
the effect that to read a story in parts had no less a tendency
to prevent the reader's noticing how thoroughly a
work so presented might be calculated for perusal as a
whole. Look back from the last to the first page of the
present novel, and not even in the highest examples of
this kind of elaborate care will it be found, that event
leads more closely to event, or that the separate incidents
have been planned with a more studied consideration
of the bearing they are severally to have on the
general result. Nothing is introduced at random,
everything tends to the catastrophe, the various lines
of the plot converge and fit to its centre, and to the
larger interest all the rest is irresistibly drawn. The
heart of the story is a Chancery suit. On this the plot
hinges, and on incidents connected with it, trivial or
important, the passion and suffering turn exclusively.
Chance words, or the deeds of chance people, to appearance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_43" id="Page_3_43">[43]</a></span>
irrelevant, are found everywhere influencing
the course taken by a train of incidents of which the
issue is life or death, happiness or misery, to men and
women perfectly unknown to them, and to whom they
are unknown. Attorneys of all possible grades, law
clerks of every conceivable kind, the copyist, the law
stationer, the usurer, all sorts of money lenders, suitors
of every description, haunters of the Chancery court
and their victims, are for ever moving round about the
lives of the chief persons in the tale, and drawing them
on insensibly, but very certainly, to the issues that await
them. Even the fits of the little law-stationer's servant
help directly in the chain of small things that lead
indirectly to Lady Dedlock's death. One strong chain
of interest holds together Chesney Wold and its inmates,
Bleak House and the Jarndyce group, Chancery
with its sorry and sordid neighbourhood. The characters
multiply as the tale advances, but in each the
drift is the same. "There's no great odds betwixt my
noble and learned brother and myself," says the grotesque
proprietor of the rag and bottle shop under the
wall of Lincoln's-inn, "they call me Lord Chancellor
and my shop Chancery, and we both of us grub on in
a muddle." <i>Edax rerum</i> the motto of both, but with
a difference. Out of the lumber of the shop emerge
slowly some fragments of evidence by which the chief
actors in the story are sensibly affected, and to which
Chancery itself might have succumbed if its devouring
capacities had been less complete. But by the
time there is found among the lumber the will which
puts all to rights in the Jarndyce suit, it is found to be
too late to put anything to rights. The costs have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_44" id="Page_3_44">[44]</a></span>
swallowed up the estate, and there is an end of the
matter.</p>

<p>What in one sense is a merit however may in others
be a defect, and this book has suffered by the very completeness
with which its Chancery moral is worked out.
The didactic in Dickens's earlier novels derived its
strength from being merely incidental to interest of a
higher and more permanent kind, and not in a small
degree from the playful sportiveness and fancy that
lighted up its graver illustrations. Here it is of sterner
stuff, too little relieved, and all-pervading. The fog
so marvellously painted in the opening chapter has
hardly cleared away when there arises, in <i>Jarndyce</i> v.
<i>Jarndyce</i>, as bad an atmosphere to breathe in; and
thenceforward to the end, clinging round the people
of the story as they come or go, in dreary mist or in
heavy cloud, it is rarely absent. Dickens has himself
described his purpose to have been to dwell on the romantic
side of familiar things. But it is the romance of
discontent and misery, with a very restless dissatisfied
moral, and is too much brought about by agencies disagreeable
and sordid. The Guppys, Weevles, Snagsbys,
Chadbands, Krooks, and Smallweeds, even the Kenges,
Vholeses, and Tulkinghorns, are much too real to be
pleasant; and the necessity becomes urgent for the reliefs
and contrasts of a finer humanity. These last are
not wanting; yet it must be said that we hardly escape,
even with them, into the old freedom and freshness of
the author's imaginative worlds, and that the too conscious
unconsciousness of Esther flings something of a
shade on the radiant goodness of John Jarndyce himself.
Nevertheless there are very fine delineations in the story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_45" id="Page_3_45">[45]</a></span>
The crazed little Chancery lunatic, Miss Flite; the
loud-voiced tender-souled Chancery victim, Gridley;
the poor good-hearted youth Richard, broken up in life
and character by the suspense of the Chancery suit on
whose success he is to "begin the world," believing
himself to be saving money when he is stopped from
squandering it, and thinking that having saved it he
is entitled to fling it away; trooper George, with the
Bagnets and their household, where the most ludicrous
points are more forcible for the pathetic touches underlying
them; the Jellyby interior, and its philanthropic
strong-minded mistress, placid and smiling amid a
household muddle outmuddling Chancery itself; the
model of deportment, Turveydrop the elder, whose
relations to the young people, whom he so superbly
patronizes by being dependent on them for everything,
touch delightfully some subtle points of truth; the inscrutable
Tulkinghorn, and the immortal Bucket; all
these, and especially the last, have been added by this
book to the list of people more intimately and permanently
known to us than the scores of actual familiar
acquaintance whom we see around us living and dying.</p>

<p>But how do we know them? There are plenty to tell
us that it is by vividness of external observation rather
than by depth of imaginative insight, by tricks of manner
and phrase rather than by truth of character, by
manifestation outwardly rather than by what lies behind.
Another opportunity will present itself for some
remark on this kind of criticism, which has always had
a special pride in the subtlety of its differences from
what the world may have shown itself prone to admire.
"In my father's library," wrote Landor to Southey's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_46" id="Page_3_46">[46]</a></span>
daughter Edith, "was the <i>Critical Review</i> from its commencement;
and it would have taught me, if I could
not even at a very early age teach myself better, that
Fielding, Sterne, and Goldsmith were really worth
nothing." It is a style that will never be without cultivators,
and its frequent application to Dickens will
be shown hereafter. But in speaking of a book in
which some want of all the freshness of his genius first
became apparent, it would be wrong to omit to add
that his method of handling a character is as strongly
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'inpressed'">impressed</ins> on the better portions of it as on the best of
his writings. It is difficult to say when a peculiarity
becomes too grotesque, or an extravagance too farcical,
to be within the limits of art, for it is the truth of these
as of graver things that they exist in the world in just the
proportions and degree in which genius can discover
them. But no man had ever so surprising a faculty as
Dickens of becoming himself what he was representing;
and of entering into mental phases and processes so
absolutely, in conditions of life the most varied, as to
reproduce them completely in dialogue without need
of an explanatory word. (He only departed from this
method once, with a result which will then be pointed
out.) In speaking on a former page of the impression
of reality thus to a singular degree conveyed by him,
it was remarked that where characters so revealed themselves
the author's part in them was done; and in the
book under notice there is none, not excepting those
least attractive which apparently present only prominent
or salient qualities, in which it will not be found
that the characteristic feature embodied, or the main
idea personified, contains as certainly also some human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_47" id="Page_3_47">[47]</a></span>
truth universally applicable. To expound or discuss
his creations, to lay them psychologically bare, to
analyse their organisms, to subject to minute demonstration
their fibrous and other tissues, was not at all
Dickens's way. His genius was his fellow feeling with
his race; his mere personality was never the bound or
limit to his perceptions, however strongly sometimes it
might colour them; he never stopped to dissect or
anatomize his own work; but no man could better adjust
the outward and visible oddities in a delineation
to its inner and unchangeable veracities. The rough
estimates we form of character, if we have any truth of
perception, are on the whole correct: but men touch
and interfere with one another by the contact of their
extremes, and it may very often become necessarily the
main business of a novelist to display the salient points,
the sharp angles, or the prominences merely.</p>

<p>The pathetic parts of <i>Bleak House</i> do not live
largely in remembrance, but the deaths of Richard
and of Gridley, the wandering fancies of Miss Flite, and
the extremely touching way in which the gentleman-nature
of the pompous old baronet, Dedlock, asserts
itself under suffering, belong to a high order of writing.
There is another most affecting example, taking the
lead of the rest, in the poor street-sweeper Jo; which
has made perhaps as deep an impression as anything
in Dickens. "We have been reading <i>Bleak House</i>
aloud," the good Dean Ramsay wrote to me very
shortly before his death. "Surely it is one of his most
powerful and successful! What a triumph is Jo! Uncultured
nature is <i>there</i> indeed; the intimations of true
heart-feeling, the glimmerings of higher feeling, all are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_48" id="Page_3_48">[48]</a></span>
there; but everything still consistent and in harmony.
Wonderful is the genius that can show all this, yet keep
it only and really part of the character itself, low or
common as it may be, and use no morbid or fictitious
colouring. To my mind, nothing in the field of fiction
is to be found in English literature surpassing the death
of Jo!" What occurs at and after the inquest is as
worth remembering. Jo's evidence is rejected because
he cannot exactly say what will be done to him after
he is dead if he should tell a lie;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> but he manages to
say afterwards very exactly what the deceased while he
lived did to him. That one cold winter night, when
he was shivering in a doorway near his crossing, a man
turned to look at him, and came back, and, having
questioned him and found he had not a friend in the
world, said, "Neither have I. Not one!" and gave
him the price of a supper and a night's lodging. That
the man had often spoken to him since, and asked him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_49" id="Page_3_49">[49]</a></span>
if he slept of a night, and how he bore cold and hunger,
or if he ever wished to die; and would say in
passing "I am as poor as you to-day, Jo" when he had
no money, but when he had any would always give
some. "He wos wery good to me," says the boy,
wiping his eyes with his wretched sleeve. "Wen I see
him a-layin' so stritched out just now, I wished he
could have heerd me tell him so. He wos werry good to
me, he wos!" The inquest over, the body is flung into
a pestiferous churchyard in the next street, houses overlooking
it on every side, and a reeking little tunnel of
a court giving access to its iron gate. "With the
night, comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court,
to the outside of the iron gate. It holds the
gate with its hands, and looks in within the bars;
stands looking in, for a little while. It then, with an
old broom it carries, softly sweeps the step, and makes
the archway clean. It does so, very busily, and trimly;
looks in again, a little while; and so departs." These
are among the things in Dickens that cannot be forgotten;
and if <i>Bleak House</i> had many more faults
than have been found in it, such salt and savour as this
might freshen it for some generations.</p>

<p>The first intention was to have made Jo more prominent
in the story, and its earliest title was taken
from the tumbling tenements in Chancery, "Tom-all-Alone's,"
where he finds his wretched habitation; but
this was abandoned. On the other hand, Dickens was
encouraged and strengthened in his design of assailing
Chancery abuses and delays by receiving, a few days
after the appearance of his first number, a striking
pamphlet on the subject containing details so apposite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_50" id="Page_3_50">[50]</a></span>
that he took from them, without change in any material
point, the memorable case related in his fifteenth chapter.
Any one who examines the tract<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> will see how
exactly true is the reference to it made by Dickens in
his preface. "The case of Gridley is in no essential
altered from one of actual occurrence, made public by
a disinterested person who was professionally acquainted
with the whole of the monstrous wrong from beginning
to end." The suit, of which all particulars are given,
affected a single farm, in value not more than &pound;1200,
but all that its owner possessed in the world, against
which a bill had been filed for a &pound;300 legacy left in
the will bequeathing the farm. In reality there was
only one defendant, but in the bill, by the rule of the
Court, there were seventeen; and, after two years had
been occupied over the seventeen answers, everything
had to begin over again because an eighteenth had
been accidentally omitted. "What a mockery of
justice this is," says Mr. Challinor, "the facts speak
for themselves, and I can personally vouch for their
accuracy. The costs already incurred in reference to
this &pound;300 legacy are not less than from &pound;800 to &pound;900,
and the parties are no forwarder. Already near five
years have passed by, and the plaintiff would be glad
to give up his chance of the legacy if he could escape
from his liability to costs, while the defendants who
own the little farm left by the testator, have scarce any
other prospect before them than ruin."</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">David Copperfield</span></i> had been written, in Devonshire-terrace
for the most part, between the opening of
1849 and October 1850, its publication covering that
time; and its sale, which has since taken the lead
of all his books but <i>Pickwick</i>, never then exceeding
twenty-five thousand. But though it remained thus
steady for the time, the popularity of the book added
largely to the sale of its successor. <i>Bleak House</i> was
begun in his new abode of Tavistock House at the end
of November 1851; was carried on, amid the excitements
of the Guild performances, through the following
year; was finished at Boulogne in the August of
1853; and was dedicated to "his friends and companions
in the Guild of Literature and Art."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_52" id="Page_3_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>In March 1852 the first number appeared,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and its
sale was mentioned in the same letter from Tavistock
House (7th of March) which told of his troubles in
the story at its outset, and of other anxieties incident
to the common lot and inseparable equally from its joys
and sorrows, through which his life was passing at the
time. "My Highgate journey yesterday was a sad
one. Sad to think how all journeys tend that way. I
went up to the cemetery to look for a piece of ground.
In no hope of a Government bill,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and in a foolish
dislike to leaving the little child shut up in a vault
there, I think of pitching a tent under the sky.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Nothing has taken place here: but I believe, every
hour, that it must next hour. Wild ideas are upon me
of going to Paris&mdash;Rouen&mdash;Switzerland&mdash;somewhere&mdash;and
writing the remaining two-thirds of the next No.
aloft in some queer inn room. I have been hanging
over it, and have got restless. Want a change I think.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_53" id="Page_3_53">[53]</a></span>
Stupid. We were at 30,000 when I last heard.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
am sorry to say that after all kinds of evasions, I am
obliged to dine at Lansdowne House to-morrow. But
maybe the affair will come off to-night and give me an
excuse! I enclose proofs of No. 2. Browne has done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_54" id="Page_3_54">[54]</a></span>
Skimpole, and helped to make him singularly unlike
the great original. Look it over, and say what occurs
to you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Don't you think Mrs. Gaskell charming?
With one ill-considered thing that looks like a want of
natural perception, I think it masterly." His last
allusion is to the story by a delightful writer then
appearing in <i>Household Words;</i> and of the others it
only needs to say that the family affair which might
have excused his absence at the Lansdowne dinner did
not come off until four days later. On the 13th of
March his last child was born; and the boy, his
seventh son, bears his godfather's distinguished name,
Edward Bulwer Lytton.</p>

<p>The inability to "grind sparks out of his dull
blade," as he characterized his present labour at <i>Bleak
House</i>, still fretting him, he struck out a scheme for
Paris. "I could not get to Switzerland very well at
this time of year. The Jura would be covered with
snow. And if I went to Geneva I don't know where
I might <i>not</i> go to." It ended at last in a flight to
Dover; but he found time before he left, amid many
occupations and some anxieties, for a good-natured
journey to Walworth to see a youth rehearse who was
supposed to have talents for the stage, and he was able
to gladden Mr. Toole's friends by thinking favourably
of his chances of success. "I remember what I once
myself wanted in that way," he said, "and I should
like to serve him."</p>

<p>At one of the last dinners in Tavistock House before
his departure, Mr. Watson of Rockingham was present;
and he was hardly settled in Camden-crescent, Dover,
when he had news of the death of that excellent friend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_55" id="Page_3_55">[55]</a></span>
"Poor dear Watson! It was this day two weeks when
you rode with us and he dined with us. We all remarked
after he had gone how happy he seemed to
have got over his election troubles, and how cheerful
he was. He was full of Christmas plans for Rockingham,
and was very anxious that we should get up a
little French piece I had been telling him the plot of.
He went abroad next day to join Mrs. Watson and the
children at Homburg, and then go to Lausanne, where
they had taken a house for a month. He was seized
at Homburg with violent internal inflammation, and
died&mdash;without much pain&mdash;in four days.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was
so fond of him that I am sorry you didn't know him
better. I believe he was as thoroughly good and true
a man as ever lived; and I am sure I can have felt no
greater affection for him than he felt for me. When I
think of that bright house, and his fine simple honest
heart, both so open to me, the blank and loss are like
a dream." Other deaths followed. "Poor d'Orsay!"
he wrote after only seven days (8th of August). "It is
a tremendous consideration that friends should fall
around us in such awful numbers as we attain middle
life. What a field of battle it is!" Nor had another
month quite passed before he lost, in Mrs. Macready,
a very dear family friend. "Ah me! ah me!" he
wrote. "This tremendous sickle certainly does cut deep
into the surrounding corn, when one's own small blade
has ripened. But <i>this</i> is all a Dream, may be, and
death will wake us."</p>

<p>Able at last to settle to his work, he stayed in Dover
three months; and early in October, sending home his
family caravan, crossed to Boulogne to try it as a resort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_56" id="Page_3_56">[56]</a></span>
for seaside holiday. "I never saw a better instance of
our countrymen than this place. Because it is accessible
it is genteel to say it is of no character, quite English,
nothing continental about it, and so forth. It is
as quaint, picturesque, good a place as I know; the
boatmen and fishing-people quite a race apart, and some
of their villages as good as the fishing-villages on the
Mediterranean. The Haute Ville, with a walk all round
it on the ramparts, charming. The country walks, delightful.
It is the best mixture of town and country
(with sea air into the bargain) I ever saw; everything
cheap, everything good; and please God I shall be
writing on those said ramparts next July!"</p>

<p>Before the year closed, the time to which his publishing
arrangements with Messrs. Bradbury and Evans
were limited had expired, but at his suggestion the
fourth share in such books as he might write, which
they had now received for eight years, was continued
to them on the understanding that the publishers' percentage
should no longer be charged in the partnership
accounts, and with a power reserved to himself to withdraw
when he pleased. In the new year his first adventure
was an ovation in Birmingham, where a silver-gilt
salver and a diamond ring were presented to him, as
well for eloquent service specially rendered to the Institution,
as in general testimony of "varied literary
acquirements, genial philosophy, and high moral
teaching." A great banquet followed on Twelfth
Night, made memorable by an offer<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> to give a couple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_57" id="Page_3_57">[57]</a></span>
of readings from his books at the following Christmas,
in aid of the new Midland Institute. It might seem to
have been drawn from him as a grateful return for the
enthusiastic greeting of his entertainers, but it was in
his mind before he left London. It was his first formal
undertaking to read in public.</p>

<p>His eldest son had now left Eton, and, the boy's
wishes pointing at the time to a mercantile career, he
was sent to Leipzig for completion of his education.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
At this date it seemed to me that the overstrain of attempting
too much, brought upon him by the necessities
of his weekly periodical, became first apparent in
Dickens. Not unfrequently a complaint strange upon
his lips fell from him. "Hypochondriacal whisperings
tell me that I am rather overworked. The spring does
not seem to fly back again directly, as it always did
when I put my own work aside, and had nothing else
to do. Yet I have everything to keep me going with a
brave heart, Heaven knows!" Courage and hopefulness
he might well derive from the increasing sale of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_58" id="Page_3_58">[58]</a></span>
<i>Bleak House</i>, which had risen to nearly forty thousand;
but he could no longer bear easily what he carried so
lightly of old, and enjoyments with work were too
much for him. "What with <i>Bleak House</i>, and <i>Household
Words</i>, and <i>Child's History</i>" (he dictated from
week to week the papers which formed that little book,
and cannot be said to have quite hit the mark with it),
"and Miss Coutts's Home, and the invitations to feasts
and festivals, I really feel as if my head would split like
a fired shell if I remained here." He tried Brighton
first, but did not find it answer, and returned.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> A few
days of unalloyed enjoyment were afterwards given to
the visit of his excellent American friend Felton; and
on the 13th of June he was again in Boulogne, thanking
heaven for escape from a breakdown. "If I had substituted
anybody's knowledge of myself for my own,
and lingered in London, I never could have got
through."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_59" id="Page_3_59">[59]</a></span></p><p>What befell him in Boulogne will be given, with the
incidents of his second and third summer visits to the
place, on a later page. He completed, by the third
week of August, his novel of <i>Bleak House;</i> and it was
resolved to celebrate the event by a two months' trip
to Italy, in company with Mr. Wilkie Collins and Mr.
Augustus Egg. The start was to be made from Boulogne
in the middle of October, when he would send his
family home; and he described the intervening weeks
as a fearful "reaction and prostration of laziness" only
broken by the <i>Child's History</i>. At the end of September
he wrote: "I finished the little <i>History</i> yesterday,
and am trying to think of something for the Christmas
number. After which I shall knock off; having had
quite enough to do, small as it would have seemed to
me at any other time, since I finished <i>Bleak House</i>."
He added, a week before his departure: "I get letters
from Genoa and Lausanne as if I were going to stay in
each place at least a month. If I were to measure my
deserts by people's remembrance of me, I should be a
prodigy of intolerability. Have recovered my Italian,
which I had all but forgotten, and am one entire and
perfect chrysolite of idleness."</p>

<p>From this trip, of which the incidents have an interest
independent of my ordinary narrative, Dickens
was home again in the middle of December 1853, and
kept his promise to his Birmingham friends by reading
in their Town Hall his <i>Christmas Carol</i> on the 27th,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
and his <i>Cricket on the Hearth</i> on the 29th. The enthusiasm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_60" id="Page_3_60">[60]</a></span>
was great, and he consented to read his <i>Carol</i>
a second time, on Friday the 30th, if seats were reserved
for working men at prices within their means. The
result was an addition of between four and five hundred
pounds to the funds for establishment of the new Institute;
and a prettily worked flower-basket in silver,
presented to Mrs. Dickens, commemorated these first
public readings "to nearly six thousand people," and
the design they had generously helped. Other applications
then followed to such extent that limits to compliance
had to be put; and a letter of the 16th of May
1854 is one of many that express both the difficulty in
which he found himself, and his much desired expedient
for solving it. "The objection you suggest to paid
public lecturing does not strike me at all. It is worth
consideration, but I do not think there is anything in
it. On the contrary, if the lecturing would have any
motive power at all (like my poor father this, in the
sound!) I believe it would tend the other way. In the
Colchester matter I had already received a letter from
a Colchester magnate; to whom I had honestly replied
that I stood pledged to Christmas readings at Bradford<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
and at Reading, and could in no kind of reason do
more in the public way." The promise to the people
of Reading was for Talfourd's sake; the other was given
after the Birmingham nights, when an institute in Bradford
asked similar help, and offered a fee of fifty pounds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_61" id="Page_3_61">[61]</a></span>
At first this was entertained; but was abandoned, with
some reluctance, upon the argument that to become
publicly a reader must alter without improving his position
publicly as a writer, and that it was a change to be
justified only when the higher calling should have failed
of the old success. Thus yielding for the time, he
nevertheless soon found the question rising again with
the same importunity; his own position to it being
always that of a man assenting against his will that it
should rest in abeyance. But nothing farther was resolved
on yet. The readings mentioned came off as
promised, in aid of public objects;<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and besides others
two years later for the family of a friend, he had given
the like liberal help to institutes in Folkestone, Chatham,
and again in Birmingham, Peterborough, Sheffield,
Coventry, and Edinburgh, before the question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_62" id="Page_3_62">[62]</a></span>
settled itself finally in the announcement for paid
public readings issued by him in 1858.</p>

<p>Carrying memory back to his home in the first half
of 1854, there are few things that rise more pleasantly
in connection with it than the children's theatricals.
These began with the first Twelfth Night at Tavistock
House, and were renewed until the principal actors
ceased to be children. The best of the performances
were <i>Tom Thumb</i> and <i>Fortunio</i>, in '54 and '55; Dickens
now joining first in the revel, and Mr. Mark Lemon
bringing into it his own clever children and a very
mountain of child-pleasing fun in himself. Dickens
had become very intimate with him, and his merry
genial ways had given him unbounded popularity with
the "young 'uns," who had no such favourite as
"Uncle Mark." In Fielding's burlesque he was the
giantess Glumdalca, and Dickens was the ghost of
Gaffer Thumb; the names by which they respectively
appeared being the Infant Phenomenon and the Modern
Garrick. But the younger actors carried off the palm.
There was a Lord Grizzle, at whose ballad of Miss
Villikins, introduced by desire, Thackeray rolled off
his seat in a burst of laughter that became absurdly
contagious. Yet even this, with hardly less fun from
the Noodles, Doodles, and King Arthurs, was not so
good as the pretty, fantastic, comic grace of Dollalolla,
Huncamunca, and Tom. The girls wore steadily the
grave airs irresistible when put on by little children;
and an actor not out of his fourth year, who went
through the comic songs and the tragic exploits without
a wrong note or a victim unslain, represented the small
helmeted hero. He was in the bills as Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_63" id="Page_3_63">[63]</a></span>
bore in fact the name of the illustrious author whose
conception he embodied; and who certainly would
have hugged him for Tom's opening song, delivered in
the arms of Huncamunca, if he could have forgiven
the later master in his own craft for having composed
it afresh to the air of a ditty then wildly popular at the
"Coal Hole."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> The encores were frequent, and for
the most part the little fellow responded to them; but
the misplaced enthusiasm that took similar form at the
heroic intensity with which he stabbed Dollalolla, he
rebuked by going gravely on to the close. His Fortunio,
the next Twelfth Night, was not so great; yet
when, as a prelude to getting the better of the Dragon,
he adulterated his drink (Mr. Lemon played the Dragon)
with sherry, the sly relish with which he watched the
demoralization, by this means, of his formidable adversary
into a helpless imbecility, was perfect. Here
Dickens played the testy old Baron, and took advantage
of the excitement against the Czar raging in 1855 to
denounce him (in a song) as no other than own cousin
to the very Bear that Fortunio had gone forth to subdue.
He depicted him, in his desolation of autocracy, as the
Robinson Crusoe of absolute state, who had at his court
many a show-day and many a high-day, but hadn't in
all his dominions a Friday.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The bill, which attributed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_64" id="Page_3_64">[64]</a></span>
these interpolations to "the Dramatic Poet of the Establishment,"
deserves also mention for the fun of the
six large-lettered announcements which stood at the
head of it, and could not have been bettered by Mr.
Crummles himself. "Re-engagement of that irresistible
comedian" (the performer of Lord Grizzle) "Mr. Ainger!"
"Reappearance of Mr. H. who created so
powerful an impression last year!" "Return of Mr.
Charles Dickens Junior from his German engagements!"
"Engagement of Miss Kate, who declined the munificent
offers of the Management last season!" "Mr.
Pass&eacute;, Mr. Mudperiod, Mr. Measly Servile, and Mr.
Wilkini Collini!" "First appearance on any stage of
Mr. Plornishmaroontigoonter (who has been kept out
of bed at a vast expense)." The last performer mentioned<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
was yet at some distance from the third year
of his age. Dickens was Mr. Pass&eacute;.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_65" id="Page_3_65">[65]</a></span></p><p>Gravities were mixed with these gaieties. "I wish
you would look" (20th of January 1854) "at the enclosed
titles for the <i>H. W.</i> story, between this and two
o'clock or so, when I will call. It is my usual day, you
observe, on which I have jotted them down&mdash;Friday!
It seems to me that there are three very good ones
among them. I should like to know whether you hit
upon the same." On the paper enclosed was written:
1. According to Cocker. 2. Prove it. 3. Stubborn
Things. 4. Mr. Gradgrind's Facts. 5. The Grindstone.
6. Hard Times. 7. Two and Two are Four.
8. Something Tangible. 9. Our Hard-headed Friend.
10. Rust and Dust. 11. Simple Arithmetic. 12. A
Matter of Calculation. 13. A Mere Question of Figures.
14. The Gradgrind Philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The three
selected by me were 2, 6, and 11; the three that were
his own favourites were 6, 13, and 14; and as 6 had
been chosen by both, that title was taken.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_66" id="Page_3_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p>It was the first story written by him for <i>Household
Words;</i> and in the course of it the old troubles of the
<i>Clock</i> came back, with the difference that the greater
brevity of the weekly portions made it easier to write
them up to time, but much more difficult to get sufficient
interest into each. "The difficulty of the space," he
wrote after a few weeks' trial, "is <span class="smcap">crushing</span>. Nobody
can have an idea of it who has not had an experience
of patient fiction-writing with some elbow-room always,
and open places in perspective. In this form, with any
kind of regard to the current number, there is absolutely
no such thing." He went on, however; and,
of the two designs he started with, accomplished one
very perfectly and the other at least partially. He
more than doubled the circulation of his journal; and
he wrote a story which, though not among his best,
contains things as characteristic as any he has written.
I may not go as far as Mr. Ruskin in giving it a high
place; but to anything falling from that writer, however
one may differ from it, great respect is due, and
every word here said of Dickens's intention is in the
most strict sense just.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> "The essential value and truth
of Dickens's writings," he says, "have been unwisely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_67" id="Page_3_67">[67]</a></span>
lost sight of by many thoughtful persons, merely because
he presents his truth with some colour of caricature.
Unwisely, because Dickens's caricature, though often
gross, is never mistaken. Allowing for his manner of
telling them, the things he tells us are always true. I
wish that he could think it right to limit his brilliant
exaggeration to works written only for public amusement;
and when he takes up a subject of high national
importance, such as that which he handled in <i>Hard
Times</i>, that he would use severer and more accurate
analysis. The usefulness of that work (to my mind, in
several respects, the greatest he has written) is with
many persons seriously diminished, because Mr. Bounderby
is a dramatic monster, instead of a characteristic
example of a worldly master; and Stephen Blackpool
a dramatic perfection, instead of a characteristic example
of an honest workman. But let us not lose the use
of Dickens's wit and insight, because he chooses to
speak in a circle of stage fire. He is entirely right in
his main drift and purpose in every book he has written;
and all of them, but especially <i>Hard Times</i>, should be
studied with close and earnest care by persons interested
in social questions. They will find much that is partial,
and, because partial, apparently unjust; but if they examine
all the evidence on the other side, which Dickens
seems to overlook, it will appear, after all their trouble,
that his view was the finally right one, grossly and
sharply told."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The best points in it, out of the circle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_68" id="Page_3_68">[68]</a></span>
of stage fire (an expression of wider application to this
part of Dickens's life than its inventor supposed it to
be), were the sketches of the riding-circus people and
the Bounderby household; but it is a wise hint of Mr.
Ruskin's that there may be, in the drift of a story,
truths of sufficient importance to set against defects of
workmanship; and here they challenged wide attention.
You cannot train any one properly, unless you cultivate
the fancy, and allow fair scope to the affections. You
cannot govern men on a principle of averages; and to
buy in the cheapest and sell in the dearest market is
not the <i>summum bonum</i> of life. You cannot treat the
working man fairly unless, in dealing with his wrongs
and his delusions, you take equally into account the
simplicity and tenacity of his nature, arising partly
from limited knowledge, but more from honesty and
singleness of intention. Fiction cannot prove a case,
but it can express forcibly a righteous sentiment; and
this is here done unsparingly upon matters of universal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_69" id="Page_3_69">[69]</a></span>
concern. The book was finished at Boulogne in the
middle of July,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and is inscribed to Carlyle.</p>

<p>An American admirer accounted for the vivacity of
the circus-scenes by declaring that Dickens had "arranged
with the master of Astley's Circus to spend
many hours behind the scenes with the riders and
among the horses;" a thing just as likely as that he
went into training as a stroller to qualify for Mr.
Crummles in <i>Nickleby</i>. Such successes belonged to
the experiences of his youth; he had nothing to add to
what his marvellous observation had made familiar
from almost childish days; and the glimpses we get of
them in the <i>Sketches by Boz</i> are in these points as perfect
as anything his later experience could supply.
There was one thing nevertheless which the choice of
his subject made him anxious to verify while <i>Hard
Times</i> was in hand; and this was a strike in a manufacturing
town. He went to Preston to see one at the
end of January, and was somewhat disappointed. "I
am afraid I shall not be able to get much here. Except
the crowds at the street-corners reading the placards
pro and con; and the cold absence of smoke from the
mill-chimneys; there is very little in the streets to
make the town remarkable. I am told that the people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_70" id="Page_3_70">[70]</a></span>
'sit at home and mope.' The delegates with the
money from the neighbouring places come in to-day
to report the amounts they bring; and to-morrow the
people are paid. When I have seen both these ceremonies,
I shall return. It is a nasty place (I thought
it was a model town); and I am in the Bull Hotel,
before which some time ago the people assembled supposing
the masters to be here, and on demanding to
have them out were remonstrated with by the landlady
in person. I saw the account in an Italian paper, in
which it was stated that 'the populace then environed
the Palazzo Bull, until the padrona of the Palazzo
heroically appeared at one of the upper windows and
addressed them!' One can hardly conceive anything
less likely to be represented to an Italian mind by this
description, than the old, grubby, smoky, mean, intensely
formal red brick house with a narrow gateway
and a dingy yard, to which it applies. At the theatre
last night I saw <i>Hamlet</i>, and should have done better
to 'sit at home and mope' like the idle workmen. In
the last scene, Laertes on being asked how it was with
him replied (verbatim) 'Why, like a woodcock&mdash;on
account of my treachery.'" (29th Jan.)</p>

<p>The home incidents of the summer and autumn of
1855 may be mentioned briefly. It was a year of much
unsettled discontent with him, and upon return from a
short trip to Paris with Mr. Wilkie Collins, he flung
himself rather hotly into agitation with the administrative
reformers,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> and spoke at one of the great meetings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_71" id="Page_3_71">[71]</a></span>
in Drury-lane Theatre. In the following month (April)
he took occasion, even from the chair of the General
Theatrical Fund, to give renewed expression to political
dissatisfactions.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> In the summer he threw open to
many friends his Tavistock House Theatre, having secured
for its "lessee and manager Mr. Crummles;"
for its poet Mr. Wilkie Collins, in an "entirely new
and original domestic melodrama;" and for its scene-painter
"Mr. Stanfield, R.A."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> <i>The Lighthouse</i>, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_72" id="Page_3_72">[72]</a></span>
Mr. Wilkie Collins, was then produced, its actors being
Mr. Crummles the manager (Dickens in other words),
the Author of the play, Mr. Lemon and Mr. Egg, and
the manager's sister-in-law and eldest daughter. It
was followed by the Guild farce of <i>Mr. Nightingale's
Diary</i>, in which besides the performers named, and
Dickens in his old personation part, the manager's
youngest daughter and Mr. Frank Stone assisted. The
success was wonderful; and in the three delighted
audiences who crowded to what the bills described as
"the smallest theatre in the world," were not a few
of the notabilities of London. Mr. Carlyle compared
Dickens's wild picturesqueness in the old lighthouse
keeper to the famous figure in Nicholas Poussin's bacchanalian
dance in the National Gallery; and at one
of the joyous suppers that followed on each night of
the play, Lord Campbell told the company that he
had much rather have written <i>Pickwick</i> than be Chief
Justice of England and a peer of parliament.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Then came the beginning of <i>Nobody's Fault</i>, as
<i>Little Dorrit</i> continued to be called by him up to the
eve of its publication; a flight to Folkestone to help<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_73" id="Page_3_73">[73]</a></span>
his sluggish fancy; and his return to London in October
to preside at a dinner to Thackeray on his going
to lecture in America. It was a muster of more than
sixty admiring entertainers, and Dickens's speech gave
happy expression to the spirit that animated all, telling
Thackeray not alone how much his friendship was
prized by those present, and how proud they were of
his genius, but offering him in the name of the tens of
thousands absent who had never touched his hand or
seen his face, life-long thanks for the treasures of
mirth, wit, and wisdom within the yellow-covered
numbers of <i>Pendennis</i> and <i>Vanity Fair</i>. Peter Cunningham,
one of the sons of Allan, was secretary to
the banquet; and for many pleasures given to the subject
of this memoir, who had a hearty regard for him,
should have a few words to his memory.</p>

<p>His presence was always welcome to Dickens, and
indeed to all who knew him, for his relish of social life
was great, and something of his keen enjoyment could
not but be shared by his company. His geniality
would have carried with it a pleasurable glow even if it
had stood alone, and it was invigorated by very considerable
acquirements. He had some knowledge of
the works of eminent authors and artists; and he had
an eager interest in their lives and haunts, which he
had made the subject of minute and novel enquiry.
This store of knowledge gave substance to his talk, yet
never interrupted his buoyancy and pleasantry, because
only introduced when called for, and not made matter
of parade or display. But the happy combination of
qualities that rendered him a favourite companion, and
won him many friends, proved in the end injurious to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_74" id="Page_3_74">[74]</a></span>
himself. He had done much while young in certain
lines of investigation which he had made almost his
own, and there was every promise that, in the department
of biographical and literary research, he would
have produced much weightier works with advancing
years. This however was not to be. The fascinations
of good fellowship encroached more and more upon
literary pursuits, until he nearly abandoned his former
favourite studies, and sacrificed all the deeper purposes
of his life to the present temptation of a festive hour.
Then his health gave way, and he became lost to friends
as well as to literature. But the impression of the
bright and amiable intercourse of his better time survived,
and his old associates never ceased to think of
Peter Cunningham with regret and kindness.</p>

<p>Dickens went to Paris early in October, and at its
close was brought again to London by the sudden death
of a friend, much deplored by himself, and still more
so by a distinguished lady who had his loyal service at
all times. An incident before his return to France is
worth brief relation. He had sallied out for one of
his night walks, full of thoughts of his story, one wintery
rainy evening (the 8th of November), and "pulled
himself up," outside the door of Whitechapel Workhouse,
at a strange sight which arrested him there.
Against the dreary enclosure of the house were leaning,
in the midst of the downpouring rain and storm, what
seemed to be seven heaps of rags: "dumb, wet, silent
horrors" he described them, "sphinxes set up against
that dead wall, and no one likely to be at the pains of
solving them until the General Overthrow." He sent
in his card to the Master. Against him there was no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_75" id="Page_3_75">[75]</a></span>
ground of complaint; he gave prompt personal attention;
but the casual ward was full, and there was no
help. The rag-heaps were all girls, and Dickens gave
each a shilling. One girl, "twenty or so," had been
without food a day and night. "Look at me," she
said, as she clutched the shilling, and without thanks
shuffled off. So with the rest. There was not a single
"thank you." A crowd meanwhile, only less poor
than these objects of misery, had gathered round the
scene; but though they saw the seven shillings given
away they asked for no relief to themselves, they
recognized in their sad wild way the other greater
wretchedness, and made room in silence for Dickens
to walk on.</p>

<p>Not more tolerant of the way in which laws meant
to be most humane are too often administered in England,
he left in a day or two to resume his <i>Little Dorrit</i>
in Paris. But before his life there is described, some
sketches from his holiday trip to Italy with Mr. Wilkie
Collins and Mr. Augustus Egg, and from his three
summer visits to Boulogne, claim to themselves two
intervening chapters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first news of the three travellers was from Chamounix,
on the 20th of October; and in it there was
little made of the fatigue, and much of the enjoyment,
of their Swiss travel. Great attention and cleanliness
at the inns, very small windows and very bleak passages,
doors opening to wintery blasts, overhanging
eaves and external galleries, plenty of milk, honey,
cows, and goats, much singing towards sunset on
mountain sides, mountains almost too solemn to look
at&mdash;that was the picture of it, with the country everywhere
in one of its finest aspects, as winter began to
close in. They had started from Geneva the previous
morning at four, and in their day's travel Dickens had
again noticed what he spoke of formerly, the ill-favoured
look of the people in the valleys owing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_77" id="Page_3_77">[77]</a></span>
their hard and stern climate. "All the women were
like used-up men, and all the men like a sort of fagged
dogs. But the good, genuine, grateful Swiss recognition
of the commonest kind word&mdash;not too often
thrown to them by our countrymen&mdash;made them quite
radiant. I walked the greater part of the way, which
was like going up the Monument." On the day the
letter was written they had been up to the Mer de
Glace, finding it not so beautiful in colour as in summer,
but grander in its desolation; the green ice, like
the greater part of the ascent, being covered with snow.
"We were alarmingly near to a very dismal accident.
We were a train of four mules and two guides, going
along an immense height like a chimney-piece, with
sheer precipice below, when there came rolling from
above, with fearful velocity, a block of stone about the
size of one of the fountains in Trafalgar-square, which
Egg, the last of the party, had preceded by not a yard,
when it swept over the ledge, breaking away a tree,
and rolled and tumbled down into the valley. It had
been loosened by the heavy rains, or by some wood-cutters
afterwards reported to be above." The only
place new to Dickens was Berne: "a surprisingly picturesque
old Swiss town, with a view of the Alps from
the outside of it singularly beautiful in the morning
light." Everything else was familiar to him: though
at that winter season, when the inns were shutting up,
and all who could afford it were off to Geneva, most
things in the valley struck him with a new aspect.
From such of his old friends as he found at Lausanne,
where a day or two's rest was taken, he had the gladdest
of greetings; "and the wonderful manner in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_78" id="Page_3_78">[78]</a></span>
which they turned out in the wettest morning ever
beheld for a Godspeed down the Lake was really quite
pathetic."</p>

<p>He had found time to see again the deaf, dumb, and
blind youth at Mr. Haldimand's Institution who had
aroused so deep an interest in him seven years before,
but, in his brief present visit, the old associations
would not reawaken. "Tremendous efforts were made
by Hertzel to impress him with an idea of me, and
the associations belonging to me; but it seemed in my
eyes quite a failure, and I much doubt if he had the
least perception of his old acquaintance. According
to his custom, he went on muttering strange eager
sounds like Town and Down and Mown, but nothing
more. I left ten francs to be spent in cigars for my
old friend. If I had taken one with me, I think I
could, more successfully than his master, have established
my identity." The child similarly afflicted, the
little girl whom he saw at the same old time, had been
after some trial discharged as an idiot.</p>

<p>Before October closed, the travellers had reached
Genoa, having been thirty-one consecutive hours on the
road from Milan. They arrived in somewhat damaged
condition, and took up their lodging in the top rooms
of the Croce di Malta, "overlooking the port and sea
pleasantly and airily enough, but it was no joke to get
so high, and the apartment is rather vast and faded."
The warmth of personal greeting that here awaited
Dickens was given no less to the friends who accompanied
him, and though the reader may not share in
such private confidences as would show the sensation
created by his reappearance, and the jovial hours that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_79" id="Page_3_79">[79]</a></span>
were passed among old associates, he will perhaps be
interested to know how far the intervening years had
changed the aspect of things and places made pleasantly
familiar to us in his former letters. He wrote to his
sister-in-law that the old walks were pretty much the
same as ever except that there had been building behind
the Peschiere up the San Bartolomeo hill, and the
whole town towards San Pietro d'Arena had been quite
changed. The Bisagno looked just the same, stony just
then, having very little water in it; the vicoli were
fragrant with the same old flavour of "very rotten
cheese kept in very hot blankets;" and everywhere he
saw the mezzaro as of yore. The Jesuits' College in
the Strada Nuova was become, under the changed government,
the H&ocirc;tel de Ville, and a splendid caff&egrave; with
a terrace-garden had arisen between it and Palaviccini's
old palace. "Pal himself has gone to the dogs."
Another new and handsome caff&egrave; had been built in the
Piazza Carlo Felice, between the old one of the Bei
Arti and the Strada Carlo Felice; and the Teatro
Diurno had now stone galleries and seats, like an ancient
amphitheatre. "The beastly gate and guardhouse
in the Albaro road are still in their dear old beastly
state; and the whole of that road is just as it was.
The man without legs is still in the Strada Nuova; but
the beggars in general are all cleared off, and our old
one-arm'd Belisario made a sudden evaporation a year
or two ago. I am going to the Peschiere to-day."
To myself he described his former favourite abode as
converted into a girls' college; all the paintings of gods
and goddesses canvassed over, and the gardens gone to
ruin; "but O! what a wonderful place!" He observed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_80" id="Page_3_80">[80]</a></span>
an extraordinary increase everywhere else, since
he was last in the splendid city, of "life, growth, and
enterprise;" and he declared his old conviction to be
confirmed that for picturesque beauty and character
there was nothing in Italy, Venice excepted, "near
brilliant old Genoa."</p>

<p>The voyage thence to Naples, written from the latter
place, is too capital a description to be lost. The
steamer in which they embarked was "the new express
English ship," but they found her to be already more
than full of passengers from Marseilles (among them
an old friend, Sir Emerson Tennent, with his family),
and everything in confusion. There were no places at
the captain's table, dinner had to be taken on deck, no
berth or sleeping accommodation was available, and
heavy first-class fares had to be paid. Thus they made
their way to Leghorn, where worse awaited them. The
authorities proved to be not favourable to the "crack"
English-officered vessel (she had just been started for
the India mail); and her papers not being examined
in time, it was too late to steam away again that day,
and she had to lie all night long off the lighthouse.
"The scene on board beggars description. Ladies on
the tables; gentlemen under the tables; bed-room appliances
not usually beheld in public airing themselves
in positions where soup-tureens had been lately developing
themselves; and ladies and gentlemen lying indiscriminately
on the open deck, arranged like spoons
on a sideboard. No mattresses, no blankets, nothing.
Towards midnight attempts were made, by means of
awning and flags, to make this latter scene remotely
approach an Australian encampment; and we three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_81" id="Page_3_81">[81]</a></span>
(Collins, Egg, and self) lay together on the bare planks
covered with our coats. We were all gradually dozing
off, when a perfectly tropical rain fell, and in a moment
drowned the whole ship. The rest of the night we
passed upon the stairs, with an immense jumble of men
and women. When anybody came up for any purpose
we all fell down, and when anybody came down we all
fell up again. Still, the good-humour in the English
part of the passengers was quite extraordinary.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
There were excellent officers aboard, and, in the morning,
the first mate lent me his cabin to wash in&mdash;which
I afterwards lent to Egg and Collins. Then we, the
Emerson Tennents, the captain, the doctor, and the
second officer, went off on a jaunt together to Pisa, as
the ship was to lie all day at Leghorn. The captain
was a capital fellow, but I led him, facetiously, such a
life the whole day, that I got most things altered at
night. Emerson Tennent's son, with the greatest
amiability, insisted on turning out of his state-room for
me, and I got a good bed there. The store-room down
by the hold was opened for Collins and Egg; and they
slept with the moist sugar, the cheese in cut, the spices,
the cruets, the apples and pears, in a perfect chandler's
shop&mdash;in company with what a friend of ours would
call a hold gent, who had been so horribly wet through
over night that his condition frightened the authorities;
a cat; and the steward, who dozed in an arm-chair, and
all-night-long fell head foremost, once every five minutes,
on Egg, who slept on the counter or dresser.
Last night, I had the steward's own cabin, opening on
deck, all to myself. It had been previously occupied
by some desolate lady who went ashore at Civita Vecchia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_82" id="Page_3_82">[82]</a></span>
There was little or no sea, thank Heaven, all the
trip; but the rain was heavier than any I have ever
seen, and the lightning very constant and vivid. We
were, with the crew, some 200 people&mdash;provided with
boats, at the utmost stretch, for one hundred perhaps.
I could not help thinking what would happen if we met
with any accident: the crew being chiefly Maltese, and
evidently fellows who would cut off alone in the largest
boat, on the least alarm; the speed very high; and the
running, thro' all the narrow rocky channels. Thank
God, however, here we are."</p>

<p>A whimsical postscript closed the amusing narrative.
"We towed from Civita Vecchia the entire Greek
navy, I believe; consisting of a little brig of war with
no guns, fitted as a steamer, but disabled by having
burnt the bottoms of her boilers out, in her first run.
She was just big enough to carry the captain and a
crew of six or so: but the captain was so covered with
buttons and gold that there never would have been
room for him on board to put those valuables away, if
he hadn't worn them&mdash;which he consequently did, all
night. Whenever anything was wanted to be done, as
slackening the tow-rope or anything of that sort, our
officers roared at this miserable potentate, in violent
English, through a speaking trumpet; of which he
couldn't have understood a word in the most favourable
circumstances. So he did all the wrong things
first, and the right thing always last. The absence of
any knowledge of anything but English on the part of
the officers and stewards was most ridiculous. I met
an Italian gentleman on the cabin steps yesterday
morning, vainly endeavouring to explain that he wanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_83" id="Page_3_83">[83]</a></span>
a cup of tea for his sick wife. And when we were
coming out of the harbour at Genoa, and it was necessary
to order away that boat of music you remember,
the chief officer (called 'aft' for the purpose, as 'knowing
something of Italian') delivered himself in this
explicit and clear Italian to the principal performer&mdash;'Now
Signora, if you don't sheer off you'll be run
down, so you had better trice up that guitar of yours
and put about.'"</p>

<p>At Naples some days were passed very merrily;
going up Vesuvius and into the buried cities, with
Layard who had joined them, and with the Tennents.
Here a small adventure befell Dickens specially, in
itself extremely unimportant; but told by him with
delightful humour in a letter to his sister-in-law. The
old idle Frenchman, to whom all things are possible,
with his snuff-box and dusty umbrella, and all the delicate
and kindly observation, would have enchanted
Leigh Hunt, and made his way to the heart of Charles
Lamb. After mentioning Mr. Lowther, then English
charg&eacute; d'affaires in Naples, as a very agreeable fellow
who had been at the Rockingham play, he alludes to
a meeting at his house. "We had an exceedingly
pleasant dinner of eight, preparatory to which I was
near having the ridiculous adventure of not being able
to find the house and coming back dinnerless. I went
in an open carriage from the hotel in all state, and the
coachman to my surprise pulled up at the end of the
Chiaja. 'Behold the house,' says he, 'of Il Signor
Larthoor!'&mdash;at the same time pointing with his whip
into the seventh heaven where the early stars were
shining. 'But the Signor Larthorr,' says I, 'lives at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_84" id="Page_3_84">[84]</a></span>
Pausilippo.' 'It is true,' says the coachman (still
pointing to the evening star), 'but he lives high up
the Salita Sant' Antonio where no carriage ever yet
ascended, and that is the house' (evening star as aforesaid),
'and one must go on foot. Behold the Salita
Sant' Antonio!' I went up it, a mile and a half I
should think, I got into the strangest places among
the wildest Neapolitans; kitchens, washing-places,
archways, stables, vineyards; was baited by dogs, and
answered, in profoundly unintelligible language, from
behind lonely locked doors in cracked female voices,
quaking with fear; but could hear of no such Englishman,
nor any Englishman. Bye and bye, I came upon
a polenta-shop in the clouds, where an old Frenchman
with an umbrella like a faded tropical leaf (it had not
rained in Naples for six weeks) was staring at nothing
at all, with a snuff-box in his hand. To him I appealed,
concerning the Signor Larthoor. 'Sir,' said
he, with the sweetest politeness, 'can you speak
French?' 'Sir,' said I, 'a little.' 'Sir,' said he, 'I
presume the Signer Loothere'&mdash;you will observe that
he changed the name according to the custom of his
country&mdash;'is an Englishman?' I admitted that he
was the victim of circumstances and had that misfortune.
'Sir,' said he, 'one word more. <i>Has</i> he a
servant with a wooden leg?' 'Great heaven, sir,' said
I, 'how do I know? I should think not, but it is possible.'
'It is always,' said the Frenchman, 'possible.
Almost all the things of the world are always possible.'
'Sir,' said I&mdash;you may imagine my condition and dismal
sense of my own absurdity, by this time&mdash;'that is
true.' He then took an immense pinch of snuff<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_85" id="Page_3_85">[85]</a></span>
wiped the dust off his umbrella, led me to an arch
commanding a wonderful view of the Bay of Naples,
and pointed deep into the earth from which I had
mounted. 'Below there, near the lamp, one finds an
Englishman with a servant with a wooden leg. It is
always possible that he is the Signor Loothore.' I had
been asked at six o'clock, and it was now getting on
for seven. I went back in a state of perspiration and
misery not to be described, and without the faintest
hope of finding the spot. But as I was going farther
down to the lamp, I saw the strangest staircase up a
dark corner, with a man in a white waistcoat (evidently
hired) standing on the top of it fuming. I
dashed in at a venture, found it was the house, made
the most of the whole story, and achieved much popularity.
The best of it was that as nobody ever did
find the place, Lowther had put a servant at the bottom
of the Salita to wait 'for an English gentleman;' but
the servant (as he presently pleaded), deceived by the
moustache, had allowed the English gentleman to pass
unchallenged."</p>

<p>From Naples they went to Rome, where they found
Lockhart, "fearfully weak and broken, yet hopeful of
himself too" (he died the following year); smoked
and drank punch with David Roberts, then painting
everyday with Louis Haghe in St. Peter's; and took
the old walks. The Coliseum, Appian Way, and
Streets of Tombs, seemed desolate and grand as ever;
but generally, Dickens adds, "I discovered the Roman
antiquities to be <i>smaller</i> than my imagination in nine
years had made them. The Electric Telegraph now
goes like a sunbeam through the cruel old heart of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_86" id="Page_3_86">[86]</a></span>
Coliseum&mdash;a suggestive thing to think about, I fancied.
The Pantheon I thought even nobler than of yore."
The amusements were of course an attraction; and
nothing at the Opera amused the party of three English
more, than another party of four Americans who
sat behind them in the pit. "All the seats are numbered
arm-chairs, and you buy your number at the pay-place,
and go to it with the easiest direction on the
ticket itself. We were early, and the four places of
the Americans were on the next row behind us&mdash;all
together. After looking about them for some time,
and seeing the greater part of the seats empty (because
the audience generally wait in a caff&egrave; which is part of
the theatre), one of them said 'Waal I dunno&mdash;I expect
we aint no call to set so nigh to one another neither&mdash;will
you scatter Kernel, will you scatter sir?&mdash;' Upon
this the Kernel 'scattered' some twenty benches off;
and they distributed themselves (for no earthly reason
apparently but to get rid of one another) all over the
pit. As soon as the overture began, in came the audience
in a mass. Then the people who had got the
numbers into which they had 'scattered,' had to get
them out; and as they understood nothing that was
said to them, and could make no reply but 'A-mericani,'
you may imagine the number of cocked hats it
took to dislodge them. At last they were all got back
into their right places, except one. About an hour
afterwards when Moses (<i>Moses in Egypt</i> was the opera)
was invoking the darkness, and there was a dead
silence all over the house, unwonted sounds of disturbance
broke out from a distant corner of the pit, and
here and there a beard got up to look. 'What is it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_87" id="Page_3_87">[87]</a></span>
neow sir?' said one of the Americans to another;&mdash;'some
person seems to be getting along, again streeem.'
'Waal sir' he replied 'I dunno. But I xpect 'tis the
Kernel sir, a holdin on.' So it was. The Kernel
was ignominiously escorted back to his right place, not
in the least disconcerted, and in perfectly good spirits
and temper." The opera was excellently done, and the
price of the stalls one and threepence English. At
Milan, on the other hand, the Scala was fallen from its
old estate, dirty, gloomy, dull, and the performance
execrable.</p>

<p>Another theatre of the smallest pretension Dickens
sought out with avidity in Rome, and eagerly enjoyed.
He had heard it said in his old time in Genoa that the
finest Marionetti were here; and now, after great difficulty,
he discovered the company in a sort of stable
attached to a decayed palace. "It was a wet night,
and there was no audience but a party of French officers
and ourselves. We all sat together. I never saw
anything more amazing than the performance&mdash;altogether
only an hour long, but managed by as many
as ten people, for we saw them all go behind, at the
ringing of a bell. The saving of a young lady by a
good fairy from the machinations of an enchanter,
coupled with the comic business of her servant Pulcinella
(the Roman Punch) formed the plot of the first
piece. A scolding old peasant woman, who always
leaned forward to scold and put her hands in the
pockets of her apron, was incredibly natural. Pulcinella,
so airy, so merry, so life-like, so graceful, he
was irresistible. To see him carrying an umbrella over
his mistress's head in a storm, talking to a prodigious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_88" id="Page_3_88">[88]</a></span>
giant whom he met in the forest, and going to bed
with a pony, were things never to be forgotten. And
so delicate are the hands of the people who move them,
that every puppet was an Italian, and did exactly what
an Italian does. If he pointed at any object, if he
saluted anybody, if he laughed, if he cried, he did it
as never Englishman did it since Britain first at
Heaven's command arose&mdash;arose&mdash;arose, &amp;c. There
was a ballet afterwards, on the same scale, and we
really came away quite enchanted with the delicate
drollery of the thing. French officers more than
ditto."</p>

<p>Of the great enemy to the health of the now capital
of the kingdom of Italy, Dickens remarked in the same
letter. "I have been led into some curious speculations
by the existence and progress of the Malaria
about Rome. Isn't it very extraordinary to think of
its encroaching and encroaching on the Eternal City
as if it were commissioned to swallow it up. This year
it has been extremely bad, and has long outstayed its
usual time. Rome has been very unhealthy, and is not
free now. Few people care to be out at the bad times
of sunset and sunrise, and the streets are like a desert
at night. There is a church, a very little way outside
the walls, destroyed by fire some 16 or 18 years ago,
and now restored and re-created at an enormous expense.
It stands in a wilderness. For any human
creature who goes near it, or can sleep near it, after
nightfall, it might as well be at the bottom of the
uppermost cataract of the Nile. Along the whole extent
of the Pontine Marshes (which we came across the
other day), no creature in Adam's likeness lives, except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_89" id="Page_3_89">[89]</a></span>
the sallow people at the lonely posting-stations. I walk
out from the Coliseum through the Street of Tombs to
the ruins of the old Appian Way&mdash;pass no human being,
and see no human habitation but ruined houses from
which the people have fled, and where it is Death to
sleep: these houses being three miles outside a gate
of Rome at its farthest extent. Leaving Rome by the
opposite side, we travel for many many hours over the
dreary Campagna, shunned and avoided by all but the
wretched shepherds. Thirteen hours' good posting
brings us to Bolsena (I slept there once before), on the
margin of a stagnant lake whence the workpeople fly
as the sun goes down&mdash;where it is a risk to go; where
from a distance we saw a mist hang on the place; where,
in the inconceivably wretched inn, no window can be
opened; where our dinner was a pale ghost of a fish
with an oily omelette, and we slept in great mouldering
rooms tainted with ruined arches and heaps of dung&mdash;and
coming from which we saw no colour in the cheek
of man, woman, or child for another twenty miles.
Imagine this phantom knocking at the gates of Rome;
passing them; creeping along the streets; haunting the
aisles and pillars of the churches; year by year more
encroaching, and more impossible of avoidance."</p>

<p>From Rome they posted to Florence, reaching it in
three days and a half, on the morning of the 20th of
November; having then been out six weeks, with only
three days' rain; and in another week they were at
Venice. "The fine weather has accompanied us here,"
Dickens wrote on the 28th of November, "the place
of all others where it is necessary, and the city has
been a blaze of sunlight and blue sky (with an extremely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_90" id="Page_3_90">[90]</a></span>
clear cold air) ever since we have been in it. If you
could see it at this moment you would never forget it.
We live in the same house that I lived in nine years
ago, and have the same sitting-room&mdash;close to the
Bridge of Sighs and the Palace of the Doges. The
room is at the corner of the house, and there is a narrow
street of water running round the side: so that we have
the Grand Canal before the two front windows, and
this wild little street at the corner window: into which,
too, our three bedrooms look. We established a gondola
as soon as we arrived, and we slide out of the hall on
to the water twenty times a day. The gondoliers have
queer old customs that belong to their class, and some
are sufficiently disconcerting.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is a point of honour
with them, while they are engaged, to be always at your
disposal. Hence it is no use telling them they may go
home for an hour or two&mdash;for they won't go. They
roll themselves in shaggy capuccins, great coats with
hoods, and lie down on the stone or marble pavement
until they are wanted again. So that when I come in
or go out, on foot&mdash;which can be done from this house
for some miles, over little bridges and by narrow ways&mdash;I
usually walk over the principal of my vassals, whose
custom it is to snore immediately across the doorway.
Conceive the oddity of the most familiar things in this
place, from one instance: Last night we go downstairs
at half-past eight, step into the gondola, slide away on
the black water, ripple and plash swiftly along for a
mile or two, land at a broad flight of steps, and instantly
walk into the most brilliant and beautiful theatre
conceivable&mdash;all silver and blue, and precious little
fringes made of glittering prisms of glass. There we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_91" id="Page_3_91">[91]</a></span>
sit until half-past eleven, come out again (gondolier
asleep outside the box-door), and in a moment are on
the black silent water, floating away as if there were
no dry building in the world. It stops, and in a
moment we are out again, upon the broad solid Piazza
of St. Mark, brilliantly lighted with gas, very like the
Palais Royal at Paris, only far more handsome, and
shining with no end of caff&egrave;s. The two old pillars and
the enormous bell-tower are as gruff and solid against
the exquisite starlight as if they were a thousand miles
from the sea or any undermining water: and the front
of the cathedral, overlaid with golden mosaics and beautiful
colours, is like a thousand rainbows even in the
night."</p>

<p>His formerly expressed notions as to art and pictures
in Italy received confirmation at this visit. "I am
more than ever confirmed in my conviction that one
of the great uses of travelling is to encourage a man
to think for himself, to be bold enough always to
declare without offence that he <i>does</i> think for himself,
and to overcome the villainous meanness of professing
what other people have professed when he knows (if he
has capacity to originate an opinion) that his profession
is untrue. The intolerable nonsense against which
genteel taste and subserviency are afraid to rise, in
connection with art, is astounding. Egg's honest
amazement and consternation when he saw some of the
most trumpeted things was what the Americans call 'a
caution.' In the very same hour and minute there were
scores of people falling into conventional raptures with
that very poor Apollo, and passing over the most beautiful
little figures and heads in the whole Vatican because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_92" id="Page_3_92">[92]</a></span>
they were not expressly set up to be worshipped. So in
this place. There are pictures by Tintoretto in Venice,
more delightful and masterly than it is possible sufficiently
to express. His Assembly of the Blest I do believe
to be, take it all in all, the most wonderful and charming
picture ever painted. Your guide-book writer,
representing the general swarming of humbugs, rather
patronizes Tintoretto as a man of some sort of merit;
and (bound to follow Eustace, Forsyth, and all the rest
of them) directs you, on pain of being broke for want
of gentility in appreciation, to go into ecstacies with
things that have neither imagination, nature, proportion,
possibility, nor anything else in them. You
immediately obey, and tell your son to obey. He tells
his son, and he tells his, and so the world gets at three-fourths
of its frauds and miseries."</p>

<p>The last place visited was Turin, where the travellers
arrived on the 5th of December, finding it, with a
brightly shining sun, intensely cold and freezing hard.
"There are double windows to all the rooms, but the
Alpine air comes down and numbs my feet as I write
(in a cap and shawl) within six feet of the fire." There
was yet something better than this to report of that
bracing Alpine air. To Dickens's remarks on the Sardinian
race, and to what he says of the exile of the
noblest Italians, the momentous events of the few following
years gave striking comment; nor could better
proof be afforded of the judgment he brought to the
observation of what passed before him. The letter had
in all respects much interest and attractiveness. "This
is a remarkably agreeable place. A beautiful town,
prosperous, thriving, growing prodigiously, as Genoa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_93" id="Page_3_93">[93]</a></span>
is; crowded with busy inhabitants; full of noble streets
and squares. The Alps, now covered deep with snow,
are close upon it, and here and there seem almost ready
to tumble into the houses. The contrast this part of
Italy presents to the rest, is amazing. Beautifully made
railroads, admirably managed; cheerful, active people;
spirit, energy, life, progress. In Milan, in every street,
the noble palace of some exile is a barrack, and dirty
soldiers are lolling out of the magnificent windows&mdash;it
seems as if the whole place were being gradually absorbed
into soldiers. In Naples, something like a hundred
thousand troops. 'I knew,' I said to a certain
Neapolitan Marchese there whom I had known before,
and who came to see me the night after I arrived, 'I
knew a very remarkable gentleman when I was last
here; who had never been out of his own country, but
was perfectly acquainted with English literature, and
had taught himself to speak English in that wonderful
manner that no one could have known him for a foreigner;
I am very anxious to see him again, but I forget
his name.'&mdash;He named him, and his face fell directly.
'Dead?' said I.&mdash;'In exile.'&mdash;'O dear me!' said I,
'I had looked forward to seeing him again, more than
any one I was acquainted with in the country!'&mdash;'What
would you have!' says the Marchese in a low-voice.
'He was a remarkable man&mdash;full of knowledge,
full of spirit, full of generosity. Where should he be
but in exile! Where could he be!' We said not
another word about it, but I shall always remember the
short dialogue."</p>

<p>On the other hand there were incidents of the Austrian
occupation as to which Dickens thought the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_94" id="Page_3_94">[94]</a></span>
ordinary style of comment unfair; and his closing
remark on their police is well worth preserving. "I
am strongly inclined to think that our countrymen are
to blame in the matter of the Austrian vexations to
travellers that have been complained of. Their manner
is so very bad, they are so extraordinarily suspicious,
so determined to be done by everybody, and give so
much offence. Now, the Austrian police are very strict,
but they really know how to do business, and they do
it. And if you treat them like gentlemen, they will
always respond. When we first crossed the Austrian
frontier, and were ushered into the police office, I took
off my hat. The officer immediately took off his, and
was as polite&mdash;still doing his duty, without any compromise&mdash;as
it was possible to be. When we came to
Venice, the arrangements were very strict, but were so
business-like that the smallest possible amount of inconvenience
consistent with strictness ensued. Here is the
scene. A soldier has come into the railway carriage
(a saloon on the American plan) some miles off, has
touched his hat, and asked for my passport. I have
given it. Soldier has touched his hat again, and retired
as from the presence of superior officer. Alighted
from carriage, we pass into a place like a banking-house,
lighted up with gas. Nobody bullies us or
drives us there, but we must go, because the road ends
there. Several soldierly clerks. One very sharp chief.
My passport is brought out of an inner room, certified
to be en r&egrave;gle. Very sharp chief takes it, looks at it
(it is rather longer, now, than <i>Hamlet</i>), calls out&mdash;'Signor
Carlo Dickens!' 'Here I am sir.' 'Do you
intend remaining long in Venice sir?' 'Probably four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_95" id="Page_3_95">[95]</a></span>
days sir!' 'Italian is known to you sir. You have
been in Venice before?' 'Once before sir.' 'Perhaps
you remained longer then sir?' 'No indeed; I merely
came to see, and went as I came.' 'Truly sir? Do I
infer that you are going by Trieste?' 'No. I am going
to Parma, and Turin, and by Paris home.' 'A cold
journey sir, I hope it may be a pleasant one.' 'Thank
you.'&mdash;He gives me one very sharp look all over, and
wishes me a very happy night. I wish <i>him</i> a very happy
night and it's done. The thing being done at all,
could not be better done, or more politely&mdash;though I
dare say if I had been sucking a gentish cane all the
time, or talking in English to my compatriots, it might
not unnaturally have been different. At Turin and at
Genoa there are no such stoppages at all; but in any
other part of Italy, give me an Austrian in preference
to a native functionary. At Naples it is done in a
beggarly, shambling, bungling, tardy, vulgar way; but
I am strengthened in my old impression that Naples is
one of the most odious places on the face of the earth.
The general degradation oppresses me like foul air."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickens</span> was in Boulogne, in 1853, from the middle
of June to the end of September, and for the next
three months, as we have seen, was in Switzerland and
Italy. In the following year he went again to Boulogne
in June, and stayed, after finishing <i>Hard Times</i>,
until far into October. In February of 1855 he was
for a fortnight in Paris with Mr. Wilkie Collins; not
taking up his more prolonged residence there until the
winter. From November 1855 to the end of April
1856 he made the French capital his home, working
at <i>Little Dorrit</i> during all those months. Then, after
a month's interval in Dover and London, he took up
his third summer residence in Boulogne, whither his
younger children had gone direct from Paris; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_97" id="Page_3_97">[97]</a></span>
stayed until September, finishing <i>Little Dorrit</i> in London
in the spring of 1857.</p>

<p>Of the first of these visits, a few lively notes of
humour and character out of his letters will tell the
story sufficiently. The second and third had points of
more attractiveness. Those were the years of the
French-English alliance, of the great exposition of
English paintings, of the return of the troops from the
Crimea, and of the visit of the Prince Consort to the
Emperor; such interest as Dickens took in these several
matters appearing in his letters with the usual
vividness, and the story of his continental life coming
out with amusing distinctness in the successive pictures
they paint with so much warmth and colour. Another
chapter will be given to Paris. This deals only with
Boulogne.</p>

<p>For his first summer residence, in June 1853, he had
taken a house on the high ground near the Calais road;
an odd French place with the strangest little rooms
and halls, but standing in the midst of a large garden,
with wood and waterfall, a conservatory opening on a
great bank of roses, and paths and gates on one side
to the ramparts, on the other to the sea. Above all
there was a capital proprietor and landlord, by whom
the cost of keeping up gardens and wood (which he
called a forest) was defrayed, while he gave his tenant
the whole range of both and all the flowers for nothing,
sold him the garden produce as it was wanted, and
kept a cow on the estate to supply the family milk.
"If this were but 300 miles farther off," wrote Dickens,
"how the English would rave about it! I do assure
you that there are picturesque people, and town, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_98" id="Page_3_98">[98]</a></span>
country, about this place, that quite fill up the eye and
fancy. As to the fishing people (whose dress can have
changed neither in colour nor in form for many many
years), and their quarter of the town cobweb-hung with
great brown nets across the narrow up-hill streets, they
are as good as Naples, every bit." His description
both of house and landlord, of which I tested the exactness
when I visited him, was in the old pleasant
vein; requiring no connection with himself to give
it interest, but, by the charm and ease with which
everything picturesque or characteristic was disclosed,
placed in the domain of art.</p>

<p>"O the rain here yesterday!" (26th of June.) "A
great sea-fog rolling in, a strong wind blowing, and the
rain coming down in torrents all day long.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This house
is on a great hill-side, backed up by woods of young
trees. It faces the Haute Ville with the ramparts and
the unfinished cathedral&mdash;which capital object is exactly
opposite the windows. On the slope in front,
going steep down to the right, all Boulogne is piled
and jumbled about in a very picturesque manner. The
view is charming&mdash;closed in at last by the tops of
swelling hills; and the door is within ten minutes of
the post-office, and within quarter of an hour of the
sea. The garden is made in terraces up the hill-side,
like an Italian garden; the top walks being in the
before-mentioned woods. The best part of it begins
at the level of the house, and goes up at the back, a
couple of hundred feet perhaps. There are at present
thousands of roses all about the house, and no end of
other flowers. There are five great summer-houses,
and (I think) fifteen fountains&mdash;not one of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_99" id="Page_3_99">[99]</a></span>
(according to the invariable French custom) ever plays.
The house is a doll's house of many rooms. It is one
story high, with eight and thirty steps up and down&mdash;tribune
wise&mdash;to the front door: the noblest French
demonstration I have ever seen I think. It is a double
house; and as there are only four windows and a
pigeon-hole to be beheld in front, you would suppose
it to contain about four rooms. Being built on the
hill-side, the top story of the house at the back&mdash;there
are two stories there&mdash;opens on the level of another
garden. On the ground floor there is a very pretty
hall, almost all glass; a little dining-room opening on
a beautiful conservatory, which is also looked into
through a great transparent glass in a mirror-frame over
the chimney-piece, just as in Paxton's room at Chatsworth;
a spare bed-room, two little drawing-rooms
opening into one another, the family bed-rooms, a
bath-room, a glass corridor, an open yard, and a kind
of kitchen with a machinery of stoves and boilers.
Above, there are eight tiny bed-rooms all opening on
one great room in the roof, originally intended for a
billiard-room. In the basement there is an admirable
kitchen with every conceivable requisite in it, a noble
cellar, first-rate man's room and pantry; coach-house,
stable, coal-store and wood-store; and in the garden
is a pavilion, containing an excellent spare bed-room
on the ground floor. The getting-up of these places,
the looking-glasses, clocks, little stoves, all manner of
fittings, must be seen to be appreciated. The conservatory
is full of choice flowers and perfectly beautiful."</p>

<p>Then came the charm of the letter, his description<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_100" id="Page_3_100">[100]</a></span>
of his landlord, lightly sketched by him in print as M.
Loyal-Devasseur, but here filled in with the most attractive
touches his loving hand could give. "But the
landlord&mdash;M. Beaucourt&mdash;is wonderful. Everybody
here has two surnames (I cannot conceive why), and
M. Beaucourt, as he is always called, is by rights M.
Beaucourt-Mutuel. He is a portly jolly fellow with a
fine open face; lives on the hill behind, just outside
the top of the garden; and was a linen draper in the
town, where he still has a shop, but is supposed to have
mortgaged his business and to be in difficulties&mdash;all
along of this place, which he has planted with his own
hands; which he cultivates all day; and which he
never on any consideration speaks of but as 'the
Property.' He is extraordinarily popular in Boulogne
(the people in the shops invariably brightening up at
the mention of his name, and congratulating us on
being his tenants), and really seems to deserve it. He
is such a liberal fellow that I can't bear to ask him for
anything, since he instantly supplies it whatever it is.
The things he has done in respect of unreasonable bedsteads
and washing-stands, I blush to think of. I
observed the other day in one of the side gardens&mdash;there
are gardens at each side of the house too&mdash;a place
where I thought the Comic Countryman" (a name he
was giving just then to his youngest boy) "must infallibly
trip over, and make a little descent of a dozen
feet. So I said, 'M. Beaucourt'&mdash;who instantly pulled
off his cap and stood bareheaded&mdash;'there are some
spare pieces of wood lying by the cow-house, if you
would have the kindness to have one laid across here I
think it would be safer.' 'Ah, mon dieu sir,' said M.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_101" id="Page_3_101">[101]</a></span>
Beaucourt, 'it must be iron. This is not a portion of
the property where you would like to see wood.' 'But
iron is so expensive,' said I, 'and it really is not worth
while&mdash;&mdash;' 'Sir, pardon me a thousand times,' said
M. Beaucourt, 'it shall be iron. Assuredly and perfectly
it shall be iron.' 'Then M. Beaucourt,' said I,
'I shall be glad to pay a moiety of the cost.' 'Sir,'
said M. Beaucourt, 'Never!' Then to change the
subject, he slided from his firmness and gravity into a
graceful conversational tone, and said, 'In the moonlight
last night, the flowers on the property appeared,
O Heaven, to be <i>bathing themselves in the sky</i>. You
like the property?' 'M. Beaucourt,' said I, 'I am
enchanted with it; I am more than satisfied with everything.'
'And I sir,' said M. Beaucourt, laying his
cap upon his breast, and kissing his hand&mdash;'I equally!'
Yesterday two blacksmiths came for a day's work, and
put up a good solid handsome bit of iron-railing, morticed
into the stone parapet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If the extraordinary
things in the house defy description, the amazing phenomena
in the gardens never could have been dreamed
of by anybody but a Frenchman bent upon one idea.
Besides a portrait of the house in the dining-room,
there is a plan of the property in the hall. It looks
about the size of Ireland; and to every one of the
extraordinary objects, there is a reference with some
portentous name. There are fifty-one such references,
including the Cottage of Tom Thumb, the Bridge of
Austerlitz, the Bridge of Jena, the Hermitage, the
Bower of the Old Guard, the Labyrinth (I have no
idea which is which); and there is guidance to every
room in the house, as if it were a place on that stupendous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_102" id="Page_3_102">[102]</a></span>
scale that without such a clue you must infallibly
lose your way, and perhaps perish of starvation
between bedroom and bedroom."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>On the 3rd of July there came a fresh trait of the
good fellow of a landlord. "Fancy what Beaucourt
told me last night. When he 'conceived the inspiration'
of planting the property ten years ago, he went
over to England to buy the trees, took a small cottage
in the market-gardens at Putney, lived there three
months, held a symposium every night attended by the
principal gardeners of Fulham, Putney, Kew, and Hammersmith
(which he calls Hamsterdam), and wound
up with a supper at which the market-gardeners rose,
clinked their glasses, and exclaimed with one accord (I
quote him exactly) <span class="smcap">Vive Beaucourt</span>! He was a captain
in the National Guard, and Cavaignac his general.
Brave Capitaine Beaucourt! said Cavaignac, you must
receive a decoration. My General, said Beaucourt, No!
It is enough for me that I have done my duty. I go to
lay the first stone of a house upon a Property I have&mdash;that
house shall be my decoration. (Regard that
house!)" Addition to the picture came in a letter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_103" id="Page_3_103">[103]</a></span>
the 24th of July: with a droll glimpse of Shakespeare
at the theatre, and of the Saturday's pig-market.</p>

<p>"I may mention that the great Beaucourt daily
changes the orthography of this place. He has now
fixed it, by having painted up outside the garden gate,
'Entr&eacute;e particuli&egrave;re de la Villa des Moulineaux.' On
another gate a little higher up, he has had painted
'Entr&eacute;e des Ecuries de la Villa des Moulineaux.'
On another gate a little lower down (applicable to one
of the innumerable buildings in the garden), 'Entr&eacute;e
du Tom Pouce.' On the highest gate of the lot,
leading to his own house, 'Entr&eacute;e du Ch&acirc;teau Napol&eacute;onienne.'
All of which inscriptions you will behold
in black and white when you come. I see little of
him now, as, all things being 'bien arrang&eacute;es,' he is
delicate of appearing. His wife has been making a
trip in the country during the last three weeks, but (as
he mentioned to me with his hat in his hand) it was
necessary that he should remain here, to be continually
at the disposition of the tenant of the Property. (The
better to do this, he has had roaring dinner parties of
fifteen daily; and the old woman who milks the cows
has been fainting up the hill under vast burdens of
champagne.)</p>

<p>"We went to the theatre last night, to see the <i>Midsummer
Night's Dream</i>&mdash;of the Opera Comique. It is a
beautiful little theatre now, with a very good company;
and the nonsense of the piece was done with a sense
quite confounding in that connexion. Willy Am Shay
Kes Peer; Sirzhon Foll Stayffe; Lor Lattimeer; and
that celebrated Maid of Honour to Queen Elizabeth,
Meees Oleeveeir&mdash;were the principal characters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_104" id="Page_3_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Outside the old town, an army of workmen are
(and have been for a week or so, already) employed
upon an immense building which I supposed might
be a Fort, or a Monastery, or a Barrack, or other something
designed to last for ages. I find it is for the annual
fair, which begins on the fifth of August and lasts a
fortnight. Almost every Sunday we have a f&ecirc;te, where
there is dancing in the open air, and where immense
men with prodigious beards revolve on little wooden
horses like Italian irons, in what we islanders call a
roundabout, by the hour together. But really the good
humour and cheerfulness are very delightful. Among
the other sights of the place, there is a pig-market
every Saturday, perfectly insupportable in its absurdity.
An excited French peasant, male or female, with a
determined young pig, is the most amazing spectacle.
I saw a little Drama enacted yesterday week, the drollery
of which was perfect. <i>Dram. Pers.</i> 1. A pretty
young woman with short petticoats and trim blue
stockings, riding a donkey with two baskets and a pig
in each. 2. An ancient farmer in a blouse, driving
four pigs, his four in hand, with an enormous whip&mdash;and
being drawn against walls and into smoking shops
by any one of the four. 3. A cart, with an old pig
(manacled) looking out of it, and terrifying six hundred
and fifty young pigs in the market by his terrific
grunts. 4. Collector of Octroi in an immense cocked
hat, with a stream of young pigs running, night and
day, between his military boots and rendering accounts
impossible. 5. Inimitable, confronted by a radiation
of elderly pigs, fastened each by one leg to a bunch
of stakes in the ground. 6. John Edmund Reade,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_105" id="Page_3_105">[105]</a></span>
poet, expressing eternal devotion to and admiration
of Landor, unconscious of approaching pig recently
escaped from barrow. 7. Priests, peasants, soldiers,
&amp;c. &amp;c."</p>

<p>He had meanwhile gathered friendly faces round
him. Frank Stone went over with his family to a house
taken for him on the St. Omer road by Dickens, who
was joined in the chateau by Mr. and Mrs. Leech and
Mr. Wilkie Collins. "Leech says that when he stepped
from the boat after their stormy passage, he was received
by the congregated spectators with a distinct
round of applause as by far the most intensely and unutterably
miserable looking object that had yet appeared.
The laughter was tumultuous, and he wishes his friends
to know that altogether he made an immense hit." So
passed the summer months: excursions with these
friends to Amiens and Beauvais relieving the work
upon his novel, and the trip to Italy, already described,
following on its completion.</p>

<p>In June, 1854, M. Beaucourt had again received his
famous tenant, but in another cottage or chateau (to
him convertible terms) on the much cherished property,
placed on the very summit of the hill with a private
road leading out to the Column, a really pretty
place, rooms larger than in the other house, a noble
sea view, everywhere nice prospects, good garden, and
plenty of sloping turf.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> It was called the Villa du<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_106" id="Page_3_106">[106]</a></span>
Camp de Droite, and here Dickens stayed, as I have
intimated, until the eve of his winter residence in
Paris.</p>

<p>The formation of the Northern Camp at Boulogne
began the week after he had finished <i>Hard Times</i>, and
he watched its progress, as it increased and extended
itself along the cliffs towards Calais, with the liveliest
amusement. At first he was startled by the suddenness
with which soldiers overran the roads, became billeted
in every house, made the bridges red with their
trowsers, and "sprang upon the pier like fantastic
mustard and cress when boats were expected, many of
them never having seen the sea before." But the good
behaviour of the men had a reconciling effect, and
their ingenuity delighted him. The quickness with
which they raised whole streets of mud-huts, less picturesque
than the tents,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> but (like most unpicturesque
things) more comfortable, was like an Arabian Nights'
tale. "Each little street holds 144 men, and every
corner-door has the number of the street upon it as
soon as it is put up; and the postmen can fall to work
as easily as in the Rue de Rivoli at Paris." His patience
was again a little tried when he found baggage-wagons
ploughing up his favourite walks, and trumpeters
in twos and threes teaching newly-recruited trumpeters
in all the sylvan places, and making the echoes hideous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_107" id="Page_3_107">[107]</a></span>
But this had its amusement too. "I met to-day a
weazen sun-burnt youth from the south with such an
immense regimental shako on, that he looked like a
sort of lucifer match-box, evidently blowing his life
rapidly out, under the auspices of two magnificent
creatures all hair and lungs, of such breadth across the
shoulders that I couldn't see their breast-buttons when
I stood in front of them."</p>

<p>The interest culminated as the visit of the Prince
Consort approached with its attendant glories of illuminations
and reviews. Beaucourt's excitement became
intense. The Villa du Camp de Droite was to be a
blaze of triumph on the night of the arrival; Dickens,
who had carried over with him the meteor flag of England
and set it streaming over a haystack in his field,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
now hoisted the French colours over the British Jack
in honour of the national alliance; the Emperor was
to subside to the station of a general officer, so that all
the rejoicings should be in honour of the Prince; and
there was to be a review in the open country near
Wimereux, when "at one stage of the maneuvres (I
am too excited to spell the word but you know what I
mean)" the whole hundred thousand men in the camp
of the North were to be placed before the Prince's
eyes, to show him what a division of the French army
might be. "I believe everything I hear," said Dickens.
It was the state of mind of Hood's country gentleman
after the fire at the Houses of Parliament. "Beaucourt,
as one of the town council, receives summonses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_108" id="Page_3_108">[108]</a></span>
to turn out and debate about something, or receive
somebody, every five minutes. Whenever I look out
of window, or go to the door, I see an immense black
object at Beaucourt's porch like a boat set up on end
in the air with a pair of white trowsers below it. This
is the cocked hat of an official Huissier, newly arrived
with a summons, whose head is thrown back as he is in
the act of drinking Beaucourt's wine." The day came
at last, and all Boulogne turned out for its holiday;
"but I" Dickens wrote, "had by this cooled down a
little, and, reserving myself for the illuminations, I
abandoned the great men and set off upon my usual
country walk. See my reward. Coming home by the
Calais road, covered with dust, I suddenly find myself
face to face with Albert and Napoleon, jogging along in
the pleasantest way, a little in front, talking extremely
loud about the view, and attended by a brilliant staff
of some sixty or seventy horsemen, with a couple of
our royal grooms with their red coats riding oddly
enough in the midst of the magnates. I took off my
wide-awake without stopping to stare, whereupon the
Emperor pulled off his cocked hat; and Albert (seeing,
I suppose, that it was an Englishman) pulled off his.
Then we went our several ways. The Emperor is
broader across the chest than in the old times when we
used to see him so often at Gore-<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'House'">house</ins>, and stoops
more in the shoulders. Indeed his carriage thereabouts
is like Fonblanque's."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The town he described as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_109" id="Page_3_109">[109]</a></span>
"one great flag" for the rest of the visit; and to the
success of the illuminations he contributed largely himself
by leading off splendidly with a hundred and
twenty wax candles blazing in his seventeen front
windows, and visible from that great height over all
the place. "On the first eruption Beaucourt <i>danced
and screamed</i> on the grass before the door; and when
he was more composed, set off with Madame Beaucourt
to look at the house from every possible quarter, and,
he said, collect the suffrages of his compatriots."</p>

<p>Their suffrages seem to have gone, however, mainly
in another direction. "It was wonderful," Dickens
wrote, "to behold about the streets the small French
soldiers of the line seizing our Guards by the hand and
embracing them. It was wonderful, too, to behold the
English sailors in the town, shaking hands with everybody
and generally patronizing everything. When the
people could not get hold of either a soldier or a
sailor, they rejoiced in the royal grooms, and embraced
<i>them</i>. I don't think the Boulogne people were surprised
by anything so much, as by the three cheers
the crew of the yacht gave when the Emperor went
aboard to lunch. The prodigious volume of them,
and the precision, and the circumstance that no man
was left straggling on his own account either before or
afterwards, seemed to strike the general mind with
amazement. Beaucourt said it was <i>like boxing</i>." That
was written on the 10th of September; but in a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_110" id="Page_3_110">[110]</a></span>
few days Dickens was unwillingly convinced that whatever
the friendly disposition to England might be, the
war with Russia was decidedly unpopular. He was
present when the false report of the taking of Sebastopol
reached the Emperor and Empress. "I was at
the Review" (8th of October) "yesterday week, very
near the Emperor and Empress, when the taking of
Sebastopol was announced. It was a magnificent show
on a magnificent day; and if any circumstance could
make it special, the arrival of the telegraphic despatch
would be the culminating point one might suppose.
It quite disturbed and mortified me to find how faintly,
feebly, miserably, the men responded to the call of the
officers to cheer, as each regiment passed by. Fifty excited
Englishmen would make a greater sign and sound
than a thousand of these men do.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Empress
was very pretty, and her slight figure sat capitally on
her grey horse. When the Emperor gave her the
despatch to read, she flushed and fired up in a very
pleasant way, and kissed it with as natural an impulse
as one could desire to see."</p>

<p>On the night of that day Dickens went up to see a
play acted at a caf&eacute; at the camp, and found himself one
of an audience composed wholly of officers and men,
with only four ladies among them, officers' wives.
The steady, working, sensible faces all about him
told their own story; "and as to kindness and consideration
towards the poor actors, it was real benevolence."
Another attraction at the camp was a conjuror,
who had been called to exhibit twice before the imperial
party, and whom Dickens always afterwards referred
to as the most consummate master of legerdemain he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_111" id="Page_3_111">[111]</a></span>
seen. Nor was he a mean authority as to this, being
himself, with his tools at hand, a capital conjuror;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_112" id="Page_3_112">[112]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
but the Frenchman scorned help, stood among the
company without any sort of apparatus, and, by the
mere force of sleight of hand and an astonishing memory,
performed feats having no likeness to anything
Dickens had ever seen done, and totally inexplicable
to his most vigilant reflection. "So far as I know,
a perfectly original genius, and that puts any sort of
knowledge of legerdemain, such as I supposed that I
possessed, at utter defiance." The account he gave
dealt with two exploits only, the easiest to describe,
and, not being with cards, not the most remarkable;
for he would also say of this Frenchman that he transformed
cards into very demons. He never saw a human
hand touch them in the same way, fling them about
so amazingly, or change them in his, one's own, or
another's hand, with a skill so impossible to follow.</p>

<p>"You are to observe that he was <i>with the company</i>,
not in the least removed from them; and that we occupied
the front row. He brought in some writing paper
with him when he entered, and a black-lead pencil;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_113" id="Page_3_113">[113]</a></span>
and he wrote some words on half-sheets of paper. One
of these half-sheets he folded into two, and gave to
Catherine to hold. Madame, he says aloud, will you
think of any class of objects? I have done so.&mdash;Of
what class, Madame? Animals.&mdash;Will you think of a
particular animal, Madame? I have done so.&mdash;Of
what animal? The Lion.&mdash;Will you think of another
class of objects, Madame? I have done so.&mdash;Of what
class? Flowers.&mdash;The particular flower? The Rose.&mdash;Will
you open the paper you hold in your hand?
She opened it, and there was neatly and plainly written
in pencil&mdash;<i>The Lion.</i> <i>The Rose.</i> Nothing whatever
had led up to these words, and they were the most
distant conceivable from Catherine's thoughts when
she entered the room. He had several common school-slates
about a foot square. He took one of these to a
field-officer from the camp, decor&eacute; and what not, who
sat about six from us, with a grave saturnine friend next
him. My General, says he, will you write a name on
this slate, after your friend has done so? Don't show
it to me. The friend wrote a name, and the General
wrote a name. The conjuror took the slate rapidly
from the officer, threw it violently down on the ground
with its written side to the floor, and asked the officer
to put his foot upon it and keep it there: which he
did. The conjuror considered for about a minute,
looking devilish hard at the General.&mdash;My General,
says he, your friend wrote Dagobert, upon the slate
under your foot. The friend admits it.&mdash;And you,
my General, wrote Nicholas. General admits it, and
everybody laughs and applauds.&mdash;My General, will you
excuse me, if I change that name into a name expressive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_114" id="Page_3_114">[114]</a></span>
of the power of a great nation, which, in happy
alliance with the gallantry and spirit of France will
shake that name to its centre? Certainly I will excuse
it.&mdash;My General, take up the slate and read. General
reads: <span class="smcap">Dagobert, Victoria</span>. The first in his friend's
writing; the second in a new hand. I never saw anything
in the least like this; or at all approaching to the
absolute certainty, the familiarity, quickness, absence
of all machinery, and actual face-to-face, hand-to-hand
fairness between the conjuror and the audience, with
which it was done. I have not the slightest idea of
the secret.&mdash;One more. He was blinded with several
table napkins, and then a great cloth was bodily thrown
over them and his head too, so that his voice sounded
as if he were under a bed. Perhaps half a dozen dates
were written on a slate. He takes the slate in his hand,
and throws it violently down on the floor as before,
remains silent a minute, seems to become agitated, and
bursts out thus: 'What is this I see? A great city,
but of narrow streets and old-fashioned houses, many
of which are of wood, resolving itself into ruins! How
is it falling into ruins? Hark! I hear the crackling
of a great conflagration, and, looking up, I behold a
vast cloud of flame and smoke. The ground is covered
with hot cinders too, and people are flying into the
fields and endeavouring to save their goods. This
great fire, this great wind, this roaring noise! This is
the great fire of London, and the first date upon the
slate must be one, six, six, six&mdash;the year in which it
happened!' And so on with all the other dates.
There! Now, if you will take a cab and impart these
mysteries to Rogers, I shall be very glad to have his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_115" id="Page_3_115">[115]</a></span>
opinion of them." Rogers had taxed our credulity
with some wonderful clairvoyant experiences of his own
in Paris to which here was a parallel at last!</p>

<p>When leaving Paris for his third visit to Boulogne,
at the beginning of June 1856, he had not written a
word of the ninth number of his new book, and did
not expect for another month to "see land from the
running sea of <i>Little Dorrit</i>." He had resumed the
house he first occupied, the cottage or villa "des Moulineaux,"
and after dawdling about his garden for a
few days with surprising industry in a French farmer
garb of blue blouse, leathern belt, and military cap,
which he had mounted as "the only one for complete
comfort," he wrote to me that he was getting "Now
to work again&mdash;to work! The story lies before me, I
hope, strong and clear. Not to be easily told; but
nothing of that sort <span class="smcap">is</span> to be easily done that <i>I</i> know
of." At work it became his habit to sit late, and then,
putting off his usual walk until night, to lie down
among the roses reading until after tea ("middle-aged
Love in a blouse and belt"), when he went down to
the pier. "The said pier at evening is a phase of
the place we never see, and which I hardly knew. But
I never did behold such specimens of the youth of my
country, male and female, as pervade that place. They
are really, in their vulgarity and insolence, quite disheartening.
One is so fearfully ashamed of them, and
they contrast so very unfavourably with the natives."
Mr. Wilkie Collins was again his companion in the
summer weeks, and the presence of Jerrold for the
greater part of the time added much to his enjoyment.</p>

<p>The last of the camp was now at hand. It had only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_116" id="Page_3_116">[116]</a></span>
a battalion of men in it, and a few days would see
them out. At first there was horrible weather, "storms
of wind, rushes of rain, heavy squalls, cold airs, sea
fogs, banging shutters, flapping doors, and beaten down
rose-trees by the hundred; but then came a delightful
week among the corn fields and bean fields, and afterwards
the end. It looks very singular and very
miserable. The soil being sand, and the grass having
been trodden away these two years, the wind from the
sea carries the sand into the chinks and ledges of all the
doors and windows, and chokes them;&mdash;just as if they
belonged to Arab huts in the desert. A number of
the non-commissioned officers made turf-couches outside
their huts, and there were turf orchestras for the
bands to play in; all of which are fast getting sanded
over in a most Egyptian manner. The Fair is on, under
the walls of the haute ville over the way. At one
popular show, the Malakhoff is taken every half-hour
between 4 and 11. Bouncing explosions announce
every triumph of the French arms (the English have
nothing to do with it); and in the intervals a man outside
blows a railway whistle&mdash;straight into the dining-room.
Do you know that the French soldiers call the
English medal 'The Salvage Medal'&mdash;meaning that
they got it for saving the English army? I don't suppose
there are a thousand people in all France who
believe that we did anything but get rescued by the
French. And I am confident that the no-result of our
precious Chelsea enquiry has wonderfully strengthened
this conviction. Nobody at home has yet any adequate
idea, I am deplorably sure, of what the Barnacles and
the Circumlocution Office have done for us. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_117" id="Page_3_117">[117]</a></span>
whenever we get into war again, the people will begin
to find out."</p>

<p>His own household had got into a small war already,
of which the commander-in-chief was his man-servant
"French," the bulk of the forces engaged being his
children, and the invaders two cats. Business brought
him to London on the hostilities breaking out, and on
his return after a few days the story of the war was told.
"Dick," it should be said, was a canary very dear both
to Dickens and his eldest daughter, who had so tamed
to her loving hand its wild little heart that it was become
the most docile of companions.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> "The only
thing new in this garden is that war is raging against
two particularly tigerish and fearful cats (from the mill,
I suppose), which are always glaring in dark corners,
after our wonderful little Dick. Keeping the house
open at all points, it is impossible to shut them out, and
they hide themselves in the most terrific manner: hanging
themselves up behind draperies, like bats, and
tumbling out in the dead of night with frightful caterwaulings.
Hereupon, French borrows Beaucourt's gun,
loads the same to the muzzle, discharges it twice in vain
and throws himself over with the recoil, exactly like
a clown. But at last (while I was in town) he aims
at the more amiable cat of the two, and shoots that
animal dead. Insufferably elated by this victory, he is
now engaged from morning to night in hiding behind
bushes to get aim at the other. He does nothing else
whatever. All the boys encourage him and watch for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_118" id="Page_3_118">[118]</a></span>
the enemy&mdash;on whose appearance they give an alarm
which immediately serves as a warning to the creature,
who runs away. They are at this moment (ready
dressed for church) all lying on their stomachs in various
parts of the garden. Horrible whistles give notice
to the gun what point it is to approach. I am afraid
to go out, lest I should be shot. Mr. Plornish says
his prayers at night in a whisper, lest the cat should
overhear him and take offence. The tradesmen cry
out as they come up the avenue, 'Me voici! C'est moi&mdash;boulanger&mdash;ne
tirez pas, Monsieur Franche!' It is
like living in a state of siege; and the wonderful
manner in which the cat preserves the character of
being the only person not much put out by the intensity
of this monomania, is most ridiculous." (6th of July.) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
"About four pounds of powder and half a ton of
shot have been (13th of July) fired off at the cat (and
the public in general) during the week. The finest thing
is that immediately after I have heard the noble sportsman
blazing away at her in the garden in front, I look
out of my room door into the drawing-room, and am
pretty sure to see her coming in after the birds, in the
calmest manner, by the back window. Intelligence
has been brought to me from a source on which I can
rely, that French has newly conceived the atrocious
project of tempting her into the coach-house by meat
and kindness, and there, from an elevated portmanteau,
blowing her head off. This I mean sternly to interdict,
and to do so to-day as a work of piety."</p>

<p>Besides the graver work which Mr. Wilkie Collins
and himself were busy with, in these months, and by
which <i>Household Words</i> mainly was to profit, some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_119" id="Page_3_119">[119]</a></span>
lighter matters occupied the leisure of both. There
were to be, at Christmas, theatricals again at Tavistock
House; in which the children, with the help of their
father and other friends, were to follow up the success
of the <i>Lighthouse</i> by again acquitting themselves as
grown-up actors; and Mr. Collins was busy preparing
for them a new drama to be called <i>The Frozen Deep</i>,
while Dickens was sketching a farce for Mr. Lemon to
fill in. But this pleasant employment had sudden and
sad interruption.</p>

<p>An epidemic broke out in the town, affecting the
children of several families known to Dickens, among
them that of his friend Mr. Gilbert A'Becket; who,
upon arriving from Paris, and finding a favourite little
son stricken dangerously, sank himself under an illness
from which he had been suffering, and died two days
after the boy. "He had for three days shown symptoms
of rallying, and we had some hope of his recovery;
but he sank and died, and never even knew that
the child had gone before him. A sad, sad story."
Dickens meanwhile had sent his own children home
with his wife, and the rest soon followed. Poor M.
Beaucourt was inconsolable. "The desolation of the
place is wretched. When Mamey and Katey went,
Beaucourt came in and wept. He really is almost
broken-hearted about it. He had planted all manner
of flowers for next month, and has thrown down the
spade and left off weeding the garden, so that it looks
something like a dreary bird-cage with all manner of
grasses and chickweeds sticking through the bars and
lying in the sand. 'Such a loss too,' he says, 'for
Monsieur Dickens!' Then he looks in at the kitchen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_120" id="Page_3_120">[120]</a></span>
window (which seems to be his only relief), and sighs
himself up the hill home."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>The interval of residence in Paris between these two
last visits to Boulogne is now to be described.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Paris Dickens's life was passed among artists, and
in the exercise of his own art. His associates were
writers, painters, actors, or musicians, and when he
wanted relief from any strain of work he found it at
the theatre. The years since his last residence in the
great city had made him better known, and the increased
attentions pleased him. He had to help in
preparing for a translation of his books into French;
and this, with continued labour at the story he had in
hand, occupied him as long as he remained. It will be
all best told by extracts from his letters; in which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_122" id="Page_3_122">[122]</a></span>
people he met, the theatres he visited, and the incidents,
public or private, that seemed to him worthy of
mention, reappear with the old force and liveliness.</p>

<p>Nor is anything better worth preserving from them
than choice bits of description of an actor or a drama,
for this perishable enjoyment has only so much as may
survive out of such recollections to witness for itself to
another generation; and an unusually high place may
be challenged for the subtlety and delicacy of what is
said in these letters of things theatrical, when the writer
was especially attracted by a performer or a play.
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Lemaitre has never had a higher tribute than
Dickens paid to him during his few days' earlier stay at
Paris in the spring.</p>

<p>"Incomparably the finest acting I ever saw, I saw
last night at the Ambigu. They have revived that old
piece, once immensely popular in London under the
name of <i>Thirty Years of a Gambler's Life</i>. Old Lemaitre
plays his famous character,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and never did I see
anything, in art, so exaltedly horrible and awful. In
the earlier acts he was so well made up, and so light
and active, that he really looked sufficiently young.
But in the last two, when he had grown old and miserable,
he did the finest things, I really believe, that are
within the power of acting. Two or three times, a
great cry of horror went all round the house. When
he met, in the inn yard, the traveller whom he murders,
and first saw his money, the manner in which the crime<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_123" id="Page_3_123">[123]</a></span>
came into his head&mdash;and eyes&mdash;was as truthful as it was
terrific. This traveller, being a good fellow, gives him
wine. You should see the dim remembrance of his
better days that comes over him as he takes the glass,
and in a strange dazed way makes as if he were going
to touch the other man's, or do some airy thing with
it; and then stops and flings the contents down his hot
throat, as if he were pouring it into a lime-kiln. But
this was nothing to what follows after he has done the
murder, and comes home, with a basket of provisions,
a ragged pocket full of money, and a badly-washed
bloody right hand&mdash;which his little girl finds out.
After the child asked him if he had hurt his hand, his
going aside, turning himself round, and looking over
all his clothes for spots, was so inexpressibly dreadful
that it really scared one. He called for wine, and the
sickness that came upon him when he saw the colour,
was one of the things that brought out the curious cry
I have spoken of, from the audience. Then he fell into
a sort of bloody mist, and went on to the end groping
about, with no mind for anything, except making his
fortune by staking this money, and a faint dull kind of
love for the child. It is quite impossible to satisfy
one's-self by saying enough of such a magnificent performance.
I have never seen him come near its finest
points, in anything else. He said two things in a way
that alone would put him far apart from all other actors.
One to his wife, when he has exultingly shewn her the
money and she has asked him how he got it&mdash;'I found
it'&mdash;and the other to his old companion and tempter,
when he charged him with having killed that traveller,
and he suddenly went headlong mad and took him by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_124" id="Page_3_124">[124]</a></span>
the throat and howled out, 'It wasn't I who murdered
him&mdash;it was Misery!' And such a dress; such a face;
and, above all, such an extraordinary guilty wicked
thing as he made of a knotted branch of a tree which
was his walking-stick, from the moment when the idea
of the murder came into his head! I could write pages
about him. It is an impression quite ineffaceable. He
got half-boastful of that walking-staff to himself, and
half-afraid of it; and didn't know whether to be grimly
pleased that it had the jagged end, or to hate it and be
horrified at it. He sat at a little table in the inn-yard,
drinking with the traveller; and this horrible stick got
between them like the Devil, while he counted on his
fingers the uses he could put the money to."</p>

<p>That was at the close of February. In October,
Dickens's longer residence began. He betook himself
with his family, after two unsuccessful attempts in the
new region of the Rue Balzac and Rue Lord Byron,
to an apartment in the Avenue des Champs Elys&eacute;es.
Over him was an English bachelor with an establishment
consisting of an English groom and five English
horses. "The concierge and his wife told us that his
name was <i>Six</i>, which drove me nearly mad until we
discovered it to be <i>Sykes</i>." The situation was a good
one, very cheerful for himself and with amusement for
his children. It was a quarter of a mile above Franconi's
on the other side of the way, and within a door
or two of the Jardin d'Hiver. The Exposition was just
below; the Barri&egrave;re de l'Etoile from a quarter to half
a mile below; and all Paris, including Emperor and
Empress coming from and returning to St. Cloud,
thronged past the windows in open carriages or on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_125" id="Page_3_125">[125]</a></span>
horseback, all day long. Now it was he found himself
more of a celebrity than when he had wintered in the
city nine years before;<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> the feuilleton of the <i>Moniteur</i>
was filled daily with a translation of <i>Chuzzlewit;</i> and
he had soon to consider the proposal I have named, to
publish in French his collected novels and tales.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_126" id="Page_3_126">[126]</a></span>
he had been a week in his new abode, Ary Scheffer,
"a frank and noble fellow," had made his acquaintance;
introduced him to several distinguished Frenchmen;
and expressed the wish to paint him. To Scheffer
was also due an advantage obtained for my friend's two
little daughters of which they may always keep the
memory with pride. "Mamey and Katey are learning
Italian, and their master is Manin of Venetian fame,
the best and the noblest of those unhappy gentlemen.
He came here with a wife and a beloved daughter, and
they are both dead. Scheffer made him known to me,
and has been, I understand, wonderfully generous and
good to him." Nor may I omit to state the enjoyment
afforded him, not only by the presence in Paris
during the winter of Mr. Wilkie Collins and of Mr.
and Mrs. White of Bonchurch, but by the many friends
from England whom the Art Exposition brought over.
Sir Alexander Cockburn was one of these; Edwin Landseer,
Charles Robert Leslie, and William Boxall, were
others. Macready left his retreat at Sherborne to
make him a visit of several days. Thackeray went to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_127" id="Page_3_127">[127]</a></span>
and fro all the time between London and his mother's
house, also in the Champs Elys&eacute;es, where his daughters
were. And Paris for the time was the home of Robert
Lytton, who belonged to the Embassy, of the Sartorises,
of the Brownings, and of others whom Dickens
liked and cared for.</p>

<p>At the first play he went to, the performance was
stopped while the news of the last Crimean engagement,
just issued in a supplement to the <i>Moniteur</i>, was read
from the stage. "It made not the faintest effect upon
the audience; and even the hired claqueurs, who had
been absurdly loud during the piece, seemed to consider
the war not at all within their contract, and were
as stagnant as ditch-water. The theatre was full. It
is quite impossible to see such apathy, and suppose the
war to be popular, whatever may be asserted to the contrary."
The day before, he had met the Emperor and
the King of Sardinia in the streets, "and, as usual, no
man touching his hat, and very very few so much as
looking round."</p>

<p>The success of a most agreeable little piece by our
old friend Regnier took him next to the Fran&ccedil;ais,
where Plessy's acting enchanted him. "Of course the
interest of it turns upon a flawed piece of living china
(<i>that</i> seems to be positively essential), but, as in most
of these cases, if you will accept the position in which
you find the people, you have nothing more to bother
your morality about." The theatre in the Rue Richelieu,
however, was not generally his favourite resort.
He used to talk of it whimsically as a kind of tomb,
where you went, as the Eastern people did in the
stories, to think of your unsuccessful loves and dead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_128" id="Page_3_128">[128]</a></span>
relations. "There is a dreary classicality at that establishment
calculated to freeze the marrow. Between
ourselves, even one's best friends there are at times
very aggravating. One tires of seeing a man, through
any number of acts, remembering everything by patting
his forehead with the flat of his hand, jerking out sentences
by shaking himself, and piling them up in pyramids
over his head with his right forefinger. And they
have a generic small comedy-piece, where you see two
sofas and three little tables, to which a man enters with
his hat on, to talk to another man&mdash;and in respect of
which you know exactly when he will get up from one
sofa to sit on the other, and take his hat off one table
to put it upon the other&mdash;which strikes one quite as
ludicrously as a good farce.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There seems to be
a good piece at the Vaudeville, on the idea of the <i>Town
and Country Mouse</i>. It is too respectable and inoffensive
for me to-night, but I hope to see it before I leave .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
have a horrible idea of making friends with Franconi,
and sauntering when I am at work into their sawdust
green-room."</p>

<p>At a theatre of a yet heavier school than the Fran&ccedil;ais
he had a drearier experience. "On Wednesday
we went to the Od&eacute;on to see a new piece, in four acts
and in verse, called <i>Michel Cervantes</i>. I suppose such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_129" id="Page_3_129">[129]</a></span>
an infernal dose of ditch water never was concocted.
But there were certain passages, describing the suppression
of public opinion in Madrid, which were received
with a shout of savage application to France that made
one stare again! And once more, here again, at every
pause, steady, compact, regular as military drums, the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Ca'">&Ccedil;a</ins> Ira!" On another night, even at the Porte St.
Martin, drawn there doubtless by the attraction of
repulsion, he supped full with the horrors of classicality
at a performance of <i>Orestes</i> versified by Alexandre
Dumas. "Nothing have I ever seen so weighty and
so ridiculous. If I had not already learnt to tremble
at the sight of classic drapery on the human form, I
should have plumbed the utmost depths of terrified
boredom in this achievement. The chorus is not preserved
otherwise than that bits of it are taken out for
characters to speak. It is really so bad as to be almost
good. Some of the Frenchified classical anguish struck
me as so unspeakably ridiculous that it puts me on the
broad grin as I write."</p>

<p>At the same theatre, in the early spring, he had a
somewhat livelier entertainment. "I was at the Porte
St. Martin last night, where there is a rather good
melodrama called <i>Sang Mel&eacute;</i>, in which one of the characters
is an English Lord&mdash;Lord William Falkland&mdash;who
is called throughout the piece Milor Williams
Fack Lorn, and is a hundred times described by others
and described by himself as Williams. He is admirably
played; but two English travelling ladies are beyond
expression ridiculous, and there is something positively
vicious in their utter want of truth. One 'set,' where
the action of a whole act is supposed to take place in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_130" id="Page_3_130">[130]</a></span>
the great wooden verandah of a Swiss hotel overhanging
a mountain ravine, is the best piece of stage carpentering
I have seen in France. Next week we are
to have at the Ambigu <i>Paradise Lost</i>, with the murder
of Abel, and the Deluge. The wildest rumours are
afloat as to the un-dressing of our first parents." Anticipation
far outdoes a reality of this kind; and at
the fever-pitch to which rumours raised it here, Dickens
might vainly have attempted to get admission on the
first night, if Mr. Webster, the English manager and
comedian, had not obtained a ticket for him. He went
with Mr. Wilkie Collins. "We were rung in (out of
the caf&eacute; below the Ambigu) at 8, and the play was over
at half-past 1; the waits between the acts being very
much longer than the acts themselves. The house was
crammed to excess in every part, and the galleries
awful with Blouses, who again, during the whole of the
waits, beat with the regularity of military drums the
revolutionary tune of famous memory&mdash;<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Ca'">&Ccedil;a</ins> Ira! The
play is a compound of <i>Paradise Lost</i> and Byron's <i>Cain;</i>
and some of the controversies between the archangel
and the devil, when the celestial power argues with the
infernal in conversational French, as 'Eh bien! Satan,
crois-tu donc que notre Seigneur t'aurait expos&eacute; aux
tourments que t'endures &agrave; pr&eacute;sent, sans avoir pr&eacute;vu,'
&amp;c. &amp;c. are very ridiculous. All the supernatural personages
are alarmingly natural (as theatre nature goes),
and walk about in the stupidest way. Which has occasioned
Collins and myself to institute a perquisition
whether the French ever have shown any kind of idea
of the supernatural; and to decide this rather in the
negative. The people are very well dressed, and Eve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_131" id="Page_3_131">[131]</a></span>
very modestly. All Paris and the provinces had been
ransacked for a woman who had brown hair that would
fall to the calves of her legs&mdash;and she was found at last
at the Od&eacute;on. There was nothing attractive until the
4th act, when there was a pretty good scene of the
children of Cain dancing in, and desecrating, a temple,
while Abel and his family were hammering hard at the
Ark, outside; in all the pauses of the revel. The Deluge
in the fifth act was up to about the mark of a drowning
scene at the Adelphi; but it had one new feature.
When the rain ceased, and the ark drove in on the
great expanse of water, then lying waveless as the mists
cleared and the sun broke out, numbers of bodies
drifted up and down. These were all real men and
boys, each separate, on a new kind of horizontal sloat.
They looked horrible and real. Altogether, a merely
dull business; but I dare say it will go for a long
while."</p>

<p>A piece of honest farce is a relief from these profane
absurdities. "An uncommonly droll piece with an
original comic idea in it has been in course of representation
here. It is called <i>Les Cheveux de ma Femme</i>.
A man who is dotingly fond of his wife, and who
wishes to know whether she loved anybody else before
they were married, cuts off a lock of her hair by
stealth, and takes it to a great mesmeriser, who submits
it to a clairvoyante who never was wrong. It is discovered
that the owner of this hair has been up to the
most frightful dissipations, insomuch that the clairvoyante
can't mention half of them. The distracted
husband goes home to reproach his wife, and she then
reveals that she wears a wig, and takes it off."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_132" id="Page_3_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>The last piece he went to see before leaving Paris
was a French version of <i>As You Like It;</i> but he found
two acts of it to be more than enough. "In <i>Comme il
vous Plaira</i> nobody had anything to do but to sit down
as often as possible on as many stones and trunks of
trees as possible. When I had seen Jacques seat himself
on 17 roots of trees, and 25 grey stones, which was
at the end of the second act, I came away." Only
one more sketch taken in a theatre, and perhaps the
best, I will give from these letters. It simply tells us
what is necessary to understand a particular "tag" to
a play, but it is related so prettily that the thing it
celebrates could not have a nicer effect than is produced
by this account of it. The play in question, <i>M&eacute;moires
du Diable</i>, and another piece of enchanting interest,
the <i>M&eacute;decin des Enfants</i>,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> were his favourites among
all he saw at this time. "As I have no news, I may
as well tell you about the tag that I thought so pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_133" id="Page_3_133">[133]</a></span>
to the <i>M&eacute;moires du Diable;</i> in which piece by the way,
there is a most admirable part, most admirably played,
in which a man says merely 'Yes' or 'No' all through
the piece, until the last scene. A certain M. Robin
has got hold of the papers of a deceased lawyer, concerning
a certain estate which has been swindled away
from its rightful owner, a Baron's widow, into other
hands. They disclose so much roguery that he binds
them up into a volume lettered 'M&eacute;moires du Diable.'
The knowledge he derives from these papers not only
enables him to unmask the hypocrites all through the
piece (in an excellent manner), but induces him to
propose to the Baroness that if he restores to her her
estate and good name&mdash;for even her marriage to the
deceased Baron is denied&mdash;she shall give him her
daughter in marriage. The daughter herself, on hearing
the offer, accepts it; and a part of the plot is, her
going to a masked ball, to which he goes as the Devil,
to see how she likes him (when she finds, of course,
that she likes him very much). The country people
about the Ch&acirc;teau in dispute, suppose him to be really
the Devil, because of his strange knowledge, and his
strange comings and goings; and he, being with this
girl in one of its old rooms, in the beginning of the
3rd act, shews her a little coffer on the table with a
bell in it. 'They suppose,' he tells her, 'that whenever
this bell is rung, I appear and obey the summons.
Very ignorant, isn't it? But, if you ever want me
particularly&mdash;very particularly&mdash;ring the little bell and
try.' The plot proceeds to its development. The
wrong-doers are exposed; the missing document, proving
the marriage, is found; everything is finished; they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_134" id="Page_3_134">[134]</a></span>
are all on the stage; and M. Robin hands the paper
to the Baroness. 'You are reinstated in your rights,
Madame; you are happy; I will not hold you to a
compact made when you didn't know me; I release
you and your fair daughter; the pleasure of doing what
I have done, is my sufficient reward; I kiss your hand
and take my leave. Farewell!' He backs himself
courteously out; the piece seems concluded, everybody
wonders, the girl (little Mdlle. Luther) stands amazed;
when she suddenly remembers the little bell. In the
prettiest way possible, she runs to the coffer on the
table, takes out the little bell, rings it, and he comes
rushing back and folds her to his heart. I never saw
a prettier thing in my life. It made me laugh in that
most delightful of ways, with the tears in my eyes; so
that I can never forget it, and must go and see it
again."</p>

<p>But great as was the pleasure thus derived from the
theatre, he was, in the matter of social intercourse,
even more indebted to distinguished men connected
with it by authorship or acting. At Scribe's he was
entertained frequently; and "very handsome and
pleasant" was his account of the dinners, as of all the
belongings, of the prolific dramatist&mdash;a charming place
in Paris, a fine estate in the country, capital carriage,
handsome pair of horses, "all made, as he says, by his
pen." One of the guests the first evening was Auber,
"a stolid little elderly man, rather petulant in manner,"
who told Dickens he had once lived "at Stock Noonton"
(Stoke Newington) to study English, but had
forgotten it all. "Louis Philippe had invited him to
meet the Queen of England, and when L. P. presented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_135" id="Page_3_135">[135]</a></span>
him, the Queen said, 'We are such old acquaintances
through M. Auber's works, that an introduction is
quite unnecessary.'" They met again a few nights
later, with the author of the <i>History of the Girondins</i>,
at the hospitable table of M. Pichot, to whom Lamartine
had expressed a strong desire again to meet Dickens
as "un des grands amis de son imagination." "He
continues to be precisely as we formerly knew him,
both in appearance and manner; highly prepossessing,
and with a sort of calm passion about him, very taking
indeed. We talked of De Foe<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> and Richardson, and
of that wonderful genius for the minutest details in a
narrative, which has given them so much fame in
France. I found him frank and unaffected, and full
of curious knowledge of the French common people.
He informed the company at dinner that he had rarely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_136" id="Page_3_136">[136]</a></span>
met a foreigner who spoke French so easily as your
inimitable correspondent, whereat your correspondent
blushed modestly, and almost immediately afterwards
so nearly choked himself with the bone of a fowl (which
is still in his throat), that he sat in torture for ten
minutes with a strong apprehension that he was going
to make the good Pichot famous by dying like the
little Hunchback at his table. Scribe and his wife
were of the party, but had to go away at the ice-time
because it was the first representation at the Op&eacute;ra
Comique of a new opera by Auber and himself, of
which very great expectations have been formed. It
was very curious to see him&mdash;the author of 400 pieces&mdash;getting
nervous as the time approached, and pulling
out his watch every minute. At last he dashed out as
if he were going into what a friend of mine calls a
plunge-bath. Whereat she rose and followed. She is
the most extraordinary woman I ever beheld; for her
eldest son must be thirty, and she has the figure of
five-and-twenty, and is strikingly handsome. So graceful
too, that her manner of rising, curtseying, laughing,
and going out after him, was pleasanter than the pleasantest
thing I have ever seen done on the stage." The
opera Dickens himself saw a week later, and wrote of it
as "most charming. Delightful music, an excellent
story, immense stage tact, capital scenic arrangements,
and the most delightful little prima donna ever seen
or heard, in the person of Marie Cabel. It is called
<i>Manon Lescaut</i>&mdash;from the old romance&mdash;and is charming
throughout. She sings a laughing song in it which
is received with madness, and which is the only real
laughing song that ever was written. Auber told me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_137" id="Page_3_137">[137]</a></span>
that when it was first rehearsed, it made a great effect
upon the orchestra; and that he could not have had a
better compliment upon its freshness than the musical
director paid him, in coming and clapping him on the
shoulder with 'Bravo, jeune homme! Cela promet
bien!'"</p>

<p>At dinner at Regnier's he met M. Legouvet, in
whose tragedy Rachel, after its acceptance, had refused
to act Medea; a caprice which had led not only to her
condemnation in costs of so much a night until she did
act it, but to a quasi rivalry against her by Ristori, who
was now on her way to Paris to play it in Italian. To
this performance Dickens and Macready subsequently
went together, and pronounced it to be hopelessly bad.
"In the day <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'entertaiments'">entertainments</ins>, and little melodrama theatres,
of Italy, I have seen the same thing fifty times,
only not at once so conventional and so exaggerated.
The papers have all been in fits respecting the sublimity
of the performance, and the genuineness of the applause&mdash;particularly
of the bouquets; which were thrown on
at the most preposterous times in the midst of agonizing
scenes, so that the characters had to pick their way
among them, and a certain stout gentleman who played
King Creon was obliged to keep a wary eye, all night,
on the proscenium boxes, and dodge them as they
came down. Now Scribe, who dined here next day
(and who follows on the Ristori side, being offended,
as everybody has been, by the insolence of Rachel),
could not resist the temptation of telling us, that, going
round at the end of the first act to offer his congratulations,
he met all the bouquets coming back in men's
arms to be thrown on again in the second act.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_138" id="Page_3_138">[138]</a></span>
By the bye, I see a fine actor lost in Scribe. In all his
pieces he has everything done in his own way; and on
that same night he was showing what Rachel did not
do, and wouldn't do, in the last scene of Adrienne
Lecouvreur, with extraordinary force and intensity."</p>

<p>At the house of another great artist, Madame Viardot,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
the sister of Malibran, Dickens dined to meet
Georges Sands, that lady having appointed the day and
hour for the interesting festival, which came off duly
on the 10th of January. "I suppose it to be impossible
to imagine anybody more unlike my preconceptions
than the illustrious Sand. Just the kind of woman in
appearance whom you might suppose to be the Queen's
monthly nurse. Chubby, matronly, swarthy, black-eyed.
Nothing of the blue-stocking about her, except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_139" id="Page_3_139">[139]</a></span>
a little final way of settling all your opinions with hers,
which I take to have been acquired in the country
where she lives, and in the domination of a small circle.
A singularly ordinary woman in appearance and manner.
The dinner was very good and remarkably
unpretending. Ourselves, Madame and her son, the
Scheffers, the Sartorises, and some Lady somebody
(from the Crimea last) who wore a species of paletot,
and smoked. The Viardots have a house away in the
new part of Paris, which looks exactly as if they had
moved into it last week and were going away next.
Notwithstanding which, they have lived in it eight
years. The opera the very last thing on earth you
would associate with the family. Piano not even
opened. Her husband is an extremely good fellow,
and she is as natural as it is possible to be."</p>

<p>Dickens was hardly the man to take fair measure of
Madame Dudevant in meeting her thus. He was not
familiar with her writings, and had no very special
liking for such of them as he knew. But no disappointment,
nothing but amazement, awaited him at a
dinner that followed soon after. Emile de Girardin
gave a banquet in his honour. His description of it,
which he declares to be strictly prosaic, sounds a little
Oriental, but not inappropriately so. "No man unacquainted
with my determination never to embellish
or fancify such accounts, could believe in the description
I shall let off when we meet of dining at Emile
Girardin's&mdash;of the three gorgeous drawing rooms with
ten thousand wax candles in golden sconces, terminating
in a dining-room of unprecedented magnificence
with two enormous transparent plate-glass doors in it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_140" id="Page_3_140">[140]</a></span>
looking (across an ante-chamber full of clean plates)
straight into the kitchen, with the cooks in their white
paper caps dishing the dinner. From his seat in the
midst of the table, the host (like a Giant in a Fairy
story) beholds the kitchen, and the snow-white tables,
and the profound order and silence there prevailing.
Forth from the plate-glass doors issues the Banquet&mdash;the
most wonderful feast ever tasted by mortal: at the
present price of Truffles, that article alone costing (for
eight people) at least five pounds. On the table are
ground glass jugs of peculiar construction, laden with
the finest growth of Champagne and the coolest ice.
With the third course is issued Port Wine (previously
unheard of in a good state on this continent), which
would fetch two guineas a bottle at any sale. The
dinner done, Oriental flowers in vases of golden cobweb
are placed upon the board. With the ice is issued
Brandy, buried for 100 years. To that succeeds Coffee,
brought by the brother of one of the convives from the
remotest East, in exchange for an equal quantity of
California gold dust. The company being returned to
the drawing-room&mdash;tables roll in by unseen agency,
laden with Cigarettes from the Hareem of the Sultan,
and with cool drinks in which the flavour of the Lemon
arrived yesterday from Algeria, struggles voluptuously
with the delicate Orange arrived this morning from
Lisbon. That period past, and the guests reposing on
Divans worked with many-coloured blossoms, big table
rolls in, heavy with massive furniture of silver, and
breathing incense in the form of a little present of
Tea direct from China&mdash;table and all, I believe; but
cannot swear to it, and am resolved to be prosaic. All<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_141" id="Page_3_141">[141]</a></span>
this time the host perpetually repeats 'Ce petit d&icirc;ner-ci
n'est que pour faire la connaissance de Monsieur Dickens;
il ne compte pas; ce n'est rien.' And even now
I have forgotten to set down half of it&mdash;in particular
the item of a far larger plum pudding than ever was
seen in England at Christmas time, served with a
celestial sauce in colour like the orange blossom, and
in substance like the blossom powdered and bathed in
dew, and called in the carte (carte in a gold frame like
a little fish-slice to be handed about) 'Hommage &agrave;
l'illustre &eacute;crivain d'Angleterre.' That illustrious man
staggered out at the last drawing-room door, speechless
with wonder, finally; and even at that moment his host,
holding to his lips a chalice set with precious stones and
containing nectar distilled from the air that blew over
the fields of beans in bloom for fifteen summers, remarked
'Le <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'diner'">d&icirc;ner</ins> que nous avons eu, mon cher, n'est
rien&mdash;il ne compte pas&mdash;il a &eacute;t&eacute; tout-&agrave;-fait en famille&mdash;il
faut d&icirc;ner (en v&eacute;rit&eacute;, d&icirc;ner) bient&ocirc;t. Au plaisir!
Au revoir! Au d&icirc;ner!'"</p>

<p>The second dinner came, wonderful as the first;
among the company were Regnier, Jules Sandeau, and
the new Director of the Fran&ccedil;ais; and his host again
played Lucullus in the same style, with success even
more consummate. The only absolutely new incident
however was that "After dinner he asked me if I
would come into another room and smoke a cigar?
and on my saying Yes, coolly opened a drawer, containing
about 5000 inestimable cigars in prodigious
bundles&mdash;just as the Captain of the Robbers in <i>Ali
Baba</i> might have gone to a corner of the cave for
bales of brocade. A little man dined who was blacking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_142" id="Page_3_142">[142]</a></span>
shoes 8 years ago, and is now enormously rich&mdash;the
richest man in Paris&mdash;having ascended with
rapidity up the usual ladder of the Bourse. By merely
observing that perhaps he might come down again, I
clouded so many faces as to render it very clear to me
that <i>everybody present</i> was at the same game for some
stake or other!" He returned to that subject in a letter
a few days later. "If you were to see the steps of
the Bourse at about 4 in the afternoon, and the crowd
of blouses and patches among the speculators there
assembled, all howling and haggard with speculation,
you would stand aghast at the consideration of what
must be going on. Concierges and people like that
perpetually blow their brains out, or fly into the Seine,
'&agrave; cause des pertes sur la Bourse.' I hardly ever
take up a French paper without lighting on such a
paragraph. On the other hand, thoroughbred horses
without end, and red velvet carriages with white kid
harness on jet black horses, go by here all day long;
and the pedestrians who turn to look at them, laugh,
and say 'C'est la Bourse!' Such crashes must be
staved off every week as have not been seen since
Law's time."</p>

<p>Another picture connects itself with this, and throws
light on the speculation thus raging. The French loans
connected with the war, so much puffed and praised in
England at the time for the supposed spirit in which
they were taken up, had in fact only ministered to the
commonest and lowest gambling; and the war had
never in the least been popular. "Emile Girardin,"
wrote Dickens on the 23rd of March, "was here yesterday,
and he says that Peace is to be formally announced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_143" id="Page_3_143">[143]</a></span>
at Paris to-morrow amid general apathy." But the
French are never wholly apathetic to their own exploits;
and a display with a touch of excitement in
it had been witnessed a couple of months before on
the entry of the troops from the Crimea,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> when the
Zouaves, as they marched past, pleased Dickens most.
"A remarkable body of men," he wrote, "wild, dangerous,
and picturesque. Close-cropped head, red skull
cap, Greek jacket, full red petticoat trowsers trimmed
with yellow, and high white gaiters&mdash;the most sensible
things for the purpose I know, and coming into use in
the line. A man with such things on his legs is always
free there, and ready for a muddy march; and might
flounder through roads two feet deep in mud, and,
simply by changing his gaiters (he has another pair in
his haversack), be clean and comfortable and wholesome
again, directly. Plenty of beard and moustache,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_144" id="Page_3_144">[144]</a></span>
and the musket carried reverse-wise with the stock over
the shoulder, make up the sunburnt Zouave. He strides
like Bobadil, smoking as he goes; and when he laughs
(they were under my window for half-an-hour or so),
plunges backward in the wildest way, as if he were
going to throw a sommersault. They have a black
dog belonging to the regiment, and, when they now
marched along with their medals, this dog marched
after the one non-commissioned officer he invariably
follows with a profound conviction that he was decorated.
I couldn't see whether he had a medal, his
hair being long; but he was perfectly up to what had
befallen his regiment; and I never saw anything so
capital as his way of regarding the public. Whatever
the regiment does, he is always in his place; and it was
impossible to mistake the air of modest triumph which
was now upon him. A small dog corporeally, but of a
great mind."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> On that night there was an illumination
in honour of the army, when the "whole of Paris, bye
streets and lanes and all sorts of out of the way places,
was most brilliantly illuminated. It looked in the dark
like Venice and Genoa rolled into one, and split up
through the middle by the Corso at Rome in the carnival
time. The French people certainly do know how
to honour their own countrymen, in a most marvellous
way." It was the festival time of the New Year, and
Dickens was fairly lost in a mystery of amazement at
where the money could come from that everybody was
spending on the &eacute;trennes they were giving to everybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_145" id="Page_3_145">[145]</a></span>
else. All the famous shops on the Boulevards had been
blockaded for more than a week. "There is now a line
of wooden stalls, three miles long, on each side of that
immense thoroughfare; and wherever a retiring house
or two admits of a double line, there it is. All sorts
of objects from shoes and sabots, through porcelain and
crystal, up to live fowls and rabbits which are played
for at a sort of dwarf skittles (to their immense disturbance,
as the ball rolls under them and shakes them off
their shelves and perches whenever it is delivered by a
vigorous hand), are on sale in this great Fair. And
what you may get in the way of ornament for two-pence,
is astounding." Unhappily there came dark
and rainy weather, and one of the improvements of
the Empire ended, as so many others did, in slush and
misery.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_146" id="Page_3_146">[146]</a></span></p><p>Some sketches connected with the Art Exposition in
the winter of 1855, and with the fulfilment of Ary
Scheffer's design to paint the portrait of Dickens, may
close these Paris pictures. He did not think that English
art showed to advantage beside the French. It
seemed to him small, shrunken, insignificant, "niggling."
He thought the general absence of ideas
horribly apparent; "and even when one comes to
Mulready, and sees two old men talking over a much-too-prominent
table-cloth, and reads the French explanation
of their proceedings, 'La discussion sur les
principes de Docteur Whiston,' one is dissatisfied.
Somehow or other they don't tell. Even Leslie's Sancho
wants go, and Stanny is too much like a set-scene.
It is of no use disguising the fact that what we know
to be wanting in the men is wanting in their works&mdash;character,
fire, purpose, and the power of using the
vehicle and the model as mere means to an end. There
is a horrible respectability about most of the best of
them&mdash;a little, finite, systematic routine in them,
strangely expressive to me of the state of England
itself. As a mere fact, Frith, Ward, and Egg, come out
the best in such pictures as are here, and attract to the
greatest extent. The first, in the picture from the
Good-natured Man; the second, in the Royal Family
in the Temple; the third, in the Peter the Great first
seeing Catherine&mdash;which I always thought a good picture,
and in which foreigners evidently descry a sudden
dramatic touch that pleases them. There are no end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_147" id="Page_3_147">[147]</a></span>
of bad pictures among the French, but, Lord! the
goodness also!&mdash;the fearlessness of them; the bold
drawing; the dashing conception; the passion and
action in them!<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The Belgian department is full of
merit. It has the best landscape in it, the best portrait,
and the best scene of homely life, to be found in
the building. Don't think it a part of my despondency
about public affairs, and my fear that our national glory
is on the decline, when I say that mere form and conventionalities
usurp, in English art, as in English government
and social relations, the place of living force
and truth. I tried to resist the impression yesterday,
and went to the English gallery first, and praised and
admired with great diligence; but it was of no use. I
could not make anything better of it than what I tell
you. Of course this is between ourselves. Friendship
is better than criticism, and I shall steadily hold my
tongue. Discussion is worse than useless when you
cannot agree about what you are going to discuss."
French nature is all wrong, said the English artists
whom Dickens talked to; but surely not because it is
French, was his reply. The English point of view is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_148" id="Page_3_148">[148]</a></span>
not the only one to take men and women from. The
French pictures are "theatrical," was the rejoinder.
But the French themselves are a demonstrative and
gesticulating people, was Dickens's retort; and what
thus is rendered by their artists is the truth through an
immense part of the world. "I never saw anything so
strange. They seem to me to have got a fixed idea that
there is no natural manner but the English manner (in
itself so exceptional that it is a thing apart, in all countries);
and that unless a Frenchman&mdash;represented as
going to the guillotine for example&mdash;is as calm as Clapham,
or as respectable as Richmond-hill, he cannot be
right."</p>

<p>To the sittings at Ary Scheffer's some troubles as
well as many pleasures were incident, and both had
mention in his letters. "You may faintly imagine
what I have suffered from sitting to Scheffer every day
since I came back. He is a most noble fellow, and I
have the greatest pleasure in his society, and have made
all sorts of acquaintances at his house; but I can
scarcely express how uneasy and unsettled it makes me
to have to sit, sit, sit, with <i>Little Dorrit</i> on my mind,
and the Christmas business too&mdash;though that is now
happily dismissed. On Monday afternoon, <i>and all
day on Wednesday</i>, I am going to sit again. And the
crowning feature is, that I do not discern the slightest
resemblance, either in his portrait or his brother's!
They both peg away at me at the same time." The
sittings were varied by a special entertainment, when
Scheffer received some sixty people in his "long
atelier"&mdash;"including a lot of French who <i>say</i> (but I
don't believe it) that they know English"&mdash;to whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_149" id="Page_3_149">[149]</a></span>
Dickens, by special entreaty, read his <i>Cricket on the
Hearth</i>.</p>

<p>That was at the close of November. January came,
and the end of the sittings was supposed to be at hand.
"The nightmare portrait is nearly done; and Scheffer
promises that an interminable sitting next Saturday,
beginning at 10 o'clock in the morning, shall finish it.
It is a fine spirited head, painted at his very best, and
with a very easy and natural appearance in it. But it
does not look to me at all like, nor does it strike me
that if I saw it in a gallery I should suppose myself to
be the original. It is always possible that I don't
know my own face. It is going to be engraved here,
in two sizes and ways&mdash;the mere head and the whole
thing." A fortnight later, the interminable sitting
came. "Imagine me if you please with No. 5 on my
head and hands, sitting to Scheffer yesterday four
hours! At this stage of a story, no one can conceive
how it distresses me." Still this was not the last.
March had come before the portrait was done.
"Scheffer finished yesterday; and Collins, who has a
good eye for pictures, says that there is no man living
who could do the painting about the eyes. As a work
of art I see in it spirit combined with perfect ease,
and yet I don't see myself. So I come to the conclusion
that I never <i>do</i> see myself. I shall be very
curious to know the effect of it upon you." March
had then begun; and at its close Dickens, who had
meanwhile been in England, thus wrote: "I have not
seen Scheffer since I came back, but he told Catherine
a few days ago that he was not satisfied with the likeness
after all, and thought he must do more to it. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_150" id="Page_3_150">[150]</a></span>
own impression of it, you remember?" In these few
words he anticipated the impression made upon myself.
I was not satisfied with it. The picture had
much merit, but not as a portrait. From its very resemblance
in the eyes and mouth one derived the
sense of a general unlikeness. But the work of the
artist's brother, Henri Scheffer, painted from the same
sittings, was in all ways greatly inferior.</p>

<p>Before Dickens left Paris in May he had sent over
two descriptions that the reader most anxious to follow
him to a new scene would perhaps be sorry to lose. A
Duchess was murdered in the Champs Elys&eacute;es. "The
murder over the way (the third or fourth event of that
nature in the Champs Elys&eacute;es since we have been here)
seems to disclose the strangest state of things. The
Duchess who is murdered lived alone in a great house
which was always shut up, and passed her time entirely
in the dark. In a little lodge outside lived a coachman
(the murderer), and there had been a long succession
of coachmen who had been unable to stay there, and
upon whom, whenever they asked for their wages, she
plunged out with an immense knife, by way of an immediate
settlement. The coachman never had anything
to do, for the coach hadn't been driven out for years;
neither would she ever allow the horses to be taken out
for exercise. Between the lodge and the house, is a
miserable bit of garden, all overgrown with long rank
grass, weeds, and nettles; and in this, the horses used
to be taken out to swim&mdash;in a dead green vegetable sea,
up to their haunches. On the day of the murder, there
was a great crowd, of course; and in the midst of it up
comes the Duke her husband (from whom she was separated),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_151" id="Page_3_151">[151]</a></span>
and rings at the gate. The police open the
grate. 'C'est vrai donc,' says the Duke, 'que Madame
la Duchesse n'est plus?'&mdash;'C'est trop vrai, Monseigneur.'&mdash;'Tant
mieux,' says the Duke, and walks off
deliberately, to the great satisfaction of the assemblage."</p>

<p>The second description relates an occurrence in England
of only three years previous date, belonging to
that wildly improbable class of realities which Dickens
always held, with Fielding, to be (properly) closed to
fiction. Only, he would add, critics should not be so
eager to assume that what had never happened to themselves
could not, by any human possibility, ever be
supposed to have happened to anybody else. "B. was
with me the other day, and, among other things that
he told me, described an extraordinary adventure in his
life, at a place not a thousand miles from my 'property'
at Gadshill, three years ago. He lived at the tavern
and was sketching one day when an open carriage came
by with a gentleman and lady in it. He was sitting in
the same place working at the same sketch, next day,
when it came by again. So, another day, when the
gentleman got out and introduced himself. Fond of
art; lived at the great house yonder, which perhaps he
knew; was an Oxford man and a Devonshire squire,
but not resident on his estate, for domestic reasons;
would be glad to see him to dinner to-morrow. He
went, and found among other things a very fine library.
'At your disposition,' said the Squire, to whom he had
now described himself and his pursuits. 'Use it for
your writing and drawing. Nobody else uses it.' He
stayed in the house <i>six months</i>. The lady was a mistress,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_152" id="Page_3_152">[152]</a></span>
aged five-and-twenty, and very beautiful, drinking
her life away. The Squire was drunken, and utterly
depraved and wicked; but an excellent scholar, an admirable
linguist, and a great theologian. Two other
mad visitors stayed the six months. One, a man well
known in Paris here, who goes about the world with a
crimson silk stocking in his breast pocket, containing a
tooth-brush and an immense quantity of ready money.
The other, a college chum of the Squire's, now ruined;
with an insatiate thirst for drink; who constantly got
up in the middle of the night, crept down to the
dining-room, and emptied all the decanters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. B.
stayed on in the place, under a sort of devilish fascination
to discover what might come of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Tea or
coffee never seen in the house, and very seldom water.
Beer, champagne, and brandy, were the three drinkables.
Breakfast: leg of mutton, champagne, beer,
and brandy. Lunch: shoulder of mutton, champagne,
beer, and brandy. Dinner: every conceivable dish
(Squire's income, &pound;7,000 a-year), champagne, beer,
and brandy. The Squire had married a woman of the
town from whom he was now separated, but by whom
he had a daughter. The mother, to spite the father,
had bred the daughter in every conceivable vice.
Daughter, then 13, came from school once a month.
Intensely coarse in talk, and always drunk. As they
drove about the country in two open carriages, the
drunken mistress would be perpetually tumbling out of
one, and the drunken daughter perpetually tumbling
out of the other. At last the drunken mistress drank
her stomach away, and began to die on the sofa. Got
worse and worse, and was always raving about Somebody's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_153" id="Page_3_153">[153]</a></span>
where she had once been a lodger, and perpetually
shrieking that she would cut somebody else's heart
out. At last she died on the sofa, and, after the funeral,
the party broke up. A few months ago, B. met the
man with the crimson silk stocking at Brighton, who
told him that the Squire was dead 'of a broken heart';
that the chum was dead of delirium tremens; and that
the daughter was heiress to the fortune. He told me
all this, which I fully believe to be true, without any
embellishment&mdash;just in the off-hand way in which I
have told it to you."</p>

<p>Dickens left Paris at the end of April, and, after the
summer in Boulogne which has been described, passed
the winter in London, giving to his theatrical enterprise
nearly all the time that <i>Little Dorrit</i> did not claim from
him. His book was finished in the following spring;
was inscribed to Clarkson Stanfield; and now claims to
have something said about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Between</span> <i>Hard Times</i> and <i>Little Dorrit</i>, Dickens's
principal literary work had been the contribution to
<i>Household Words</i> of two tales for Christmas (1854 and
1855) which his readings afterwards made widely popular,
the Story of Richard Doubledick,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and Boots at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_155" id="Page_3_155">[155]</a></span>
the Holly-Tree Inn. In the latter was related, with a
charming naturalness and spirit, the elopement, to get
married at Gretna Green, of two little children of the
mature respective ages of eight and seven. At Christmas
1855 came out the first number of <i>Little Dorrit</i>,
and in April 1857 the last.</p>

<p>The book took its origin from the notion he had of
a leading man for a story who should bring about all
the mischief in it, lay it all on Providence, and say at
every fresh calamity, "Well it's a mercy, however,
nobody was to blame you know!" The title first
chosen, out of many suggested, was <i>Nobody's Fault;</i>
and four numbers had been written, of which the first
was on the eve of appearance, before this was changed.
When about to fall to work he excused himself from
an engagement he should have kept because "the story
is breaking out all round me, and I am going off down
the railroad to humour it." The humouring was a
little difficult, however; and such indications of a
droop in his invention as presented themselves in portions
of <i>Bleak House</i>, were noticeable again. "As to
the story I am in the second number, and last night
and this morning had half a mind to begin again, and
work in what I have done, afterwards." It had occurred
to him, that, by making the fellow-travellers at
once known to each other, as the opening of the story
stands, he had missed an effect. "It struck me that it
would be a new thing to show people coming together,
in a chance way, as fellow-travellers, and being in the
same place, ignorant of one another, as happens in
life; and to connect them afterwards, and to make the
waiting for that connection a part of the interest."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_156" id="Page_3_156">[156]</a></span>
The change was not made; but the mention of it was
one of several intimations to me of the altered conditions
under which he was writing, and that the old,
unstinted, irrepressible flow of fancy had received temporary
check. In this view I have found it very interesting
to compare the original notes, which as usual he
prepared for each number of the tale, and which with
the rest are in my possession, with those of <i>Chuzzlewit</i>
or <i>Copperfield;</i> observing in the former the labour and
pains, and in the latter the lightness and confidence of
handling.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> "I am just now getting to work on number
three: sometimes enthusiastic, more often dull
enough. There is an enormous outlay in the Father
of the Marshalsea chapter, in the way of getting a great
lot of matter into a small space. I am not quite resolved,
but I have a great idea of overwhelming that
family with wealth. Their condition would be very
curious. I can make Dorrit very strong in the story, I
hope." The Marshalsea part of the tale undoubtedly
was excellent, and there was masterly treatment of
character in the contrasts of the brothers Dorrit; but
of the family generally it may be said that its least important
members had most of his genius in them. The
younger of the brothers, the scapegrace son, and
"Fanny dear," are perfectly real people in what makes
them unattractive; but what is meant for attractiveness in
the heroine becomes often tiresome by want of reality.</p>

<p>The first number appeared in December 1855, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_159" id="Page_3_159">[159]</a></span>
on the 2nd there was an exultant note. "<i>Little Dorrit</i>
has beaten even <i>Bleak House</i> out of the field. It
is a most tremendous start, and I am overjoyed at it;"
to which he added, writing from Paris on the 6th of
the month following, "You know that they had sold
35,000 of number two on new year's day." He was
still in Paris on the day of the appearance of that portion
of the tale by which it will always be most vividly
remembered, and thus wrote on the 30th of January
1856: "I have a grim pleasure upon me to-night in
thinking that the Circumlocution Office sees the light,
and in wondering what effect it will make. But my
head really stings with the visions of the book, and I
am going, as we French say, to disembarrass it by
plunging out into some of the strange places I glide
into of nights in these latitudes." The Circumlocution
heroes led to the Society scenes, the Hampton-court
dowager-sketches, and Mr. Gowan; all parts of one
satire levelled against prevailing political and social
vices. Aim had been taken, in the course of it, at
some living originals, disguised sufficiently from recognition
to enable him to make his thrust more sure;
but there was one exception self-revealed. "I had the
general idea," he wrote while engaged on the sixth
number, "of the Society business before the Sadleir
affair, but I shaped Mr. Merdle himself out of that
precious rascality. Society, the Circumlocution Office,
and Mr. Gowan, are of course three parts of one idea
and design. Mr. Merdle's complaint, which you will
find in the end to be fraud and forgery, came into my
mind as the last drop in the silver cream-jug on Hampstead-heath.
I shall beg, when you have read the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_160" id="Page_3_160">[160]</a></span>
present number, to enquire whether you consider 'Bar'
an instance, in reference to K F, of a suggested likeness
in not many touches!" The likeness no one
could mistake; and, though that particular Bar has
since been moved into a higher and happier sphere,
Westminster-hall is in no danger of losing "the insinuating
Jury-droop, and persuasive double-eyeglass,"
by which this keen observer could express a type of
character in half a dozen words.</p>

<p>Of the other portions of the book that had a strong
personal interest for him I have spoken on a former
page, and I will now only add an allusion of his own.
"There are some things in Flora in number seven that
seem to me to be extraordinarily droll, with something
serious at the bottom of them after all. Ah, well!
was there <i>not</i> something very serious in it once? I am
glad to think of being in the country with the long
summer mornings as I approach number ten, where I
have finally resolved to make Dorrit rich. It should
be a very fine point in the story.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nothing in Flora
made me laugh so much as the confusion of ideas
between gout flying upwards, and its soaring with Mr.
F&mdash;&mdash; to another sphere." He had himself no inconsiderable
enjoyment also of Mr. F.'s aunt; and in the
old rascal of a patriarch, the smooth-surfaced Casby,
and other surroundings of poor Flora, there was fun
enough to float an argosy of second-rates, assuming
such to have formed the staple of the tale. It would
be far from fair to say they did. The defect in the
book was less the absence of excellent character or
keen observation, than the want of ease and coherence
among the figures of the story, and of a central interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_161" id="Page_3_161">[161]</a></span>
in the plan of it. The agencies that bring about
its catastrophe, too, are less agreeable even than in
<i>Bleak House;</i> and, most unlike that well-constructed
story, some of the most deeply considered things that
occur in it have really little to do with the tale itself.
The surface-painting of both Miss Wade and Tattycoram,
to take an instance, is anything but attractive,
yet there is under it a rare force of likeness in the
unlikeness between the two which has much subtlety
of intention; and they must both have had, as well as
Mr. Gowan himself, a striking effect in the novel, if
they had been made to contribute in a more essential
way to its interest or development. The failure nevertheless
had not been for want of care and study, as
well of his own design as of models by masters in his
art. A happier hint of apology, for example, could
hardly be given for Fielding's introduction of such an
episode as the Man of the Hill between the youth and
manhood of Blifil and Tom Jones, than is suggested
by what Dickens wrote of the least interesting part of
<i>Little Dorrit</i>. In the mere form, Fielding of course
was only following the lead of Cervantes and Le Sage;
but Dickens rightly judged his purpose also to have
been, to supply a kind of connection between the episode
and the story. "I don't see the practicability of
making the History of a Self-Tormentor, with which I
took great pains, a written narrative. But I do see the
possibility" (he saw the other practicability before the
number was published) "of making it a chapter by
itself, which might enable me to dispense with the
necessity of the turned commas. Do you think that
would be better? I have no doubt that a great part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_162" id="Page_3_162">[162]</a></span>
Fielding's reason for the introduced story, and Smollett's
also, was, that it is sometimes really impossible
to present, in a full book, the idea it contains (which
yet it may be on all accounts desirable to present),
without supposing the reader to be possessed of almost
as much romantic allowance as would put him on a
level with the writer. In Miss Wade I had an idea,
which I thought a new one, of making the introduced
story so fit into surroundings impossible of separation
from the main story, as to make the blood of the book
circulate through both. But I can only suppose, from
what you say, that I have not exactly succeeded in this."</p>

<p>Shortly after the date of his letter he was in London
on business connected with the purchase of Gadshill
Place, and he went over to the Borough to see what
traces were left of the prison of which his first impression
was taken in his boyhood, which had played so important
a part in this latest novel, and every brick and
stone of which he had been able to rebuild in his book
by the mere vividness of his marvellous memory.
"Went to the Borough yesterday morning before
going to Gadshill, to see if I could find any ruins of
the Marshalsea. Found a great part of the original
building&mdash;now 'Marshalsea Place.' Found the rooms
that have been in my mind's eye in the story. Found,
nursing a very big boy, a very small boy, who, seeing
me standing on the Marshalsea pavement, looking
about, told me how it all used to be. God knows how
he learned it (for he was a world too young to know
anything about it), but he was right enough.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There
is a room there&mdash;still standing, to my amazement&mdash;that
I think of taking! It is the room through which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_163" id="Page_3_163">[163]</a></span>
the ever-memorable signers of Captain Porter's petition
filed off in my boyhood. The spikes are gone, and
the wall is lowered, and anybody can go out now who
likes to go, and is not bedridden; and I said to the boy
'Who lives there?' and he said, 'Jack Pithick.' 'Who
is Jack Pithick?' I asked him. And he said, 'Joe
Pithick's uncle.'"</p>

<p>Mention was made of this visit in the preface that
appeared with the last number; and all it is necessary
to add of the completed book will be, that, though in
the humour and satire of its finer parts not unworthy
of him, and though it had the clear design, worthy of
him in an especial degree, of contrasting, both in private
and in public life, and in poverty equally as in
wealth, duty done and duty not done, it made no material
addition to his reputation. His public, however,
showed no falling-off in its enormous numbers; and
what is said in one of his letters, noticeable for this
touch of character, illustrates his anxiety to avoid any
set-off from the disquiet that critical discourtesies might
give. "I was ludicrously foiled here the other night
in a resolution I have kept for twenty years not to know
of any attack upon myself, by stumbling, before I
could pick myself up, on a short extract in the <i>Globe</i>
from <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, informing me that <i>Little
Dorrit</i> is 'Twaddle.' I was sufficiently put out by it
to be angry with myself for being such a fool, and
then pleased with myself for having so long been constant
to a good resolution." There was a scene that
made itself part of history not four months after his
death, which, if he could have lived to hear of it,
might have more than consoled him. It was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_164" id="Page_3_164">[164]</a></span>
meeting of Bismarck and Jules Favre under the walls
of Paris. The Prussian was waiting to open fire on the
city; the Frenchman was engaged in the arduous task
of showing the wisdom of not doing it; and "we
learn," say the papers of the day, "that while the two
eminent statesmen were trying to find a basis of negotiation,
Von Moltke was seated in a corner reading
<i>Little Dorrit</i>." Who will doubt that the chapter on
<span class="smcap">How Not to do it</span> was then absorbing the old soldier's
attention?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Preparations for the private play had gone on incessantly
up to Christmas, and, in turning the school-room
into a theatre, sawing and hammering worthy
of Babel continued for weeks. The priceless help of
Stanfield had again been secured, and I remember
finding him one day at Tavistock House in the act of
upsetting some elaborate arrangements by Dickens,
with a proscenium before him made up of chairs, and
the scenery planned out with walking-sticks. But
Dickens's art in a matter of this kind was to know
how to take advice; and no suggestion came to him
that he was not ready to act upon, if it presented the
remotest likelihood. In one of his great difficulties of
obtaining more space, for audience as well as actors,
he was told that Mr. Cooke of Astley's was a man of
much resource in that way; and to Mr. Cooke he
applied, with the following result. "One of the
finest things" (18th of October 1856) "I have ever
seen in my life of that kind was the arrival of my
friend Mr. Cooke one morning this week, in an open
phaeton drawn by two white ponies with black spots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_165" id="Page_3_165">[165]</a></span>
all over them (evidently stencilled), who came in at
the gate with a little jolt and a rattle, exactly as they
come into the Ring when they draw anything, and
went round and round the centre bed of the front
court, apparently looking for the clown. A multitude
of boys who felt them to be no common ponies rushed
up in a breathless state&mdash;twined themselves like ivy
about the railings&mdash;and were only deterred from storming
the enclosure by the glare of the Inimitable's eye.
Some of these boys had evidently followed from
Astley's. I grieve to add that my friend, being taken
to the point of difficulty, had no sort of suggestion in
him; no gleam of an idea; and might just as well have
been the popular minister from the Tabernacle in Tottenham
Court Road. All he could say was&mdash;answering
me, posed in the garden, precisely as if I were the
clown asking him a riddle at night&mdash;that two of their
stable tents would be home in November, and that they
were '20 foot square,' and I was heartily welcome to
'em. Also, he said, 'You might have half a dozen of
my trapezes, or my middle-distance-tables, but they're
all 6 foot and all too low sir.' Since then, I have
arranged to do it in my own way, and with my own
carpenter. You will be surprised by the look of the
place. It is no more like the school-room than it is
like the sign of the Salutation Inn at Ambleside in
Westmoreland. The sounds in the house remind me,
as to the present time, of Chatham Dockyard&mdash;as to a
remote epoch, of the building of Noah's ark. Joiners
are never out of the house, and the carpenter appears
to be unsettled (or settled) for life."</p>

<p>Of course time did not mend matters, and as Christmas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_166" id="Page_3_166">[166]</a></span>
approached the house was in a state of siege.
"All day long, a labourer heats size over the fire in a
great crucible. We eat it, drink it, breathe it, and
smell it. Seventy paint-pots (which came in a van)
adorn the stage; and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hereon'">thereon</ins> may be beheld, Stanny,
and three Dansons (from the Surrey Zoological Gardens),
all painting at once!! Meanwhile, Telbin, in a secluded
bower in Brewer-street, Golden-square, plies <i>his</i> part
of the little <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'under aking'">undertaking</ins>." How worthily it turned
out in the end, the excellence of the performances and
the delight of the audiences, became known to all
London; and the pressure for admittance at last took
the form of a tragi-comedy, composed of ludicrous
makeshifts and gloomy disappointments, with which
even Dickens's resources could not deal. "My audience
is now 93," he wrote one day in despair, "and
at least 10 will neither hear nor see." There was
nothing for it but to increase the number of nights;
and it was not until the 20th of January he described
"the workmen smashing the last atoms of the theatre."</p>

<p>His book was finished soon after at Gadshill Place,
to be presently described, which he had purchased the
previous year, and taken possession of in February;
subscribing himself, in the letter announcing the fact,
as "the Kentish Freeholder on his native heath, his
name Protection."<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The new abode occupied him in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_167" id="Page_3_167">[167]</a></span>
various ways in the early part of the summer; and
Hans Andersen the Dane had just arrived upon a visit
to him there, when Douglas Jerrold's unexpected death
befell. It was a shock to every one, and an especial
grief to Dickens. Jerrold's wit, and the bright shrewd
intellect that had so many triumphs, need no celebration
from me; but the keenest of satirists was one of
the kindliest of men, and Dickens had a fondness for
Jerrold as genuine as his admiration for him. "I
chance to know a good deal about the poor fellow's
illness, for I was with him on the last day he was out.
It was ten days ago, when we dined at a dinner given
by Russell at Greenwich. He was complaining much
when we met, said he had been sick three days, and
attributed it to the inhaling of white paint from his
study window. I did not think much of it at the
moment, as we were very social; but while we walked
through Leicester-square he suddenly fell into a white,
hot, sick perspiration, and had to lean against the
railings. Then, at my urgent request, he was to let
me put him in a cab and send him home; but he rallied
a little after that, and, on our meeting Russell, determined
to come with us. We three went down by
steamboat that we might see the great ship, and then
got an open fly and rode about Blackheath: poor
Jerrold mightily enjoying the air, and constantly
saying that it set him up. He was rather quiet at
dinner&mdash;sat next Delane&mdash;but was very humorous and
good, and in spirits, though he took hardly anything.
We parted with references to coming down here"
(Gadshill) "and I never saw him again. Next morning
he was taken very ill when he tried to get up. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_168" id="Page_3_168">[168]</a></span>
the Wednesday and Thursday he was very bad, but
rallied on the Friday, and was quite confident of
getting well. On the Sunday he was very ill again,
and on the Monday forenoon died; 'at peace with all
the world' he said, and asking to be remembered to
friends. He had become indistinct and insensible,
until for but a few minutes at the end. I knew nothing
about it, except that he had been ill and was better,
until, going up by railway yesterday morning, I heard
a man in the carriage, unfolding his newspaper, say to
another 'Douglas Jerrold is dead.' I immediately
went up there, and then to Whitefriars .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I propose
that there shall be a night at a theatre when the actors
(with old Cooke) shall play the <i>Rent Day</i> and <i>Black-ey'd
Susan;</i> another night elsewhere, with a lecture
from Thackeray; a day reading by me; a night reading
by me; a lecture by Russell; and a subscription performance
of the <i>Frozen Deep</i>, as at Tavistock House.
I don't mean to do it beggingly; but merely to
announce the whole series, the day after the funeral,
'In memory of the late Mr. Douglas Jerrold,' or some
such phrase. I have got hold of Arthur Smith as the
best man of business I know, and go to work with him
to-morrow morning&mdash;inquiries being made in the meantime
as to the likeliest places to be had for these
various purposes. My confident hope is that we shall
get close upon two thousand pounds."</p>

<p>The friendly enterprise was carried to the close with
a vigour, promptitude, and success, that well corresponded
with this opening. In addition to the performances
named, there were others in the country also
organized by Dickens, in which he took active personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_169" id="Page_3_169">[169]</a></span>
part; and the result did not fall short of his expectations.
The sum was invested ultimately for our friend's
unmarried daughter, who still receives the income from
myself, the last surviving trustee.</p>

<p>So passed the greater part of the summer,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and when
the country performances were over at the end of
August I had this intimation. "I have arranged with
Collins that he and I will start next Monday on a ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_170" id="Page_3_170">[170]</a></span>
or twelve days' expedition to out-of-the-way places, to
do (in inns and coast-corners) a little tour in search of
an article and in avoidance of railroads. I must get a
good name for it, and I propose it in five articles, one
for the beginning of every number in the October part."
Next day: "Our decision is for a foray upon the fells
of Cumberland; I having discovered in the books some
promising moors and bleak places thereabout." Into
the lake-country they went accordingly; and The Lazy
Tour of Two Idle Apprentices, contributed to <i>Household
Words</i>, was a narrative of the trip. But his letters
had descriptive touches, and some whimsical personal
experiences, not in the published account.</p>

<p>Looking over the <i>Beauties of England and Wales</i>
before he left London, his ambition was fired by mention
of Carrick Fell, "a gloomy old mountain 1500
feet high," which he secretly resolved to go up. "We
came straight to it yesterday" (9th of September).
"Nobody goes up. Guides have forgotten it. Master
of a little inn, excellent north-countryman, volunteered.
Went up, in a tremendous rain. C. D. beat Mr. Porter
(name of landlord) in half a mile. Mr. P. done up in
no time. Three nevertheless went on. Mr. P. again
leading; C. D. and C." (Mr. Wilkie Collins) "following.
Rain terrific, black mists, darkness of night. Mr.
P. agitated. C. D. confident. C. (a long way down
in perspective) submissive. All wet through. No
poles. Not so much as a walking-stick in the party.
Reach the summit, at about one in the day. Dead
darkness as of night. Mr. P. (excellent fellow to the
last) uneasy. C. D. produces compass from pocket.
Mr. P. reassured. Farm-house where dog-cart was left,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_171" id="Page_3_171">[171]</a></span>
N.N.W. Mr. P. complimentary. Descent commenced.
C. D. with compass triumphant, until compass, with the
heat and wet of C. D.'s pocket, breaks. Mr. P. (who
never had a compass), inconsolable, confesses he has
not been on Carrick Fell for twenty years, and he don't
know the way down. Darker and darker. Nobody
discernible, two yards off, by the other two. Mr. P.
makes suggestions, but no way. It becomes clear to
C. D. and to C. that Mr. P. is going round and round
the mountain, and never coming down. Mr. P. sits
on angular granite, and says he is 'just fairly doon.'
C. D. revives Mr. P. with laughter, the only restorative
in the company. Mr. P. again complimentary. Descent
tried once more. Mr. P. worse and worse. Council of
war. Proposals from C. D. to go 'slap down.' Seconded
by C. Mr. P. objects, on account of precipice called
The Black Arches, and terror of the country-side.
More wandering. Mr. P. terror-stricken, but game.
Watercourse, thundering and roaring, reached. C. D.
suggests that it must run to the river, and had best be
followed, subject to all gymnastic hazards. Mr. P. opposes,
but gives in. Watercourse followed accordingly.
Leaps, splashes, and tumbles, for two hours. C. lost.
C. D. whoops. Cries for assistance from behind. C. D.
returns. C. with horribly sprained ankle, lying in
rivulet!"</p>

<p>All the danger was over when Dickens sent his description;
but great had been the trouble in binding
up the sufferer's ankle and getting him painfully on,
shoving, shouldering, carrying alternately, till terra
firma was reached. "We got down at last in the
wildest place, preposterously out of the course; and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_172" id="Page_3_172">[172]</a></span>
propping up C. against stones, sent Mr. P. to the other
side of Cumberland for dog-cart, so got back to his
inn, and changed. Shoe or stocking on the bad foot,
out of the question. Foot tumbled up in a flannel
waistcoat. C. D. carrying C. melo-dramatically (Wardour
to the life!)<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> everywhere; into and out of carriages;
up and down stairs; to bed; every step. And
so to Wigton, got doctor, and here we are!! A pretty
business, we flatter ourselves!"</p>

<p>Wigton, Dickens described as a place of little houses
all in half-mourning, yellow stone or white stone and
black, with the wonderful peculiarity that though it
had no population, no business, and no streets to speak
of, it had five linendrapers within range of their single
window, one linendraper's next door, and five more
linendrapers round the corner. "I ordered a night
light in my bed-room. A queer little old woman
brought me one of the common Child's night lights,
and, seeming to think that I looked at it with interest,
said, 'It's joost a vara keeyourious thing, sir, and joost
new coom oop. It'll burn awt hoors a' end, and no
gootther, nor no waste, nor ony sike a thing, if you
can creedit what I say, seein' the airticle.'" In these
primitive quarters there befell a difficulty about letters,
which Dickens solved in a fashion especially his own.
"The day after Carrick there was a mess about our
letters, through our not going to a place called Mayport.
So, while the landlord was planning how to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_173" id="Page_3_173">[173]</a></span>
them (they were only twelve miles off), I walked off,
to his great astonishment, and brought them over."
The night after leaving Wigton they were at the Ship-hotel
in Allonby.</p>

<p>Allonby his letters presented as a small untidy outlandish
place; rough stone houses in half mourning, a
few coarse yellow-stone lodging houses with black roofs
(bills in all the windows), five bathing-machines, five
girls in straw hats, five men in straw hats (wishing they
had not come); very much what Broadstairs would
have been if it had been born Irish, and had not inherited
a cliff. "But this is a capital little homely
inn, looking out upon the sea; with the coast of Scotland,
mountainous and romantic, over against the
windows; and though I can just stand upright in my
bedroom, we are really well lodged. It is a clean nice
place in a rough wild country, and we have a very
obliging and comfortable landlady." He had found
indeed, in the latter, an acquaintance of old date.
"The landlady at the little inn at Allonby, lived at
Greta-Bridge in Yorkshire when I went down there
before <i>Nickleby;</i> and was smuggled into the room to
see me, after I was secretly found out. She is an immensely
fat woman now. 'But I could tuck my arm
round her waist then, Mr. Dickens,' the landlord said
when she told me the story as I was going to bed the
night before last. 'And can't you do it now?' I said.
'You insensible dog! Look at me! Here's a picture!'
Accordingly I got round as much of her as I could;
and this gallant action was the most successful I have
ever performed, on the whole."</p>

<p>On their way home the friends were at Doncaster,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_174" id="Page_3_174">[174]</a></span>
and this was Dickens's first experience of the St. Leger
and its saturnalia. His companion had by this time so
far recovered as to be able, doubled-up, to walk with a
thick stick; in which condition, "being exactly like
the gouty admiral in a comedy I have given him that
name." The impressions received from the race-week
were not favourable. It was noise and turmoil all day
long, and a gathering of vagabonds from all parts of
the racing earth. Every bad face that had ever caught
wickedness from an innocent horse had its representative
in the streets; and as Dickens, like Gulliver looking
down upon his fellow-men after coming from the
horse-country, looked down into Doncaster High-street
from his inn-window, he seemed to see everywhere
a then notorious personage who had just poisoned
his betting-companion. "Everywhere I see the late
Mr. Palmer with his betting-book in his hand. Mr.
Palmer sits next me at the theatre; Mr. Palmer goes
before me down the street; Mr. Palmer follows me into
the chemist's shop where I go to buy rose water after
breakfast, and says to the chemist 'Give us soom sal
volatile or soom damned thing o' that soort, in wather&mdash;my
head's bad!' And I look at the back of his bad
head repeated in long, long lines on the race course,
and in the betting stand and outside the betting rooms
in the town, and I vow to God that I can see nothing
in it but cruelty, covetousness, calculation, insensibility,
and low wickedness."</p>

<p>Even a half-appalling kind of luck was not absent
from my friend's experiences at the race course, when,
what he called a "wonderful, paralysing, coincidence"
befell him. He bought the card; facetiously wrote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_175" id="Page_3_175">[175]</a></span>
down three names for the winners of the three chief
races (never in his life having heard or thought of any
of the horses, except that the winner of the Derby,
who proved to be nowhere, had been mentioned to
him); "and, if you can believe it without your hair
standing on end, those three races were won, one after
another, by those three horses!!!" That was the St.
Leger-day, of which he also thought it noticeable,
that, though the losses were enormous, nobody had
won, for there was nothing but grinding of teeth and
blaspheming of ill-luck. Nor had matters mended on
the Cup-day, after which celebration "a groaning
phantom" lay in the doorway of his bed-room and
howled all night. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Th'">The</ins> landlord came up in the morning
to apologise, "and said it was a gentleman who had
lost &pound;1500 or &pound;2000; and he had drunk a deal afterwards;
and then they put him to bed, and then he&mdash;took
the 'orrors, and got up, and yelled till morning."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_176" id="Page_3_176">[176]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
Dickens might well believe, as he declared at the end
of his letter, that if a boy with any good in him, but
with a dawning propensity to sporting and betting,
were but brought to the Doncaster races soon enough,
it would cure him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> unsettled feeling greatly in excess of what was
usual with Dickens, more or less observable since his
first residence at Boulogne, became at this time almost
habitual, and the satisfactions which home should have
supplied, and which indeed were essential requirements
of his nature, he had failed to find in his home. He
had not the alternative that under this disappointment
some can discover in what is called society. It did
not suit him, and he set no store by it. No man was
better fitted to adorn any circle he entered, but beyond
that of friends and equals he rarely passed. He would
take as much pains to keep out of the houses of the
great as others take to get into them. Not always
wisely, it may be admitted. Mere contempt for toadyism
and flunkeyism was not at all times the prevailing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_178" id="Page_3_178">[178]</a></span>
motive with him which he supposed it to be. Beneath
his horror of those vices of Englishmen in his own
rank of life, there was a still stronger resentment at the
social inequalities that engender them, of which he was
not so conscious and to which he owned less freely.
Not the less it served secretly to justify what he might
otherwise have had no mind to. To say he was not a
gentleman would be as true as to say he was not a
writer; but if any one should assert his occasional
preference for what was even beneath his level over
that which was above it, this would be difficult of
disproof. It was among those defects of temperament
for which his early trials and his early successes were
accountable in perhaps equal measure. He was sensitive
in a passionate degree to praise and blame, which
yet he made it for the most part a point of pride to
assume indifference to; the inequalities of rank which
he secretly resented took more galling as well as glaring
prominence from the contrast of the necessities he had
gone through with the fame that had come to him;
and when the forces he most affected to despise assumed
the form of barriers he could not easily overleap, he was
led to appear frequently intolerant (for he very seldom
was really so) in opinions and language. His early
sufferings brought with them the healing powers of
energy, will, and persistence, and taught him the inexpressible
value of a determined resolve to live down
difficulties; but the habit, in small as in great things,
of renunciation and self-sacrifice, they did not teach;
and, by his sudden leap into a world-wide popularity
and influence, he became master of everything that
might seem to be attainable in life, before he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_179" id="Page_3_179">[179]</a></span>
mastered what a man must undergo to be equal to its
hardest trials.</p>

<p>Nothing of all this has yet presented itself to notice,
except in occasional forms of restlessness and desire
of change of place, which were themselves, when his
books were in progress, so incident as well to the active
requirements of his fancy as to call, thus far, for no
other explanation. Up to the date of the completion
of <i>Copperfield</i> he had felt himself to be in possession
of an all-sufficient resource. Against whatever might
befall he had a set-off in his imaginative creations, a
compensation derived from his art that never failed
him, because there he was supreme. It was the world
he could bend to his will, and make subserve to all his
desires. He had otherwise, underneath his exterior
of a singular precision, method, and strictly orderly
arrangement in all things, and notwithstanding a temperament
to which home and home interests were
really a necessity, something in common with those
eager, impetuous, somewhat overbearing natures, that
rush at existence without heeding the cost of it, and
are not more ready to accept and make the most of its
enjoyments than to be easily and quickly overthrown
by its burdens.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> But the world he had called into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_180" id="Page_3_180">[180]</a></span>
being had thus far borne him safely through these
perils. He had his own creations always by his side.
They were living, speaking companions. With them
only he was everywhere thoroughly identified. He
laughed and wept with them; was as much elated by
their fun as cast down by their grief; and brought to
the consideration of them a belief in their reality as
well as in the influences they were meant to exercise,
which in every circumstance sustained him.</p>

<p>It was during the composition of <i>Little Dorrit</i> that I
think he first felt a certain strain upon his invention
which brought with it other misgivings. In a modified
form this was present during the latter portions of
<i>Bleak House</i>, of which not a few of the defects might
be traced to the acting excitements amid which it was
written; but the succeeding book made it plainer to
him; and it is remarkable that in the interval between
them he resorted for the first and only time in his life
to a practice, which he abandoned at the close of his
next and last story published in the twenty-number
form, of putting down written "Memoranda" of suggestions
for characters or incidents by way of resource
to him in his writing. Never before had his teeming
fancy seemed to want such help; the need being less
to contribute to its fullness than to check its overflowing;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_181" id="Page_3_181">[181]</a></span>
but it is another proof that he had been secretly
bringing before himself, at least, the possibility that
what had ever been his great support might some day
desert him. It was strange that he should have had
such doubt, and he would hardly have confessed it
openly; but apart from that wonderful world of his
books, the range of his thoughts was not always proportioned
to the width and largeness of his nature.
His ordinary circle of activity, whether in likings or
thinkings, was full of such surprising animation, that
one was apt to believe it more comprehensive than it
really was; and again and again, when a wide horizon
might seem to be ahead of him, he would pull up suddenly
and stop short, as though nothing lay beyond.
For the time, though each had its term and change, he
was very much a man of one idea, each having its turn
of absolute predominance; and this was one of the
secrets of the thoroughness with which everything he
took in hand was done. As to the matter of his
writings, the actual truth was that his creative genius
never really failed him. Not a few of his inventions
of character and humour, up to the very close of his
life, his Marigolds, Lirripers, Gargerys, Pips, Sapseas
and many others, were as fresh and fine as in his greatest
day. He had however lost the free and fertile method
of the earlier time. He could no longer fill a wide-spread
canvas with the same facility and certainty as
of old; and he had frequently a quite unfounded
apprehension of some possible break-down, of which
the end might be at any moment beginning. There
came accordingly, from time to time, intervals of unusual
impatience and restlessness, strange to me in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_182" id="Page_3_182">[182]</a></span>
connection with his home; his old pursuits were too
often laid aside for other excitements and occupations;
he joined a public political agitation, set on foot
by administrative reformers; he got up various quasi-public
private theatricals, in which he took the leading
place; and though it was but part of his always generous
devotion in any friendly duty to organize the series
of performances on his friend Jerrold's death, yet the
eagerness with which he flung himself into them, so
arranging them as to assume an amount of labour in
acting and travelling that might have appalled an
experienced comedian, and carrying them on week
after week unceasingly in London and the provinces,
expressed but the craving which still had possession of
him to get by some means at some change that should
make existence easier. What was highest in his nature
had ceased for the time to be highest in his life, and he
had put himself at the mercy of lower accidents and
conditions. The mere effect of the strolling wandering
ways into which this acting led him could not be other
than unfavourable. But remonstrance as yet was unavailing.</p>

<p>To one very earnestly made in the early autumn of
1857, in which opportunity was taken to compare his
recent rush up Carrick Fell to his rush into other difficulties,
here was the reply. "Too late to say, put the
curb on, and don't rush at hills&mdash;the wrong man to say
it to. I have now no relief but in action. I am become
incapable of rest. I am quite confident I should
rust, break, and die, if I spared myself. Much better
to die, doing. What I am in that way, nature made
me first, and my way of life has of late, alas! confirmed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_183" id="Page_3_183">[183]</a></span>
I must accept the drawback&mdash;since it is one&mdash;with
the powers I have; and I must hold upon the
tenure prescribed to me." Something of the same
sad feeling, it is right to say, had been expressed from
time to time, in connection also with home dissatisfactions
and misgivings, through the three years preceding;
but I attributed it to other causes, and gave
little attention to it. During his absences abroad for
the greater part of 1854, '55, and '56, while the elder
of his children were growing out of childhood, and
his books were less easy to him than in his earlier manhood,
evidences presented themselves in his letters of
the old "unhappy loss or want of something" to which
he had given a pervading prominence in <i>Copperfield</i>.
In the first of those years he made express allusion to
the kind of experience which had been one of his descriptions
in that favourite book, and, mentioning the
drawbacks of his present life, had first identified it
with his own: "the so happy and yet so unhappy
existence which seeks its realities in unrealities, and
finds its dangerous comfort in a perpetual escape from
the disappointment of heart around it."</p>

<p>Later in the same year he thus wrote from Boulogne:
"I have had dreadful thoughts of getting away somewhere
altogether by myself. If I could have managed
it, I think possibly I might have gone to the Pyreennees
(you know what I mean that word for, so I won't
re-write it) for six months! I have put the idea into
the perspective of six months, but have not abandoned
it. I have visions of living for half a year or so, in all
sorts of inaccessible places, and opening a new book
therein. A floating idea of going up above the snow-line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_184" id="Page_3_184">[184]</a></span>
in Switzerland, and living in some astonishing
convent, hovers about me. If <i>Household Words</i> could
be got into a good train, in short, I don't know in
what strange place, or at what remote elevation above
the level of the sea, I might fall to work next. <i>Restlessness</i>,
you will say. Whatever it is, it is always
driving me, and I cannot help it. I have rested nine
or ten weeks, and sometimes feel as if it had been a
year&mdash;though I had the strangest nervous miseries before
I stopped. If I couldn't walk fast and far, I
should just explode and perish." Again, four months
later he wrote: "You will hear of me in Paris, probably
next Sunday, and I <i>may</i> go on to Bordeaux.
Have general ideas of emigrating in the summer to
the mountain-ground between France and Spain. Am
altogether in a dishevelled state of mind&mdash;motes of
new books in the dirty air, miseries of older growth
threatening to close upon me. Why is it, that as with
poor David, a sense comes always crushing on me now,
when I fall into low spirits, as of one happiness I have
missed in life, and one friend and companion I have
never made?"</p>

<p>Early in 1856 (20th of January) the notion revisited
him of writing a book in solitude. "Again I am beset
by my former notions of a book whereof the whole
story shall be on the top of the Great St. Bernard.
As I accept and reject ideas for <i>Little Dorrit</i>, it perpetually
comes back to me. Two or three years hence,
perhaps you'll find me living with the Monks and the
Dogs a whole winter&mdash;among the blinding snows that
fall about that monastery. I have a serious idea that
I shall do it, if I live." He was at this date in Paris;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_185" id="Page_3_185">[185]</a></span>
and during the visit to him of Macready in the following
April, the self-revelations were resumed. The
great actor was then living in retirement at Sherborne,
to which he had gone on quitting the stage; and Dickens
gave favourable report of his enjoyment of the
change to his little holiday at Paris. Then, after recurring
to his own old notion of having some slight
idea of going to settle in Australia, only he could not
do it until he should have finished <i>Little Dorrit</i>, he
went on to say that perhaps Macready, if he could get
into harness again, would not be the worse for some
such troubles as were worrying himself. "It fills me
with pity to think of him away in that lonely Sherborne
place. I have always felt of myself that I must,
please God, die in harness, but I have never felt it
more strongly than in looking at, and thinking of,
him. However strange it is to be never at rest, and
never satisfied, and ever trying after something that is
never reached, and to be always laden with plot and
plan and care and worry, how clear it is that it must
be, and that one is driven by an irresistible might until
the journey is worked out! It is much better to go on
and fret, than to stop and fret. As to repose&mdash;for
some men there's no such thing in this life. The foregoing
has the appearance of a small sermon; but it is
so often in my head in these days that it cannot help
coming out. The old days&mdash;the old days! Shall I
ever, I wonder, get the frame of mind back as it used
to be then? Something of it perhaps&mdash;but never quite
as it used to be. I find that the skeleton in my domestic
closet is becoming a pretty big one."</p>

<p>It would be unjust and uncandid not to admit that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_186" id="Page_3_186">[186]</a></span>
these and other similar passages in the letters that extended
over the years while he lived abroad, had served
in some degree as a preparation for what came after his
return to England in the following year. It came with
a great shock nevertheless; because it told plainly what
before had never been avowed, but only hinted at more
or less obscurely. The opening reference is to the reply
which had been made to a previous expression of
his wish for some confidences as in the old time. I give
only what is strictly necessary to account for what followed,
and even this with deep reluctance. "Your
letter of yesterday was so kind and hearty, and sounded
so gently the many chords we have touched together,
that I cannot leave it unanswered, though I have not
much (to any purpose) to say. My reference to 'confidences'
was merely to the relief of saying a word of
what has long been pent up in my mind. Poor Catherine
and I are not made for each other, and there is no
help for it. It is not only that she makes me uneasy
and unhappy, but that I make her so too&mdash;and much
more so. She is exactly what you know, in the way
of being amiable and complying; but we are strangely
ill-assorted for the bond there is between us. God
knows she would have been a thousand times happier
if she had married another kind of man, and that her
avoidance of this destiny would have been at least
equally good for us both. I am often cut to the heart
by thinking what a pity it is, for her own sake, that
I ever fell in her way; and if I were sick or disabled
to-morrow, I know how sorry she would be, and how
deeply grieved myself, to think how we had lost each
other. But exactly the same incompatibility would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_187" id="Page_3_187">[187]</a></span>
arise, the moment I was well again; and nothing on
earth could make her understand me, or suit us to each
other. Her temperament will not go with mine. It
mattered not so much when we had only ourselves to
consider, but reasons have been growing since which
make it all but hopeless that we should even try to
struggle on. What is now befalling me I have seen
steadily coming, ever since the days you remember
when Mary was born; and I know too well that you
cannot, and no one can, help me. Why I have even
written I hardly know; but it is a miserable sort of
comfort that you should be clearly aware how matters
stand. The mere mention of the fact, without any
complaint or blame of any sort, is a relief to my present
state of spirits&mdash;and I can get this only from you,
because I can speak of it to no one else." In the same
tone was his rejoinder to my reply. "To the most
part of what you say&mdash;Amen! You are not so tolerant
as perhaps you might be of the wayward and unsettled
feeling which is part (I suppose) of the tenure on which
one holds an imaginative life, and which I have, as you
ought to know well, often only kept down by riding
over it like a dragoon&mdash;but let that go by. I make no
maudlin complaint. I agree with you as to the very
possible incidents, even not less bearable than mine,
that might and must often occur to the married condition
when it is entered into very young. I am always
deeply sensible of the wonderful exercise I have of life
and its highest sensations, and have said to myself for
years, and have honestly and truly felt, This is the
drawback to such a career, and is not to be complained
of. I say it and feel it now as strongly as ever I did;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_188" id="Page_3_188">[188]</a></span>
and, as I told you in my last, I do not with that view
put all this forward. But the years have not made it
easier to bear for either of us; and, for her sake as well
as mine, the wish will force itself upon me that something
might be done. I know too well it is impossible.
There is the fact, and that is all one can say. Nor are
you to suppose that I disguise from myself what might
be urged on the other side. I claim no immunity from
blame. There is plenty of fault on my side, I dare say,
in the way of a thousand uncertainties, caprices, and
difficulties of disposition; but only one thing will alter
all that, and that is, the end which alters everything."</p>

<p>It will not seem to most people that there was anything
here which in happier circumstances might not
have been susceptible of considerate adjustment; but
all the circumstances were unfavourable, and the moderate
middle course which the admissions in that letter
might wisely have prompted and wholly justified, was
unfortunately not taken. Compare what before was
said of his temperament, with what is there said by
himself of its defects, and the explanation will not be
difficult. Every counteracting influence against the
one idea which now predominated over him had been
so weakened as to be almost powerless. His elder
children were no longer children; his books had lost
for the time the importance they formerly had over
every other consideration in his life; and he had not
in himself the resource that such a man, judging him
from the surface, might be expected to have had. Not
his genius only, but his whole nature, was too exclusively
made up of sympathy for, and with, the real in
its most intense form, to be sufficiently provided against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_189" id="Page_3_189">[189]</a></span>
failure in the realities around him. There was for him
no "city of the mind" against outward ills, for inner
consolation and shelter. It was in and from the actual
he still stretched forward to find the freedom and satisfactions
of an ideal, and by his very attempts to escape
the world he was driven back into the thick of it. But
what he would have sought there, it supplies to none;
and to get the infinite out of anything so finite, has
broken many a stout heart.</p>

<p>At the close of that last letter from Gadshill (5th
of September) was this question&mdash;"What do you think
of my paying for this place, by reviving that old idea
of some Readings from my books. I am very strongly
tempted. Think of it." The reasons against it had
great force, and took, in my judgment, greater from
the time at which it was again proposed. The old
ground of opposition remained. It was a substitution
of lower for higher aims; a change to commonplace
from more elevated pursuits; and it had so much of
the character of a public exhibition for money as to
raise, in the question of respect for his calling as a
writer, a question also of respect for himself as a gentleman.
This opinion, now strongly reiterated, was
referred ultimately to two distinguished ladies of his
acquaintance, who decided against it.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Yet not without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_190" id="Page_3_190">[190]</a></span>
such momentary misgiving in the direction of
"the stage," as pointed strongly to the danger, which,
by those who took the opposite view, was most of all
thought incident to the particular time of the proposal.
It might be a wild exaggeration to fear that he
was in danger of being led to adopt the stage as a calling,
but he was certainly about to place himself within
reach of not a few of its drawbacks and disadvantages.
To the full extent he perhaps did not himself know,
how much his eager present wish to become a public
reader was but the outcome of the restless domestic
discontents of the last four years; and that to indulge
it, and the unsettled habits inseparable from it, was to
abandon every hope of resettling his disordered home.
There is nothing, in its application to so divine a
genius as Shakespeare, more affecting than his expressed
dislike to a profession, which, in the jealous
self-watchfulness of his noble nature, he feared might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_191" id="Page_3_191">[191]</a></span>
hurt his mind.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The long subsequent line of actors
admirable in private as in public life, and all the
gentle and generous associations of the histrionic art,
have not weakened the testimony of its greatest name
against its less favourable influences; against the laxity
of habits it may encourage; and its public manners,
bred of public means, not always compatible with
home felicities and duties. But, freely open as Dickens
was to counsel in regard of his books, he was, for
reasons formerly stated,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> less accessible to it on points
of personal conduct; and when he had neither self-distrust
nor self-denial to hold him back, he would
push persistently forward to whatever object he had in
view.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_192" id="Page_3_192">[192]</a></span></p><p>An occurrence of the time hastened the decision in
this case. An enterprise had been set on foot for
establishment of a hospital for sick children;<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> a large
old-fashioned mansion in Great Ormond-street, with
spacious garden, had been fitted up with more than
thirty beds; during the four or five years of its existence,
outdoor and indoor relief had been afforded by
it to nearly fifty thousand children, of whom thirty
thousand were under five years of age; but, want of
funds having threatened to arrest the merciful work, it
was resolved to try a public dinner by way of charitable
appeal, and for president the happy choice was made
of one who had enchanted everybody with the joys and
sorrows of little children. Dickens threw himself into
the service heart and soul. There was a simple pathos
in his address from the chair quite startling in its effect
at such a meeting; and he probably never moved any
audience so much as by the strong personal feeling with
which he referred to the sacrifices made for the Hospital
by the very poor themselves: from whom a subscription
of fifty pounds, contributed in single pennies, had
come to the treasurer during almost every year it had
been open. The whole speech, indeed, is the best of
the kind spoken by him; and two little pictures from
it, one of the misery he had witnessed, the other of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_193" id="Page_3_193">[193]</a></span>
remedy he had found, should not be absent from the
picture of his own life.</p>

<p>"Some years ago, being in Scotland, I went with one
of the most humane members of the most humane of
professions, on a morning tour among some of the worst
lodged inhabitants of the old town of Edinburgh. In
the closes and wynds of that picturesque place (I am
sorry to remind you what fast friends picturesqueness
and typhus often are), we saw more poverty and sickness
in an hour than many people would believe in, in
a life. Our way lay from one to another of the most
wretched dwellings, reeking with horrible odours; shut
out from the sky and from the air, mere pits and dens.
In a room in one of these places, where there was an
empty porridge-pot on the cold hearth, a ragged woman
and some ragged children crouching on the bare ground
near it,&mdash;and, I remember as I speak, where the very
light, refracted from a high damp-stained wall outside,
came in trembling, as if the fever which had shaken
everything else had shaken even it,&mdash;there lay, in an
old egg-box which the mother had begged from a shop,
a little, feeble, wan, sick child. With his little wasted
face, and his little hot worn hands folded over his
breast, and his little bright attentive eyes, I can see
him now, as I have seen him for several years, looking
steadily at us. There he lay in his small frail box,
which was not at all a bad emblem of the small body
from which he was slowly parting&mdash;there he lay, quite
quiet, quite patient, saying never a word. He seldom
cried, the mother said; he seldom complained; 'he
lay there, seemin' to woonder what it was a' aboot.'
God knows, I thought, as I stood looking at him, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_194" id="Page_3_194">[194]</a></span>
had his reasons for wondering.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Many a poor child,
sick and neglected, I have seen since that time in London;
many have I also seen most affectionately tended,
in unwholesome houses and hard circumstances where
recovery was impossible: but at all such times I have
seen my little drooping friend in his egg-box, and he
has always addressed his dumb wonder to me what it
meant, and why, in the name of a gracious God, such
things should be!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But, ladies and gentlemen,"
Dickens added, "such things need <span class="smcap">not</span> be, and will
not be, if this company, which is a drop of the life-blood
of the great compassionate public heart, will
only accept the means of rescue and prevention which
it is mine to offer. Within a quarter of a mile of this
place where I speak, stands a once courtly old house,
where blooming children were born, and grew up to be
men and women, and married, and brought their own
blooming children back to patter up the old oak staircase
which stood but the other day, and to wonder at
the old oak carvings on the chimney-pieces. In the
airy wards into which the old state drawing-rooms and
family bedchambers of that house are now converted,
are lodged such small patients that the attendant nurses
look like reclaimed giantesses, and the kind medical
practitioner like an amiable Christian ogre. Grouped
about the little low tables in the centre of the rooms,
are such tiny convalescents that they seem to be playing
at having been ill. On the doll's beds are such diminutive
creatures that each poor sufferer is supplied with its
tray of toys: and, looking round, you may see how the
little tired flushed cheek has toppled over half the brute
creation on its way into the ark; or how one little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_195" id="Page_3_195">[195]</a></span>
dimpled arm has mowed down (as I saw myself) the
whole tin soldiery of Europe. On the walls of these
rooms are graceful, pleasant, bright, childish pictures.
At the beds' heads, hang representations of the figure
which is the universal embodiment of all mercy and
compassion, the figure of Him who was once a child
Himself, and a poor one. But alas! reckoning up the
number of beds that are there, the visitor to this Child's
Hospital will find himself perforce obliged to stop at
very little over thirty; and will learn, with sorrow and
surprise, that even that small number, so forlornly, so
miserably diminutive compared with this vast London,
cannot possibly be maintained unless the Hospital be
made better known. I limit myself to saying better
known, because I will not believe that in a Christian
community of fathers and mothers, and brothers and
sisters, it can fail, being better known, to be well and
richly-endowed." It was a brave and true prediction.
The Child's Hospital has never since known want.
That night alone added greatly more than three thousand
pounds to its funds, and Dickens put the crown to
his good work by reading on its behalf, shortly afterwards,
his <i>Christmas Carol;</i> when the sum realized,
and the urgent demand that followed for a repetition
of the pleasure given by the reading, bore down farther
opposition to the project of his engaging publicly in
such readings for himself.</p>

<p>The Child's Hospital night was the 9th of February,
its Reading was appointed for the 15th of April, and,
nearly a month before, renewed efforts at remonstrance
had been made. "Your view of the reading matter,"
Dickens replied, "I still think is unconsciously taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_196" id="Page_3_196">[196]</a></span>
from your own particular point. You don't seem to
me to get out of yourself in considering it. A word
more upon it. You are not to think I have made up
my mind. If I had, why should I not say so? I find
very great difficulty in doing so because of what you
urge, because I know the question to be a balance of
doubts, and because I most honestly feel in my innermost
heart, in this matter (as in all others for years and
years), the honour of the calling by which I have
always stood most conscientiously. But do you quite
consider that the public exhibition of oneself takes
place equally, whosoever may get the money? And
have you any idea that at this moment&mdash;this very time&mdash;half
the public at least supposes me to be paid?
My dear F, out of the twenty or five-and-twenty letters
a week that I get about Readings, twenty will ask at
what price, or on what terms, it can be done. The
only exceptions, in truth, are when the correspondent
is a clergyman, or a banker, or the member for the
place in question. Why, at this very time half Scotland
believes that I am paid for going to Edinburgh!&mdash;Here
is Greenock writes to me, and asks could it
be done for a hundred pounds? There is Aberdeen
writes, and states the capacity of its hall, and says,
though far less profitable than the very large hall in
Edinburgh, is it not enough to come on for? W. answers
such letters continually. (&mdash;At this place, enter
Beale. He called here yesterday morning, and then
wrote to ask if I would see him to-day. I replied
'Yes,' so here he came in. With long preface called
to know whether it was possible to arrange anything
in the way of Readings for this autumn&mdash;say, six<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_197" id="Page_3_197">[197]</a></span>
months. Large capital at command. Could produce
partners, in such an enterprise, also with large capital.
Represented such. Returns would be enormous.
Would I name a sum? a minimum sum that I required
to have, in any case? Would I look at it as a Fortune,
and in no other point of view? I shook my head,
and said, my tongue was tied on the subject for the
present; I might be more communicative at another
time. Exit Beale in confusion and disappointment.)&mdash;You
will be happy to hear that at one on Friday,
the Lord Provost, Dean of Guild, Magistrates, and
Council of the ancient city of Edinburgh will wait
(in procession) on their brother freeman, at the Music
Hall, to give him hospitable welcome. Their brother
freeman has been cursing their stars and his own, ever
since the receipt of solemn notification to this effect."
But very grateful, when it came, was the enthusiasm
of the greeting, and welcome the gift of the silver
wassail-bowl which followed the reading of the <i>Carol</i>.
"I had no opportunity of asking any one's advice in
Edinburgh," he wrote on his return. "The crowd
was too enormous, and the excitement in it much too
great. But my determination is all but taken. I must
do <i>something</i>, or I shall wear my heart away. I can see
no better thing to do that is half so hopeful in itself,
or half so well suited to my restless state."</p>

<p>What is pointed at in those last words had been
taken as a ground of objection, and thus he turned it
into an argument the other way. During all these
months many sorrowful misunderstandings had continued
in his home, and the relief sought from the
misery had but the effect of making desperate any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_198" id="Page_3_198">[198]</a></span>
hope of a better understanding. "It becomes necessary,"
he wrote at the end of March, "with a view to
the arrangements that would have to be begun next
month if I decided on the Readings, to consider and
settle the question of the Plunge. Quite dismiss from
your mind any reference whatever to present circumstances
at home. Nothing can put <i>them</i> right, until
we are all dead and buried and risen. It is not, with
me, a matter of will, or trial, or sufferance, or good
humour, or making the best of it, or making the worst
of it, any longer. It is all despairingly over. Have
no lingering hope of, or for, me in this association.
A dismal failure has to be borne, and there an end.
Will you then try to think of this reading project (as I
do) apart from all personal likings and dislikings, and
solely with a view to its effect on that peculiar relation
(personally affectionate, and like no other man's)
which subsists between me and the public? I want
your most careful consideration. If you would like,
when you have gone over it in your mind, to discuss
the matter with me and Arthur Smith (who would
manage the whole of the business, which I should
never touch); we will make an appointment. But I
ought to add that Arthur Smith plainly says, 'Of the
immense return in money, I have no doubt. Of the
Dash into the new position, however, I am not so good
a judge.' I enclose you a rough note<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> of my project,
as it stands in my mind."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_199" id="Page_3_199">[199]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Arthur Smith, a man possessed of many qualities
that justified the confidence Dickens placed in
him, might not have been a good judge of the "Dash"
into the new position, but no man knew better every
disadvantage incident to it, or was less likely to be
disconcerted by any. His exact fitness to manage the
scheme successfully, made him an unsafe counsellor
respecting it. Within a week from this time the reading
for the Charity was to be given. "They have
let," Dickens wrote on the 9th of April, "five hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_200" id="Page_3_200">[200]</a></span>
stalls for the Hospital night; and as people come
every day for more, and it is out of the question to
make more, they cannot be restrained at St. Martin's
Hall from taking down names for other readings."
This closed the attempt at further objection. Exactly
a fortnight after the reading for the children's hospital,
on Thursday the 29th April, came the first public reading
for his own benefit; and before the next month was
over, this launch into a new life had been followed by
a change in his old home. Thenceforward he and his
wife lived apart. The eldest son went with his mother,
Dickens at once giving effect to her expressed wish in
this respect; and the other children remained with
himself, their intercourse with Mrs. Dickens being left
entirely to themselves. It was thus far an arrangement
of a strictly private nature, and no decent person
could have had excuse for regarding it in any other
light, if public attention had not been unexpectedly
invited to it by a printed statement in <i>Household
Words</i>. Dickens was stung into this by some miserable
gossip at which in ordinary circumstances no man
would more determinedly have been silent; but he had
now publicly to show himself, at stated times, as a
public entertainer, and this, with his name even so
aspersed, he found to be impossible. All he would
concede to my strenuous resistance against such a publication,
was an offer to suppress it, if, upon reference
to the opinion of a certain distinguished man (still
living), that opinion should prove to be in agreement
with mine. Unhappily it fell in with his own,
and the publication went on. It was followed by another
statement, a letter subscribed with his name,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_201" id="Page_3_201">[201]</a></span>
which got into print without his sanction; nothing
publicly being known of it (I was not among those
who had read it privately) until it appeared in the
<i>New York Tribune</i>. It had been addressed and given
to Mr. Arthur Smith as an authority for correction of
false rumours and scandals, and Mr. Smith had given
a copy of it, with like intention, to the <i>Tribune</i> correspondent
in London. Its writer referred to it always
afterwards as his "violated letter."</p>

<p>The course taken by the author of this book at the
time of these occurrences, will not be departed from
here. Such illustration of grave defects in Dickens's
character as the passage in his life affords, I have not
shrunk from placing side by side with such excuses in
regard to it as he had unquestionable right to claim
should be put forward also. How far what remained
of his story took tone or colour from it, and especially
from the altered career on which at the same time he
entered, will thus be sufficiently explained; and with
anything else the public have nothing to do.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I was</span> better pleased with Gadshill Place last
Saturday," he wrote to me from Paris on the 13th of
February 1856, "on going down there, even than I
had prepared myself to be. The country, against
every disadvantage of season, is beautiful; and the
house is so old fashioned, cheerful, and comfortable,
that it is really pleasant to look at. The good old
Rector now there, has lived in it six and twenty years,
so I have not the heart to turn him out. He is to
remain till Lady-Day next year, when I shall go in,
please God; make my alterations; furnish the house;
and keep it for myself that summer." Returning to
England through the Kentish country with Mr. Wilkie
Collins in July, other advantages occurred to him. "A
railroad opened from Rochester to Maidstone, which
connects Gadshill at once with the whole sea coast, is
certainly an addition to the place, and an enhancement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_203" id="Page_3_203">[203]</a></span>
of its value. Bye and bye we shall have the

half of Dover. I am glad to hear of your having been
in the neighbourhood. There is no healthier (marshes
avoided), and none in my eyes more beautiful. One
of these days I shall show you some places up the
Medway with which you will be charmed."</p>

</div>

<p>The association with his youthful fancy that first
made the place attractive to him has been told; and
it was with wonder he had heard one day, from his
friend and fellow worker at <i>Household Words</i>, Mr. W.
H. Wills, that not only was the house for sale to which
he had so often looked wistfully, but that the lady
chiefly interested as its owner had been long known
and much esteemed by himself. Such curious chances
led Dickens to his saying about the smallness of the
world; but the close relation often found thus existing
between things and persons far apart, suggests not so
much the smallness of the world as the possible importance
of the least things done in it, and is better
explained by the grander teaching of Carlyle, that
causes and effects, connecting every man and thing
with every other, extend through all space and time.</p>

<p>It was at the close of 1855 the negociation for its
purchase began. "They wouldn't," he wrote (25th of
November), "take &pound;1700 for the Gadshill property, but
'finally' wanted &pound;1800. I have finally offered &pound;1750.
It will require an expenditure of about &pound;300 more
before yielding &pound;100 a year." The usual discovery
of course awaited him that this first estimate would
have to be increased threefold. "The changes absolutely
necessary" (9th of February 1856) "will take
a thousand pounds; which sum I am always resolving
to squeeze out of this, grind out of that, and wring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_205" id="Page_3_205">[205]</a></span>
out of the other; this, that, and the other generally
all three declining to come up to the scratch for the
purpose." "This day,"<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> he wrote on the 14th of
March, "I have paid the purchase money for Gadshill
Place. After drawing the cheque (&pound;1790) I turned
round to give it to Wills, and said, 'Now isn't it an
extraordinary thing&mdash;look at the Day&mdash;Friday! I have
been nearly drawing it half a dozen times when the
lawyers have not been ready, and here it comes round
upon a Friday as a matter of course.'" He had no
thought at this time of reserving the place wholly for
himself, or of making it his own residence except at
intervals of summer. He looked upon it as an investment
only. "You will hardly know Gadshill again,"
he wrote in January 1858, "I am improving it so much&mdash;yet
I have no interest in the place." But continued
ownership brought increased liking; he took more and
more interest in his own improvements, which were
just the kind of occasional occupation and resource
his life most wanted in its next seven or eight years;
and any farther idea of letting it he soon abandoned
altogether. It only once passed out of his possession
thus, for four months in 1859; in the following year,
on the sale of Tavistock House, he transferred to it his
books and pictures and choicer furniture; and thenceforward,
varied only by houses taken from time to time
for the London season, he made it his permanent
family abode. Now and then, even during those years,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_206" id="Page_3_206">[206]</a></span>
he would talk of selling it; and on his last return from
America, when he had sent the last of his sons out into
the world, he really might have sold it if he could
then have found a house in London suitable to him,
and such as he could purchase. But in this he failed;
secretly to his own satisfaction, as I believe; and thereupon,
in that last autumn of his life, he projected and
carried out his most costly addition to Gadshill.
Already of course more money had been spent upon it
than his first intention in buying it would have justified.
He had so enlarged the accommodation, improved the
grounds and offices, and added to the land, that, taking
also into account this final outlay, the reserved price
placed upon the whole after his death more than quadrupled
what he had given in 1856 for the house, shrubbery,
and twenty years' lease of a meadow field. It
was then purchased, and is now inhabited, by his
eldest son.</p>

<p>Its position has been described, and one of the last-century-histories
of Rochester quaintly mentions the
principal interest of the locality. "Near the twenty-seventh
stone from London is Gadshill, supposed to
have been the scene of the robbery mentioned by
Shakespeare in his play of Henry IV; there being reason
to think also that it was Sir John Falstaff, of truly
comic memory, who under the name of Oldcastle inhabited
Cooling Castle of which the ruins are in the
neighbourhood. A small distance to the left appears
on an eminence the Hermitage the seat of the late Sir
Francis Head, Bart;<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and close to the road, on a small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_207" id="Page_3_207">[207]</a></span>
ascent, is a neat building lately erected by Mr. Day.
In descending Strood-hill is a fine prospect of Strood,
Rochester, and Chatham, which three towns form a
continued street extending above two miles in length."
It had been supposed<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> that "the neat building lately
erected by Mr. Day" was that which the great novelist
made famous; but Gadshill Place had no existence until
eight years after the date of the history. The good
rector who so long lived in it told me, in 1859, that it
had been built eighty years before by a then well-known
character in those parts, one Stevens, father-in-law of
Henslow the Cambridge professor of botany. Stevens,
who could only with much difficulty manage to write
his name, had begun life as ostler at an inn; had become
husband to the landlord's widow; then a brewer;
and finally, as he subscribed himself on one occasion,
"mare" of Rochester. Afterwards the house was inhabited
by Mr. Lynn (from some of the members of
whose family Dickens made his purchase); and, before
the Rev. Mr. Hindle became its tenant, it was inhabited
by a Macaroni parson named Townshend, whose
horses the Prince Regent bought, throwing into the
bargain a box of much desired cigars. Altogether the
place had notable associations even apart from those
which have connected it with the masterpieces of English
humour. "<span class="smcap">This House, Gadshill Place</span>, stands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_208" id="Page_3_208">[208]</a></span>
on the summit of Shakespeare's Gadshill, ever memorable
for its association with Sir John Falstaff in his
noble fancy. <i>But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning,
by four o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims
going to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders riding
to London with fat purses: I have vizards for you
all; you have horses for yourselves.</i>" Illuminated by
Mr. Owen Jones, and placed in a frame on the first-floor
landing, these words were the greeting of the new
tenant to his visitors. It was his first act of ownership.</p>

<p>All his improvements, it should perhaps be remarked,
were not exclusively matters of choice; and to illustrate
by his letters what befell at the beginning of his changes,
will show what attended them to the close. His earliest
difficulty was very grave. There was only one spring
of water for gentlefolk and villagers, and from some of
the houses or cottages it was two miles away. "We are
still" (6th of July) "boring for water here, at the rate
of two pounds per day for wages. The men seem to
like it very much, and to be perfectly comfortable."
Another of his earliest experiences (5th of September)
was thus expressed: "Hop-picking is going on, and
people sleep in the garden, and breathe in at the keyhole
of the house door. I have been amazed, before
this year, by the number of miserable lean wretches,
hardly able to crawl, who go hop-picking. I find it is
a superstition that the dust of the newly picked hop,
falling freshly into the throat, is a cure for consumption.
So the poor creatures drag themselves along the roads,
and sleep under wet hedges, and get cured soon and
finally." Towards the close of the same month (24th
of September) he wrote: "Here are six men perpetually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_209" id="Page_3_209">[209]</a></span>
going up and down the well (I know that somebody
will be killed), in the course of fitting a pump; which
is quite a railway terminus&mdash;it is so iron, and so big.
The process is much more like putting Oxford-street
endwise, and laying gas along it, than anything else.
By the time it is finished, the cost of this water will be
something absolutely frightful. But of course it proportionately
increases the value of the property, and
that's my only comfort.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The horse has gone lame
from a sprain, the big dog has run a tenpenny nail into
one of his hind feet, the bolts have all flown out of the
basket-carriage, and the gardener says all the fruit trees
want replacing with new ones." Another note came
in three days. "I have discovered that the seven miles
between Maidstone and Rochester is one of the most
beautiful walks in England. Five men have been looking
attentively at the pump for a week, and (I should
hope) may begin to fit it in the course of October." .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>With even such varying fortune he effected other
changes.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> The exterior remained to the last much as
it was when he used as a boy to see it first; a plain,
old-fashioned, two-story, brick-built country house,
with a bell-turret on the roof, and over the front door
a quaint neat wooden porch with pillars and seats.
But, among his additions and alterations, was a new
drawing-room built out from the smaller existing one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_210" id="Page_3_210">[210]</a></span>
both being thrown together ultimately; two good bedrooms
built on a third floor at the back; and such rearrangement
of the ground floor as, besides its handsome
drawing-room, and its dining-room which he
hung with pictures, transformed its bedroom into a
study which he lined with books and sometimes wrote
in, and changed its breakfast-parlour into a retreat
fitted up for smokers into which he put a small billiard-table.
These several rooms opened from a hall
having in it a series of Hogarth prints, until, after the
artist's death, Stanfield's noble scenes were placed
there, when the Hogarths were moved to his bedroom;
and in this hall, during his last absence in America, a
parquet floor was laid down. Nor did he omit such
changes as might increase the comfort of his servants.
He built entirely new offices and stables, and replaced
a very old coach-house by a capital servants' hall,
transforming the loft above into a commodious school-room
or study for his boys. He made at the same
time an excellent croquet-ground out of a waste piece
of orchard.</p>

<p>Belonging to the house, but unfortunately placed on
the other side of the high road, was a shrubbery, well
wooded though in desolate condition, in which stood
two magnificent cedars; and having obtained, in 1859,
the consent of the local authorities for the necessary
underground work, Dickens constructed a passage beneath
the road<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> from his front lawn; and in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_211" id="Page_3_211">[211]</a></span>
shrubbery thus rendered accessible, and which he then
laid out very prettily, he placed afterwards a Swiss
ch&acirc;let<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> presented to him by Mr. Fechter, which arrived
from Paris in ninety-four pieces fitting like the
joints of a puzzle, but which proved to be somewhat
costly in setting on its legs by means of a foundation
of brickwork. Once up, however, it was a great resource
in the summer months, and much of Dickens's
work was done there. "I have put five mirrors in the
ch&acirc;let where I write,"<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> he told an American friend,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_212" id="Page_3_212">[212]</a></span>
"and they reflect and refract, in all kinds of ways, the
leaves that are quivering at the windows, and the great
fields of waving corn, and the sail-dotted river. My
room is up among the branches of the trees; and the
birds and the butterflies fly in and out, and the green
branches shoot in at the open windows, and the lights
and shadows of the clouds come and go with the rest
of the company. The scent of the flowers, and indeed
of everything that is growing for miles and miles, is
most delicious." He used to make great boast, too,
not only of his crowds of singing birds all day, but
of his nightingales at night.</p>

</div>

<p>One or two more extracts from letters having reference
to these changes may show something of the
interest to him with which Gadshill thus grew under
his hands. A sun-dial on his back-lawn had a bit of
historic interest about it. "One of the balustrades of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_213" id="Page_3_213">[213]</a></span>
the destroyed old Rochester Bridge," he wrote to his
daughter in June 1859, "has been (very nicely) presented
to me by the contractors for the works, and
has been duly stone-masoned and set up on the lawn
behind the house. I have ordered a sun-dial for the
top of it, and it will be a very good object indeed."
"When you come down here next month," he wrote
to me, "we have an idea that we shall show you rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_214" id="Page_3_214">[214]</a></span>
a neat house. What terrific adventures have been in
action; how many overladen vans were knocked up
at Gravesend, and had to be dragged out of Chalk-turnpike
in the dead of the night by the whole equine
power of this establishment; shall be revealed at
another time." That was in the autumn of 1860,
when, on the sale of his London house, its contents
were transferred to his country home. "I shall have
an alteration or two to show you at Gadshill that
greatly improve the little property; and when I get
the workmen out this time, I think I'll leave off."
October 1861 had now come, when the new bedrooms
were built; but in the same month of 1863 he announced
his transformation of the old coach-house.
"I shall have a small new improvement to show you
at Gads, which I think you will accept as the crowning
ingenuity of the inimitable." But of course it was not
over yet. "My small work and planting," he wrote
in the spring of 1866, "really, truly, and positively
the last, are nearly at an end in these regions, and the
result will await summer inspection." No, nor even
yet. He afterwards obtained, by exchange of some
land with the trustees of Watts's Charity, the much
coveted meadow at the back of the house of which
heretofore he had the lease only; and he was then
able to plant a number of young limes and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'chesnuts'">chestnuts</ins>
and other quick-growing trees. He had already planted
a row of limes in front. He had no idea, he would
say, of planting only for the benefit of posterity, but
would put into the ground what he might himself enjoy
the sight and shade of. He put them in two or three
clumps in the meadow, and in a belt all round.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_215" id="Page_3_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Still there were "more last words," for the limit
was only to be set by his last year of life. On
abandoning his notion, after the American Readings,
of exchanging Gadshill for London, a new staircase
was put up from the hall; a parquet floor laid on
the first landing; and a conservatory built, opening
into both drawing-room and dining-room, "glass and
iron," as he described it, "brilliant but expensive, with
foundations as of an ancient Roman work of horrible
solidity." This last addition had long been an object
of desire with him; though he would hardly even now
have given himself the indulgence but for the golden
shower from America. He saw it first in a completed
state on the Sunday before his death, when his younger
daughter was on a visit to him. "Well, Katey," he
said to her, "now you see <span class="smcap">positively</span> the last improvement
at Gadshill;" and every one laughed at the joke
against himself. The success of the new conservatory
was unquestionable. It was the remark of all around
him that he was certainly, from this last of his improvements,
drawing more enjoyment than from any
of its predecessors, when the scene for ever closed.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the course of his daily life in the country there
is not much to be said. Perhaps there was never a man
who changed places so much and habits so little. He
was always methodical and regular; and passed his life
from day to day, divided for the most part between
working and walking, the same wherever he was. The
only exception was when special or infrequent visitors
were with him. When such friends as Longfellow and
his daughters, or Charles Eliot Norton and his wife,
came, or when Mr. Fields brought his wife and Professor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_216" id="Page_3_216">[216]</a></span>
Lowell's daughter, or when he received other
Americans to whom he owed special courtesy, he would
compress into infinitely few days an enormous amount
of sight seeing and country enjoyment, castles, cathedrals,
and fortified lines, lunches and picnics among
cherry orchards and hop-gardens, excursions to Canterbury
or Maidstone and their beautiful neighbourhoods,
Druid-stone and Blue Bell Hill. "All the
neighbouring country that could be shown in so short
a time," he wrote of the Longfellow visit, "they saw.
I turned out a couple of postilions in the old red jackets
of the old red royal Dover road for our ride, and it
was like a holiday ride in England fifty years ago."
For Lord Lytton he did the same, for the Emerson
Tennents, for Mr. Layard and Mr. Helps, for Lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_217" id="Page_3_217">[217]</a></span>
Molesworth and the Higginses (Jacob Omnium), and
such other less frequent visitors.</p>

<p>Excepting on such particular occasions however, and
not always even then, his mornings were reserved
wholly to himself; and he would generally preface his
morning work (such was his love of order in everything
around him) by seeing that all was in its place in the
several rooms, visiting also the dogs, stables, and
kitchen garden, and closing, unless the weather was
very bad indeed, with a turn or two round the meadow
before settling to his desk. His dogs were a great
enjoyment to him;<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and, with his high road traversed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_218" id="Page_3_218">[218]</a></span>
as frequently as any in England by tramps and wayfarers
of a singularly undesirable description, they were
also a necessity. There were always two, of the mastiff
kind, but latterly the number increased. His own
favourite was Turk, a noble animal, full of affection
and intelligence, whose death by a railway-accident,
shortly after the Staplehurst catastrophe, caused him
great grief. Turk's sole companion up to that date
was Linda, puppy of a great St. Bernard brought over
by Mr. Albert Smith, and grown into a superbly beautiful
creature. After Turk there was an interval of an
Irish dog, Sultan, given by Mr. Percy Fitzgerald; a
cross between a St. Bernard and a bloodhound, built
and coloured like a lioness and of splendid proportions,
but of such indomitably aggressive propensities, that,
after breaking his kennel-chain and nearly devouring a
luckless little sister of one of the servants, he had to
be killed. Dickens always protested that Sultan was a
Fenian, for that no dog, not a secretly sworn member
of that body, would ever have made such a point,
muzzled as he was, of rushing at and bearing down
with fury anything in scarlet with the remotest resemblance
to a British uniform. Sultan's successor was
Don, presented by Mr. Frederic Lehmann, a grand
Newfoundland brought over very young, who with
Linda became parent to a couple of Newfoundlands,
that were still gambolling about their master, huge,
though hardly out of puppydom, when they lost him.
He had given to one of them the name of Bumble,
from having observed, as he described it, "a peculiarly
pompous and overbearing manner he had of appearing
to mount guard over the yard when he was an absolute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_219" id="Page_3_219">[219]</a></span>
infant." Bumble was often in scrapes. Describing
to Mr. Fields a drought in the summer of 1868, when
their poor supply of ponds and surface wells had become
waterless, he wrote: "I do not let the great
dogs swim in the canal, because the people have to
drink of it. But when they get into the Medway, it is
hard to get them out again. The other day Bumble
(the son, Newfoundland dog) got into difficulties among
some floating timber, and became frightened. Don
(the father) was standing by me, shaking off the wet
and looking on carelessly, when all of a sudden he
perceived something amiss, and went in with a bound
and brought Bumble out by the ear. The scientific
way in which he towed him along was charming."
The description of his own reception, on his reappearance
after America, by Bumble and his brother, by the
big and beautiful Linda, and by his daughter Mary's
handsome little Pomeranian, may be added from his
letters to the same correspondent. "The two Newfoundland
dogs coming to meet me, with the usual
carriage and the usual driver, and beholding me coming
in my usual dress out at the usual door, it struck
me that their recollection of my having been absent
for any unusual time was at once cancelled. They
behaved (they are both young dogs) exactly in their
usual manner; coming behind the basket phaeton as
we trotted along, and lifting their heads to have their
ears pulled, a special attention which they receive from
no one else. But when I drove into the stable-yard,
Linda (the St. Bernard) was greatly excited; weeping
profusely, and throwing herself on her back that she
might caress my foot with her great fore-paws. Mary's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_220" id="Page_3_220">[220]</a></span>
little dog too, Mrs. Bouncer, barked in the greatest
agitation on being called down and asked by Mary,
'Who is this?' and tore round and round me like the
dog in the Faust outlines." The father and mother
and their two sons, four formidable-looking companions,
were with him generally in his later walks.</p>

<p>Round Cobham, skirting the park and village and
passing the Leather Bottle famous in the page of <i>Pickwick</i>,
was a favourite walk with Dickens. By Rochester
and the Medway, to the Chatham Lines, was
another. He would turn out of Rochester High-street
through The Vines (where some old buildings, from
one of which called Restoration-house he took Satis-house
for <i>Great Expectations</i>, had a curious attraction
for him), would pass round by Fort Pitt, and coming
back by Frindsbury would bring himself by some cross
fields again into the high road. Or, taking the other
side, he would walk through the marshes to Gravesend,
return by Chalk church, and stop always to have greeting
with a comical old monk who for some incomprehensible
reason sits carved in stone, cross-legged with
a jovial pot, over the porch of that sacred edifice. To
another drearier churchyard, itself forming part of the
marshes beyond the Medway, he often took friends to
show them the dozen small tombstones of various sizes
adapted to the respective ages of a dozen small children
of one family which he made part of his story of
<i>Great Expectations</i>, though, with the reserves always
necessary in copying nature not to overstep her modesty
by copying too closely, he makes the number that
appalled little Pip not more than half the reality.
About the whole of this Cooling churchyard, indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_221" id="Page_3_221">[221]</a></span>
and the neighbouring castle ruins, there was a weird
strangeness that made it one of his attractive walks in
the late year or winter, when from Higham he could
get to it across country over the stubble fields; and,
for a shorter summer walk, he was not less fond of going
round the village of Shorne, and sitting on a hot afternoon
in its pretty shaded churchyard. But on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_222" id="Page_3_222">[222]</a></span>
whole, though Maidstone had also much that attracted
him to its neighbourhood, the Cobham neighbourhood
was certainly that which he had greatest pleasure in;
and he would have taken oftener than he did the walk
through Cobham park and woods, which was the last
he enjoyed before life suddenly closed upon him, but
that here he did not like his dogs to follow.</p>


<p>Don now has his home there with Lord Darnley, and
Linda lies under one of the cedars at Gadshill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickens</span> gave his paid public Readings successively,
with not long intervals, at four several dates; in
1858-9, in 1861-63, in 1866-67, and in 1868-70; the
first series under Mr. Arthur Smith's management,
the second under Mr. Headland's, and the third and
fourth, in America as well as before and after it, under
that of Mr. George Dolby, who, excepting in America,
acted for the Messrs. Chappell. The references in the
present chapter are to the first series only.</p>

<p>It began with sixteen nights at St. Martin's Hall, the
first on the 29th of April, the last on the 22nd of July,
1858; and there was afterwards a provincial tour of
87 readings, beginning at Clifton on the 2nd of August,
ending at Brighton on the 13th of November, and
taking in Ireland and Scotland as well as the principal
English cities: to which were added, in London, three
Christmas readings, three in January, with two in the
following month; and, in the provinces in the month<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_224" id="Page_3_224">[224]</a></span>
of October, fourteen, beginning at Ipswich and Norwich,
taking in Cambridge and Oxford, and closing
with Birmingham and Cheltenham. The series had
comprised altogether 125 Readings when it ended on
the 27th of October, 1859; and without the touches
of character and interest afforded by his letters written
while thus employed, the picture of the man would not
be complete.</p>

<p>Here was one day's work at the opening which will
show something of the fatigue they involved even at
their outset. "On Friday we came from Shrewsbury to
Chester; saw all right for the evening; and then went
to Liverpool. Came back from Liverpool and read at
Chester. Left Chester at 11 at night, after the reading,
and went to London. Got to Tavistock House at 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
on Saturday, left it at a quarter past 10 that morning,
and came down here" (Gadshill: 15th of August 1858).</p>

<p>The "greatest personal affection and respect" had
greeted him everywhere. Nothing could have been
"more strongly marked or warmly expressed;" and
the readings had "gone" quite wonderfully. What in
this respect had most impressed him, at the outset of
his adventures, was Exeter. "I think they were the
finest audience I ever read to; I don't think I ever
read in some respects so well; and I never beheld anything
like the personal affection which they poured out
upon me at the end. I shall always look back upon it
with pleasure." He often lost his voice in these early
days, having still to acquire the art of husbanding it;
and in the trial to recover it would again waste its
power. "I think I sang half the Irish melodies to myself
as I walked about, to test it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_225" id="Page_3_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>An audience of two thousand three hundred people
(the largest he had had) greeted him at Liverpool on
his way to Dublin, and, besides the tickets sold, more
than two hundred pounds in money was taken at the
doors. This taxed his business staff a little. "They
turned away hundreds, sold all the books, rolled on
the ground of my room knee-deep in checks, and made
a perfect pantomime of the whole thing." (20th of
August.) He had to repeat the reading thrice.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>It was the first time he had seen Ireland, and Dublin
greatly surprised him by appearing to be so much larger
and more populous than he had supposed. He found
it to have altogether an unexpectedly thriving look,
being pretty nigh as big, he first thought, as Paris; of
which some places in it, such as the quays on the river,
reminded him. Half the first day he was there, he
took to explore it; walking till tired, and then taking
a car. "Power, dressed for the character of Teddy the
Tiler, drove me: in a suit of patches, and with his hat
unbrushed for twenty years. Wonderfully pleasant,
light, intelligent, and careless."<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The number of common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_226" id="Page_3_226">[226]</a></span>
people he saw in his drive, "also riding about in
cars as hard as they could split," brought to his recollection
a more distant scene, and but for the dresses he
could have thought himself on the Toledo at Naples.</p>

<p>In respect of the number of his audience, and their
reception of him, Dublin was one of his marked successes.
He came to have some doubt of their capacity
of receiving the pathetic, but of their quickness as to
the humorous there could be no question, any more
than of their heartiness. He got on wonderfully well
with the Dublin people.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The Boots at Morrison's
expressed the general feeling in a patriotic point of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_227" id="Page_3_227">[227]</a></span>
view. "He was waiting for me at the hotel door last
night. 'Whaat sart of a hoose sur?' he asked me.
'Capital.' 'The Lard be praised fur the 'onor 'o
Dooblin!'" Within the hotel, on getting up next
morning, he had a dialogue with a smaller resident,
landlord's son he supposed, a little boy of the ripe age
of six, which he presented, in his letter to his sister-in-law,
as a colloquy between Old England and Young
Ireland inadequately reported for want of the "imitation"
it required for its full effect. "I am sitting on
the sofa, writing, and find him sitting beside me.</p>

<p>"<i>Old England.</i> Halloa old chap.</p>

<p>"<i>Young Ireland.</i> Hal&mdash;loo!</p>

<p>"<i>Old England</i> (in his delightful way). What a nice
old fellow you are. I am very fond of little boys.</p>

<p>"<i>Young Ireland.</i> Air yes? Ye'r right.</p>

<p>"<i>Old England.</i> What do you learn, old fellow?</p>

<p>"<i>Young Ireland</i> (very intent on Old England, and
always childish except in his brogue). I lairn wureds
of three sillibils&mdash;and wureds of two sillibils&mdash;and
wureds of one sillibil.</p>

<p>"<i>Old England</i> (cheerfully). Get out, you humbug!
You learn only words of one syllable.</p>

<p>"<i>Young Ireland</i> (laughs heartily). You may say that
it is mostly wureds of one sillibil.</p>

<p>"<i>Old England.</i> Can you write?</p>

<p>"<i>Young Ireland,</i> Not yet. Things comes by deegrays.</p>

<p>"<i>Old England.</i> Can you cipher?</p>

<p>"<i>Young Ireland</i> (very quickly). Whaat's that?</p>

<p>"<i>Old England.</i> Can you make figures?</p>

<p>"<i>Young Ireland.</i> I can make a nought, which is not
asy, being roond.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_228" id="Page_3_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Old England.</i> I say, old boy! Wasn't it you I saw
on Sunday morning in the Hall, in a soldier's cap?
You know!&mdash;In a soldier's cap?</p>

<p>"<i>Young Ireland</i> (cogitating deeply). Was it a very
good cap?</p>

<p>"<i>Old England.</i> Yes.</p>

<p>"<i>Young Ireland.</i> Did it fit ankommon?</p>

<p>"<i>Old England.</i> Yes.</p>

<p>"<i>Young Ireland.</i> Dat was me!"</p>

<p>The last night in Dublin was an extraordinary scene.
"You can hardly imagine it. All the way from the
hotel to the Rotunda (a mile), I had to contend against
the stream of people who were turned away. When
I got there, they had broken the glass in the pay-boxes,
and were offering &pound;5 freely for a stall. Half of my
platform had to be taken down, and people heaped in
among the ruins. You never saw such a scene."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> But
he would not return after his other Irish engagements.
"I have positively said No. The work is too hard. It
is not like doing it in one easy room, and always the
same room. With a different place every night, and a
different audience with its own peculiarity every night,
it is a tremendous strain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I seem to be always
either in a railway carriage or reading, or going to
bed; and I get so knocked up whenever I have a minute
to remember it, that then I go to bed as a matter
of course."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_229" id="Page_3_229">[229]</a></span></p>
<p>Belfast he liked quite as much as Dublin in another
way. "A fine place with a rough people; everything
looking prosperous; the railway ride from Dublin quite
amazing in the order, neatness, and cleanness of all
you see; every cottage looking as if it had been whitewashed
the day before; and many with charming gardens,
prettily kept with bright flowers." The success,
too, was quite as great. "Enormous audiences. We
turn away half the town.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> I think them a better audience
on the whole than Dublin; and the personal affection
is something overwhelming. I wish you and the
dear girls" (he is writing to his sister-in-law) "could
have seen the people look at me in the street; or heard
them ask me, as I hurried to the hotel after the reading
last night, to 'do me the honor to shake hands Misther
Dickens and God bless you sir; not ounly for the light
you've been to me this night, but for the light you've
been in mee house sir (and God love your face!) this
many a year!'"<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> He had never seen men "go in to
cry so undisguisedly," as they did at the Belfast <i>Dombey</i>
reading; and as to the <i>Boots</i> and <i>Mrs. Gamp</i> "it
was just one roar with me and them. For they made
me laugh so, that sometimes I <i>could not</i> compose my
face to go on." His greatest trial in this way however<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_230" id="Page_3_230">[230]</a></span>
was a little later at Harrogate&mdash;"the queerest place,
with the strangest people in it, leading the oddest lives
of dancing, newspaper-reading, and tables d'h&ocirc;te"&mdash;where
he noticed, at the same reading, embodiments
respectively of the tears and laughter to which he has
moved his fellow creatures so largely. "There was
one gentleman at the <i>Little Dombey</i> yesterday morning"
(he is still writing to his sister-in-law) "who
exhibited&mdash;or rather concealed&mdash;the profoundest grief.
After crying a good deal without hiding it, he covered
his face with both his hands, and laid it down on the
back of the seat before him, and really shook with
emotion. He was not in mourning, but I supposed
him to have lost some child in old time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There
was a remarkably good fellow too, of thirty or so, who
found something so very ludicrous in Toots that he
<i>could not</i> compose himself at all, but laughed until he
sat wiping his eyes with his handkerchief; and whenever
he felt Toots coming again, he began to laugh
and wipe his eyes afresh; and when Toots came once
more, he gave a kind of cry, as if it were too much for
him. It was uncommonly droll, and made me laugh
heartily."</p>

<p>At Harrogate he read twice on one day (a Saturday),
and had to engage a special engine to take him
back that night to York, which, having reached at one
o'clock in the morning, he had to leave, because of
Sunday restrictions on travel, the same morning at
half-past four, to enable him to fulfil a Monday's reading
at Scarborough. Such fatigues became matters of
course; but their effect, not noted at the time, was
grave. "At York I had a most magnificent audience,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_231" id="Page_3_231">[231]</a></span>
and might have filled the place for a week.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
think the audience possessed of a better knowledge of
character than any I have seen. But I recollect Doctor
Belcombe to have told me long ago that they first
found out Charles Mathews's father, and to the last
understood him (he used to say) better than any other
people.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The let is enormous for next Saturday at
Manchester, stalls alone four hundred! I shall soon
be able to send you the list of places to the 15th of
November, the end. I shall be, O most heartily glad,
when that time comes! But I must say that the intelligence
and warmth of the audiences are an immense
sustainment, and one that always sets me up. Sometimes
before I go down to read (especially when it is
in the day), I am so oppressed by having to do it that
I feel perfectly unequal to the task. But the people
lift me out of this directly; and I find that I have
quite forgotten everything but them and the book, in
a quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>The reception that awaited him at Manchester had
very special warmth in it, occasioned by an adverse
tone taken in the comment of one of the Manchester
daily papers on the letter which by a breach of confidence
had been then recently printed. "My violated
letter" Dickens always called it. "When I came to
Manchester on Saturday I found seven hundred stalls
taken! When I went into the room at night 2500
people had paid, and more were being turned away
from every door. The welcome they gave me was
astounding in its affectionate recognition of the late
trouble, and fairly for once unmanned me. I never
saw such a sight or heard such a sound. When they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_232" id="Page_3_232">[232]</a></span>
had thoroughly done it, they settled down to enjoy
themselves; and certainly did enjoy themselves most
heartily to the last minute." Nor, for the rest of his
English tour, in any of the towns that remained, had
he reason to complain of any want of hearty greeting.
At Sheffield great crowds came in excess of the places.
At Leeds the hall overflowed in half an hour. At Hull
the vast concourse had to be addressed by Mr. Smith
on the gallery stairs, and additional Readings had to
be given, day and night, "for the people out of town
and for the people in town."</p>

<p>The net profit to himself, thus far, had been upwards
of three hundred pounds a week;<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> but this was nothing
to the success in Scotland, where his profit in a week,
with all expenses paid, was five hundred pounds. The
pleasure was enhanced, too, by the presence of his two
daughters, who had joined him over the Border. At
first the look of Edinburgh was not promising. "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_233" id="Page_3_233">[233]</a></span>
began with, for us, a poor room.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But the effect of
that reading (it was the <i>Chimes</i>) was immense; and on
the next night, for <i>Little Dombey</i>, we had a full room.
It is our greatest triumph everywhere. Next night
(<i>Poor Traveller</i>, <i>Boots</i>, and <i>Gamp</i>) we turned away
hundreds upon hundreds of people; and last night, for
the <i>Carol</i>, in spite of advertisements in the morning
that the tickets were gone, the people had to be got in
through such a crowd as rendered it a work of the
utmost difficulty to keep an alley into the room. They
were seated about me on the platform, put into the
doorway of the waiting-room, squeezed into every conceivable
place, and a multitude turned away once more.
I think I am better pleased with what was done in
Edinburgh than with what has been done anywhere,
almost. It was so completely taken by storm, and
carried in spite of itself. Mary and Katey have been
infinitely pleased and interested with Edinburgh. We
are just going to sit down to dinner and therefore I cut
my missive short. Travelling, dinner, reading, and
everything else, come crowding together into this
strange life."</p>

<p>Then came Dundee: "An odd place," he wrote,
"like Wapping with high rugged hills behind it. We
had the strangest journey here&mdash;bits of sea, and bits
of railroad, alternately; which carried my mind back
to travelling in America. The room is an immense
new one, belonging to Lord Kinnaird, and Lord Panmure,
and some others of that sort. It looks something
between the Crystal-palace and Westminster-hall
(I can't imagine who wants it in this place), and has
never been tried yet for speaking in. Quite disinterestedly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_234" id="Page_3_234">[234]</a></span>
of course, I hope it will succeed." The people
he thought, in respect of taste and intelligence, below
any other of his Scotch audiences; but they woke up
surprisingly, and the rest of his Caledonian tour was
a succession of triumphs. "At Aberdeen we were
crammed to the street, twice in one day. At Perth
(where I thought when I arrived, there literally could
be nobody to come) the gentlefolk came posting in
from thirty miles round, and the whole town came
besides, and filled an immense hall. They were as full
of perception, fire, and enthusiasm as any people I
have seen. At Glasgow, where I read three evenings
and one morning, we took the prodigiously large sum
of six hundred pounds! And this at the Manchester
prices, which are lower than St. Martin's Hall. As to
the effect&mdash;I wish you could have seen them after Lilian
died in the <i>Chimes</i>, or when Scrooge woke in the
<i>Carol</i> and talked to the boy outside the window. And
at the end of <i>Dombey</i> yesterday afternoon, in the cold
light of day, they all got up, after a short pause, gentle
and simple, and thundered and waved their hats with
such astonishing heartiness and fondness that, for the
first time in all my public career, they took me completely
off my legs, and I saw the whole eighteen hundred
of them reel to one side as if a shock from without
had shaken the hall. Notwithstanding which, I must
confess to you, I am very anxious to get to the end of
my Readings, and to be at home again, and able to sit
down and think in my own study. There has been only
one thing quite without alloy. The dear girls have
enjoyed themselves immensely, and their trip with me
has been a great success."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_235" id="Page_3_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>The subjects of his readings during this first circuit
were the <i>Carol</i>, the <i>Chimes</i>, the <i>Trial in Pickwick</i>, the
chapters containing <i>Paul Dombey</i>, <i>Boots at the Holly
Tree Inn</i>, the <i>Poor Traveller</i> (Captain Doubledick),
and <i>Mrs. Gamp:</i> to which he continued to restrict
himself through the supplementary nights that closed
in the autumn of 1859.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Of these the most successful
in their uniform effect upon his audiences were undoubtedly
the <i>Carol</i>, the <i>Pickwick</i> scene, <i>Mrs. Gamp</i>,
and the <i>Dombey</i>&mdash;the quickness, variety, and completeness
of his assumption of character, having greatest
scope in these. Here, I think, more than in the pathos
or graver level passages, his strength lay; but this is
entitled to no weight other than as an individual
opinion, and his audiences gave him many reasons for
thinking differently.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>The incidents of the period covered by this chapter
that had any general interest in them, claim to be
mentioned briefly. At the close of 1857 he presided
at the fourth anniversary of the Warehousemen and
Clerks' Schools, describing and discriminating, with
keenest wit and kindliest fun, the sort of schools he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_236" id="Page_3_236">[236]</a></span>
liked and he disliked. To the spring and summer of
1858 belongs the first collection of his writings into a
succinct library form, each of the larger novels occupying
two volumes. In March he paid warm public
tribute to Thackeray (who had been induced to take
the chair at the General Theatrical Fund) as one for
whose genius he entertained the warmest admiration,
who did honour to literature, and in whom literature
was honoured. In May he presided at the Artists'
Benevolent Fund dinner, and made striking appeal for
that excellent charity. In July he took earnest part in
the opening efforts on behalf of the Royal Dramatic
College, which he supplemented later by a speech for
the establishment of schools for actors' children; in
which he took occasion to declare his belief that there
were no institutions in England so socially liberal as
its public schools, and that there was nowhere in the
country so complete an absence of servility to mere
rank, position, or riches. "A boy, there, is always
what his abilities or his personal qualities make him.
We may differ about the curriculum and other matters,
but of the frank, free, manly, independent spirit preserved
in our public schools, I apprehend there can be
no kind of question." In December<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> he was entertained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_237" id="Page_3_237">[237]</a></span>
at a public dinner in Coventry on the occasion
of receiving, by way of thanks for help rendered to
their Institute, a gold repeater of special construction
by the watchmakers of the town; as to which he kept
faithfully his pledge to the givers, that it should be
thenceforward the inseparable companion of his workings
and wanderings, and reckon off the future labours
of his days until he should have done with the measurement
of time. Within a day from this celebration, he
presided at the Institutional Association of Lancashire
and Cheshire in Manchester Free Trade Hall; gave
prizes to candidates from a hundred and fourteen local
mechanics' institutes affiliated to the Association; described
in his most attractive language the gallant
toiling fellows by whom the prizes had been won;
and ended with the monition he never failed to couple
with his eulogies of Knowledge, that it should follow
the teaching of the Saviour, and not satisfy the understanding
merely. "Knowledge has a very limited
power when it informs the head only; but when it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_238" id="Page_3_238">[238]</a></span>
informs the heart as well, it has a power over life and
death, the body and the soul, and dominates the universe."</p>

<p>This too was the year when Mr. Frith completed
Dickens's portrait, and it appeared upon the walls of
the Academy in the following spring. "I wish," said
Edwin Landseer as he stood before it, "he looked less
eager and busy, and not so much out of himself, or beyond
himself. I should like to catch him asleep and
quiet now and then." There is something in the objection,
and he also would be envious at times of what
he too surely knew could never be his lot. On the
other hand who would willingly have lost the fruits of
an activity on the whole so healthy and beneficent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the interval before the close of the first circuit of
readings, painful personal disputes arising out of the
occurrences of the previous year were settled by the
discontinuance of <i>Household Words</i>, and the establishment
in its place of <i>All the Year Round</i>. The disputes
turned upon matters of feeling exclusively, and involved
no charge on either side that would render any detailed
reference here other than gravely out of place. The
question into which the difference ultimately resolved
itself was that of the respective rights of the parties as
proprietors of <i>Household Words;</i> and this, upon a bill
filed in Chancery, was settled by a winding-up order,
under which the property was sold. It was bought by
Dickens, who, even before the sale, exactly fulfilling a
previous announcement of the proposed discontinuance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_240" id="Page_3_240">[240]</a></span>
of the existing periodical and establishment of another
in its place, precisely similar but under a different title,
had started <i>All the Year Round</i>. It was to be regretted
perhaps that he should have thought it necessary to
move at all, but he moved strictly within his rights.</p>

<p>To the publishers first associated with his great success
in literature, Messrs. Chapman and Hall, he now
returned for the issue of the remainder of his books;
of which he always in future reserved the copyrights,
making each the subject of such arrangement as for the
time might seem to him desirable. In this he was met
by no difficulty; and indeed it will be only proper to
add, that, in any points affecting his relations with those
concerned in the production of his books, though his
resentments were easily and quickly roused, they were
never very lasting. The only fair rule therefore was, in
a memoir of his life, to confine the mention of such
things to what was strictly necessary to explain its narrative.
This accordingly has been done; and, in the
several disagreements it has been necessary to advert to,
I cannot charge myself with having in a single instance
overstepped the rule. Objection has been made to my
revival of the early differences with Mr. Bentley. But
silence respecting them was incompatible with what
absolutely required to be said, if the picture of Dickens
in his most interesting time, at the outset of his career
in letters, was not to be omitted altogether; and, suppressing
everything of mere temper that gathered round
the dispute, use was made of those letters only containing
the young writer's urgent appeal to be absolved,
rightly or wrongly, from engagements he had too precipitately
entered into. Wrongly, some might say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_241" id="Page_3_241">[241]</a></span>
because the law was undoubtedly on Mr. Bentley's
side; but all subsequent reflection has confirmed the
view I was led strongly to take at the time, that in the
facts there had come to be involved what the law could
not afford to overlook, and that the sale of brain-work
can never be adjusted by agreement with the same exactness
and certainty as that of ordinary goods and
chattels. Quitting the subject once for all with this
remark, it is not less incumbent on me to say that there
was no stage of the dispute in which Mr. Bentley, holding
as strongly the other view, might not think it to
have sufficient justification; and certainly in later years
there was no absence of friendly feeling on the part of
Dickens to his old publisher. This already has been
mentioned; and on the occasion of Hans Andersen's
recent visit to Gadshill, Mr. Bentley was invited to
meet the celebrated Dane. Nor should I omit to say,
that, in the year to which this narrative has now arrived,
his prompt compliance with an intercession made to
him for a common friend pleased Dickens greatly.</p>

<p>At the opening of 1859, bent upon such a successor
to <i>Household Words</i> as should carry on the associations
connected with its name, Dickens was deep in search
of a title to give expression to them. "My determination
to settle the title arises out of my knowledge that
I shall never be able to do anything for the work until
it has a fixed name; also out of my observation that the
same odd feeling affects everybody else." He had proposed
to himself a title that, as in <i>Household Words</i>,
might be capable of illustration by a line from Shakespeare;
and alighting upon that wherein poor Henry the
Sixth is fain to solace his captivity by the fancy, that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_242" id="Page_3_242">[242]</a></span>
like birds encaged he might soothe himself for loss of
liberty "at last by notes of household harmony," he
for the time forgot that this might hardly be accepted
as a happy comment on the occurrences out of which
the supposed necessity had arisen of replacing the old
by a new household friend. "Don't you think," he
wrote on the 24th of January, "this is a good name
and quotation? I have been quite delighted to get
hold of it for our title.</p>

<div class='center'>
"HOUSEHOLD HARMONY.<br />
<br />
"'At last by notes of Household Harmony.'&mdash;<i>Shakespeare.</i>"<br />
</div>

<p>He was at first reluctant even to admit the objection
when stated to him. "I am afraid we must not be too
particular about the possibility of personal references
and applications: otherwise it is manifest that I never
can write another book. I could not invent a story of
any sort, it is quite plain, incapable of being twisted
into some such nonsensical shape. It would be wholly
impossible to turn one through half a dozen chapters."
Of course he yielded, nevertheless; and much consideration
followed over sundry other titles submitted.
Reviving none of those formerly rejected, here were a
few of these now rejected in their turn. <span class="smcap">The Hearth.
The Forge. The Crucible. The Anvil of the
Time. Charles Dickens's Own. Seasonable Leaves.
Evergreen Leaves. Home. Home-Music. Change.
Time and Tide. Twopence. English Bells. Weekly
Bells. The Rocket. Good Humour.</span> Still the
great want was the line adaptable from Shakespeare,
which at last exultingly he sent on the 28th of January.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_243" id="Page_3_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am dining early, before reading, and write literally
with my mouth full. But I have just hit upon a name
that I think really an admirable one&mdash;especially with
the quotation <i>before</i> it, in the place where our present
<i>H. W.</i> quotation stands.</p>

<div class='center'>
"'The story of our lives, from year to year.'&mdash;<i>Shakespeare.</i>"<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">All the Year Round.</span><br />

</div>

<p>With the same resolution and energy other things
necessary to the adventure were as promptly done.
"I have taken the new office," he wrote from Tavistock
House on the 21st of February; "have got
workmen in; have ordered the paper; settled with the
printer; and am getting an immense system of advertising
ready. Blow to be struck on the 12th of March.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Meantime I cannot please myself with the opening
of my story" (the <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>, which <i>All the
Year Round</i> was to start with), "and cannot in the
least settle at it or take to it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wish you would
come and look at what I flatter myself is a rather
ingenious account to which I have turned the Stanfield
scenery here." He had placed the <i>Lighthouse</i> scene
in a single frame; had divided the scene of the <i>Frozen
Deep</i> into two subjects, a British man-of-war and an
Arctic sea, which he had also framed; and the school-room
that had been the theatre was now hung with
sea-pieces by a great painter of the sea. To believe
them to have been but the amusement of a few mornings
was difficult indeed. Seen from the due distance
there was nothing wanting to the most masterly and
elaborate art.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_244" id="Page_3_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>The first number of <i>All the Year Round</i> appeared on
the 30th of April, and the result of the first quarter's
accounts of the sale will tell everything that needs to
be said of a success that went on without intermission
to the close. "A word before I go back to Gadshill,"
he wrote from Tavistock House in July, "which I
know you will be glad to receive. So well has <i>All the
Year Round</i> gone that it was yesterday able to repay
me, with five per cent. interest, all the money I advanced
for its establishment (paper, print &amp;c. all paid, down
to the last number), and yet to leave a good &pound;500
balance at the banker's!" Beside the opening of his
<i>Tale of Two Cities</i> its first number had contained
another piece of his writing, the "Poor Man and his
Beer;" as to which an interesting note has been sent
me. The Rev. T. B. Lawes, of Rothamsted, St.
Alban's, had been associated upon a sanitary commission
with Mr. Henry Austin, Dickens's brother-in-law
and counsellor in regard to all such matters in his
own houses, or in the houses of the poor; and this connection
led to Dickens's knowledge of a club that Mr.
Lawes had established at Rothamsted, which he became
eager to recommend as an example to other country
neighbourhoods. The club had been set on foot<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> to
enable the agricultural labourers of the parish to have
their beer and pipes independent of the public-house;
and the description of it, says Mr. Lawes, "was the
occupation of a drive between this place (Rothamsted)
and London, 25 miles, Mr. Dickens refusing the offer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_245" id="Page_3_245">[245]</a></span>
of a bed, and saying that he could arrange his ideas
on the journey. In the course of our conversation I
mentioned that the labourers were very jealous of the
small tradesmen, blacksmiths and others, holding allotment-gardens;
but that the latter did so indirectly by
paying higher rents to the labourers for a share. This
circumstance is not forgotten in the verses on the
Blacksmith in the same number, composed by Mr.
Dickens and repeated to me while he was walking
about, and which close the mention of his gains with
allusion to</p>

<div class='poem'><br />
"A share (concealed) in the poor man's field,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Which adds to the poor man's store."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The periodical thus established was in all respects,
save one, so exactly the counterpart of what it replaced,
that a mention of this point of difference is the only
description of it called for. Besides his own three-volume
stories of <i>The Tale of Two Cities</i> and <i>Great
Expectations</i>, Dickens admitted into it other stories of
the same length by writers of character and name, of
which the authorship was avowed. It published tales
of varied merit and success by Mr. Edmund Yates, Mr.
Percy Fitzgerald, and Mr. Charles Lever. Mr. Wilkie
Collins contributed to it his <i>Woman in White</i>, <i>No
Name</i>, and <i>Moonstone</i>, the first of which had a pre-eminent
success; Mr. Reade his <i>Hard Cash;</i> and
Lord Lytton his <i>Strange Story</i>. Conferring about the
latter Dickens passed a week at Knebworth, accompanied
by his daughter and sister-in-law, in the summer
of 1861, as soon as he had closed <i>Great Expectations;</i>
and there met Mr. Arthur Helps, with whom and Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_246" id="Page_3_246">[246]</a></span>
Orford he visited the so-called "Hermit" near Stevenage,
whom he described as Mr. Mopes in <i>Tom Tiddler's
Ground</i>. With his great brother-artist he thoroughly
enjoyed himself, as he invariably did; and reported
him as "in better health and spirits than I have seen
him in, in all these years,&mdash;a little weird occasionally
regarding magic and spirits, but always fair and frank
under opposition. He was brilliantly talkative, anecdotical,
and droll; looked young and well; laughed
heartily; and enjoyed with great zest some games we
played. In his artist-character and talk, he was full
of interest and matter, saying the subtlest and finest
things&mdash;but that he never fails in. I enjoyed myself
immensely, as we all did."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>In <i>All the Year Round</i>, as in its predecessor, the
tales for Christmas were of course continued, but with
a surprisingly increased popularity; and Dickens never
had such sale for any of his writings as for his Christmas
pieces in the later periodical. It had reached,
before he died, to nearly three hundred thousand. The
first was called the <i>Haunted House</i>, and had a small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_247" id="Page_3_247">[247]</a></span>
mention of a true occurrence in his boyhood which is
not included in the bitter record on a former page. "I
was taken home, and there was debt at home as well as
death, and we had a sale there. My own little bed
was so superciliously looked upon by a power unknown
to me hazily called The Trade, that a brass coal-scuttle,
a roasting jack, and a bird cage were obliged to be put
into it to make a lot of it, and then it went for a song.
So I heard mentioned, and I wondered what song, and
thought what a dismal song it must have been to
sing!" The other subjects will have mention in another
chapter.</p>

<p>His tales were not his only important work in <i>All
the Year Round</i>. The detached papers written by him
there had a character and completeness derived from
their plan, and from the personal tone, as well as frequent
individual confessions, by which their interest
is enhanced, and which will always make them specially
attractive. Their title expressed a personal liking.
Of all the societies, charitable or self-assisting, which
his tact and eloquence in the "chair" so often helped,
none had interested him by the character of its service
to its members, and the perfection of its management,
so much as that of the Commercial Travellers. His,
admiration of their schools introduced him to one who
then acted as their treasurer, and whom, of all the men
he had known, I think he rated highest for the union
of business qualities in an incomparable measure to a
nature comprehensive enough to deal with masses of
men, however differing in creed or opinion, humanely
and justly. He never afterwards wanted support for
any good work that he did not think first of Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_248" id="Page_3_248">[248]</a></span>
George Moore,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and appeal was never made to him in
vain. "Integrity, enterprise, public spirit, and benevolence,"
he told the Commercial Travellers on one
occasion, "had their synonym in Mr. Moore's name;"
and it was another form of the same liking when he
took to himself the character and title of a Traveller
<i>Un</i>commercial. "I am both a town traveller and a
country traveller, and am always on the road. Figuratively
speaking, I travel for the great house of
Human-interest Brothers, and have rather a large connection
in the fancy goods way. Literally speaking, I
am always wandering here and there from my rooms
in Covent-garden, London: now about the city streets;
now about the country by-roads: seeing many little
things, and some great things, which, because they interest
me, I think may interest others." In a few
words that was the plan and drift of the papers which
he began in 1860, and continued to write from time
to time until the last autumn of his life.</p>

<p>Many of them, such as "Travelling Abroad," "City
Churches," "Dullborough," "Nurses' Stories," and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_249" id="Page_3_249">[249]</a></span>
"Birthday Celebrations," have supplied traits, chiefly
of his younger days, to portions of this memoir; and
parts of his later life receive illustration from others,
such as "Tramps," "Night Walks," "Shy Neighbourhoods,"
"The Italian Prisoner," and "Chatham
Dockyard." Indeed hardly any is without its personal
interest or illustration. One may learn from them,
among other things, what kind of treatment he resorted
to for the disorder of sleeplessness from which
he had often suffered amid his late anxieties. Experimenting
upon it in bed, he found to be too slow
and doubtful a process for him; but he very soon defeated
his enemy by the brisker treatment, of getting
up directly after lying down, going out, and coming
home tired at sunrise. "My last special feat was
turning out of bed at two, after a hard day pedestrian
and otherwise, and walking thirty miles into the country
to breakfast." One description he did not give in
his paper, but I recollect his saying that he had seldom
seen anything so striking as the way in which the
wonders of an equinoctial dawn (it was the 15th of
October 1857) presented themselves during that walk.
He had never before happened to see night so completely
at odds with morning, "which was which."
Another experience of his night ramblings used to be
given in vivid sketches of the restlessness of a great
city, and the manner in which <i>it</i> also tumbles and
tosses before it can get to sleep. Nor should anyone
curious about his habits and ways omit to accompany
him with his Tramps into Gadshill lanes; or to follow
him into his Shy Neighbourhoods of the Hackney-road,
Waterloo-road, Spitalfields, or Bethnal-green. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_250" id="Page_3_250">[250]</a></span>
delightful observation both of country and town, for
the wit that finds analogies between remote and familiar
things, and for humorous personal sketches and
experience, these are perfect of their kind.</p>

<p>"I have my eye upon a piece of Kentish road, bordered
on either side by a wood, and having on one
hand, between the road-dust and the trees, a skirting
patch of grass. Wild flowers grow in abundance on
this spot, and it lies high and airy, with a distant river
stealing steadily away to the ocean, like a man's life.
To gain the mile-stone here, which the moss, primroses,
violets, blue-bells, and wild roses, would soon
render illegible but for peering travellers pushing them
aside with their sticks, you must come up a steep hill,
come which way you may. So, all the tramps with
carts or caravans&mdash;the Gipsy-tramp, the Show-tramp,
the Cheap Jack&mdash;find it impossible to resist the temptations
of the place; and all turn the horse loose when
they come to it, and boil the pot. Bless the place, I
love the ashes of the vagabond fires that have scorched
its grass!" It was there he found Dr. Marigold, and
Chops the Dwarf, and the White-haired Lady with the
pink eyes eating meat-pie with the Giant. So, too, in
his Shy Neighbourhoods, when he relates his experiences
of the bad company that birds are fond of, and
of the effect upon domestic fowls of living in low districts,
his method of handling the subject has all the
charm of a discovery. "That anything born of an
egg and invested with wings should have got to the
pass that it hops contentedly down a ladder into a
cellar, and calls <i>that</i> going home, is a circumstance
so amazing as to leave one nothing more in this connexion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_251" id="Page_3_251">[251]</a></span>
to wonder at." One of his illustrations is a
reduced Bantam family in the Hackney-road deriving
their sole enjoyment from crowding together in a
pawnbroker's side-entry; but seeming as if only newly
come down in the world, and always in a feeble flutter
of fear that they may be found out. He contrasts them
with others. "I know a low fellow, originally of a
good family from Dorking, who takes his whole establishment
of wives, in single file, in at the door of the
Jug Department of a disorderly tavern near the Haymarket,
man&#339;uvres them among the company's legs,
emerges with them at the Bottle Entrance, and so
passes his life: seldom, in the season, going to bed
before two in the morning.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But, the family I am
best acquainted with, reside in the densest part of Bethnal-green.
Their abstraction from the objects among
which they live, or rather their conviction that those
objects have all come into existence in express subservience
to fowls, has so enchanted me, that I have
made them the subject of many journeys at divers
hours. After careful observation of the two lords and
the ten ladies of whom this family consists, I have
come to the conclusion that their opinions are represented
by the leading lord and leading lady: the latter,
as I judge, an aged personage, afflicted with a
paucity of feather and visibility of quill that gives her
the appearance of a bundle of office pens. When a
railway goods-van that would crush an elephant comes
round the corner, tearing over these fowls, they emerge
unharmed from under the horses, perfectly satisfied
that the whole rush was a passing property in the air,
which may have left something to eat behind it. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_252" id="Page_3_252">[252]</a></span>
look upon old shoes, wrecks of kettles and saucepans,
and fragments of bonnets, as a kind of meteoric discharge,
for fowls to peck at.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Gaslight comes quite
as natural to them as any other light; and I have more
than a suspicion that, in the minds of the two lords,
the early public-house at the corner has superseded the
sun. They always begin to crow when the public-house
shutters begin to be taken down, and they salute the
Potboy, the instant he appears to perform that duty,
as if he were Ph&#339;bes in person." For the truth of the
personal adventure in the same essay, which he tells in
proof of a propensity to bad company in more refined
members of the feathered race, I am myself in a position
to vouch. Walking by a dirty court in Spitalfields
one day, the quick little busy intelligence of a goldfinch,
drawing water for himself in his cage, so attracted
him that he bought the bird, which had other accomplishments;
but not one of them would the little creature
show off in his new abode in Doughty-street, and
he drew no water but by stealth or under the cloak of
night. "After an interval of futile and at length hopeless
expectation, the merchant who had educated him
was appealed to. The merchant was a bow-legged character,
with a flat and cushiony nose, like the last new
strawberry. He wore a fur cap, and shorts, and was of
the velveteen race, velveteeny. He sent word that he
would 'look round.' He looked round, appeared in
the doorway of the room, and slightly cocked up his evil
eye at the goldfinch. Instantly a raging thirst beset
that bird; and when it was appeased, he still drew several
unnecessary buckets of water, leaping about his perch
and sharpening his bill with irrepressible satisfaction."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_253" id="Page_3_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>The Uncommercial Traveller papers, his two serial
stories, and his Christmas tales, were all the contributions
of any importance made by Dickens to <i>All the
Year Round;</i> but he reprinted in it, on the completion
of his first story, a short tale called "Hunted Down,"
written for a newspaper in America called the <i>New
York Ledger</i>. Its subject had been taken from the life
of a notorious criminal already named, and its principal
claim to notice was the price paid for it. For a
story not longer than half of one of the numbers of
<i>Chuzzlewit</i> or <i>Copperfield</i>, he had received a thousand
pounds.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> It was one of the indications of the eager
desire which his entry on the career of a public reader
had aroused in America to induce him again to visit
that continent; and at the very time he had this magnificent
offer from the New York journal, Mr. Fields
of Boston, who was then on a visit to Europe, was
pressing him so much to go that his resolution was
almost shaken. "I am now," he wrote to me from
Gadshill on the 9th of July 1859, "getting the <i>Tale of
Two Cities</i> into that state that IF I should decide to go
to America late in September, I could turn to, at any
time, and write on with great vigour. Mr. Fields has
been down here for a day, and with the strongest intensity
urges that there is no drawback, no commercial
excitement or crisis, no political agitation; and that
so favourable an opportunity, in all respects, might not
occur again for years and years. I should be one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_254" id="Page_3_254">[254]</a></span>
the most unhappy of men if I were to go, and yet I
cannot help being much stirred and influenced by the
golden prospect held before me."</p>

<p>He yielded nevertheless to other persuasion, and for
that time the visit was not to be. In six months more
the Civil War began, and America was closed to any
such enterprise for nearly five years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the end of the first year of residence at Gadshill
it was the remark of Dickens that nothing had gratified
him so much as the confidence with which his poorer
neighbours treated him. He had tested generally their
worth and good conduct, and they had been encouraged
in illness or trouble to resort to him for help.
There was pleasant indication of the feeling thus
awakened, when, in the summer of 1860, his younger
daughter Kate was married to Charles Alston Collins,
brother of the novelist, and younger son of the painter
and academician, who might have found, if spared to
witness that summer-morning scene, subjects not unworthy
of his delightful pencil in many a rustic group<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_256" id="Page_3_256">[256]</a></span>
near Gadshill. All the villagers had turned out in
honour of Dickens, and the carriages could hardly get
to and from the little church for the succession of triumphal
arches they had to pass through. It was quite
unexpected by him; and when the feu de joie of the
blacksmith in the lane, whose enthusiasm had smuggled
a couple of small cannon into his forge, exploded upon
him at the return, I doubt if the shyest of men was
ever so taken aback at an ovation.</p>

<p>To name the principal persons present that day will
indicate the faces that (with addition of Miss Mary
Boyle, Miss Marguerite Power, Mr. Fechter, Mr.
Charles Kent, Mr. Edmund Yates, Mr. Percy Fitzgerald,
and members of the family of Mr. Frank Stone,
whose sudden death<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> in the preceding year had been a
great grief to Dickens) were most familiar at Gadshill
in these later years. Mr. Frederic Lehmann was there
with his wife, whose sister, Miss Chambers, was one of
the bridesmaids; Mr. and Mrs. Wills were there, and
Dickens's old fast friend Mr. Thomas Beard; the two
nearest country neighbours with whom the family had
become very intimate, Mr. Hulkes and Mr. Malleson,
with their wives, joined the party; among the others
were Henry Chorley, Chauncy Townshend, and Wilkie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_257" id="Page_3_257">[257]</a></span>
Collins; and, for friend special to the occasion, the
bridegroom had brought his old fellow-student in art,
Mr. Holman Hunt. Mr. Charles Collins had himself
been bred as a painter, for success in which line he had
some rare gifts; but inclination and capacity led him
also to literature, and, after much indecision between
the two callings, he took finally to letters. His contributions
to <i>All the Year Round</i> were among the most
charming of its detached papers, and two stories published
independently showed strength of wing for
higher flights. But his health broke down, and his
taste was too fastidious for his failing power. It is
possible however that he may live by two small books
of description, the <i>New Sentimental Journey</i> and the
<i>Cruize on Wheels</i>, which have in them unusual delicacy
and refinement of humour; and if those volumes should
make any readers in another generation curious about
the writer, they will learn, if correct reply is given to
their inquiries, that no man disappointed so many reasonable
hopes with so little fault or failure of his own,
that his difficulty always was to please himself, and that
an inferior mind would have been more successful in
both the arts he followed. He died in 1873 in his
forty-fifth year; and until then it was not known, even
by those nearest to him, how great must have been the
suffering which he had borne, through many trying
years, with uncomplaining patience.</p>

<p>His daughter's marriage was the chief event that had
crossed the even tenor of Dickens's life since his first
paid readings closed; and it was followed by the sale
of Tavistock House, with the resolve to make his
future home at Gadshill. In the brief interval (29th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_258" id="Page_3_258">[258]</a></span>
of July) he wrote to me of his brother Alfred's death.
"I was telegraphed for to Manchester on Friday night.
Arrived there at a quarter past ten, but he had been
dead three hours, poor fellow! He is to be buried at
Highgate on Wednesday. I brought the poor young
widow back with me yesterday." All that this death
involved,<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> the troubles of his change of home, and
some difficulties in working out his story, gave him
more than sufficient occupation till the following
spring; and as the time arrived for the new Readings,
the change was a not unwelcome one.</p>

<p>The first portion of this second series was planned
by Mr. Arthur Smith, but he only superintended the
six readings in London which opened it. These were
the first at St. James's Hall (St. Martin's Hall having
been burnt since the last readings there) and were
given in March and April 1861. "We are all well
here and flourishing," he wrote to me from Gadshill
on the 28th of April. "On the 18th I finished the
readings as I purposed. We had between seventy and
eighty pounds <i>in the stalls</i>, which, at four shillings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_259" id="Page_3_259">[259]</a></span>
apiece, is something quite unprecedented in these
times.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The result of the six was, that, after paying
a large staff of men and all other charges, and Arthur
Smith's ten per cent. on the receipts, and replacing
everything destroyed in the fire at St. Martin's Hall
(including all our tickets, country-baggage, cheque-boxes,
books, and a quantity of gas-fittings and what
not), I got upwards of &pound;500. A very great result.
We certainly might have gone on through the season,
but I am heartily glad to be concentrated on my
story."</p>

<p>It had been part of his plan that the Provincial
Readings should not begin until a certain interval after
the close of his story of <i>Great Expectations</i>. They
were delayed accordingly until the 28th of October,
from which date, when they opened at Norwich, they
went on with the Christmas intervals to be presently
named to the 30th of January 1862, when they closed
at Chester. Kept within England and Scotland, they
took in the border town of Berwick, and, besides the
Scotch cities, comprised the contrasts and varieties of
Norwich and Lancaster, Bury St. Edmunds and Cheltenham,
Carlisle and Hastings, Plymouth and Birmingham,
Canterbury and Torquay, Preston and Ipswich,
Manchester and Brighton, Colchester and Dover,
Newcastle and Chester. They were followed by ten
readings at the St. James's Hall, between the 13th of
March and the 27th of June 1862; and by four at
Paris in January 1863, given at the Embassy in aid of
the British Charitable Fund. The second series had
thus in the number of the readings nearly equalled the
first, when it closed at London in June 1863 with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_260" id="Page_3_260">[260]</a></span>
thirteen readings in the Hanover Square Rooms; and
it is exclusively the subject of such illustrations or
references as this chapter will supply.</p>

<p>On <i>Great Expectations</i> closing in June 1861, Bulwer
Lytton, at Dickens's earnest wish, took his place in
<i>All the Year Round</i> with the "Strange Story;" and
he then indulged himself in idleness for a little while.
"The subsidence of those distressing pains in my face
the moment I had done my work, made me resolve to
do nothing in that way for some time if I could help
it."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> But his "doing nothing" was seldom more
than a figure of speech, and what it meant in this case
was soon told. "Every day for two or three hours, I
practise my new readings, and (except in my office
work) do nothing else. With great pains I have made
a continuous narrative out of <i>Copperfield</i>, that I think
will reward the exertion it is likely to cost me. Unless
I am much mistaken, it will be very valuable in London.
I have also done <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> at the Yorkshire
school, and hope I have got something droll out of
Squeers, John Browdie, &amp; Co. Also, the Bastille
prisoner from the <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>. Also, the
Dwarf from one of our Christmas numbers." Only
the first two were added to the list for the present
circuit.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of these active preparations that
painful news reached him. An illness under which
Mr. Arthur Smith had been some time suffering took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_261" id="Page_3_261">[261]</a></span>
unexpectedly a dangerous turn, and there came to be
but small chance of his recovery. A distressing interview
on the 28th of September gave Dickens little
hope. "And yet his wakings and wanderings so perpetually
turn on his arrangements for the Readings,
and he is so desperately unwilling to relinquish the
idea of 'going on with the business' to-morrow and
to-morrow and to-morrow, that I had not the heart to
press him for the papers. He told me that he believed
he had by him '70 or 80 letters unanswered.' You
may imagine how anxious it makes me, and at what a
deadstop I stand." Another week passed, and with it
the time fixed at the places where his work was to have
opened; but he could not bring himself to act as if all
hope had gone. "With a sick man who has been so
zealous and faithful, I feel bound to be very tender
and patient. When I told him the other day about
my having engaged Headland&mdash;'to do all the personally
bustling and fatiguing part of your work,' I said&mdash;he
nodded his heavy head with great satisfaction, and
faintly got out of himself the words, 'Of course I pay
him, and not you.'" The poor fellow died in October;
and on the day after attending the funeral,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_262" id="Page_3_262">[262]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
Dickens heard of the death of his brother-in-law and
friend, Mr. Henry Austin, whose abilities and character
he respected as much as he liked the man. He lost
much in losing the judicious and safe counsel which
had guided him on many public questions in which he
took lively interest, and it was with a heavy heart he
set out at last upon his second circuit. "With what
difficulty I get myself back to the readings after all
this loss and trouble, or with what unwillingness I work
myself up to the mark of looking them in the face, I
can hardly say. As for poor Arthur Smith at this
time, it is as if my right arm were gone. It is only
just now that I am able to open one of the books, and
screw the text out of myself in a flat dull way. Enclosed
is the list of what I have to do. You will see
that I have left ten days in November for the Christmas
number, and also a good Christmas margin for our
meeting at Gadshill. I shall be very glad to have the
money that I expect to get; but it will be earned."
That November interval was also the date of the marriage
of his eldest son to the daughter of Mr. Evans,
so long, in connection with Mr. Bradbury, his publisher
and printer.</p>

<p>The start of the readings at Norwich was not good,
so many changes of vexation having been incident to
the opening announcements as to leave some doubt of
their fulfilment. But the second night, when trial was
made of the <i>Nickleby</i> scenes, "we had a splendid hall,
and I think <i>Nickleby</i> will top all the readings. Somehow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_263" id="Page_3_263">[263]</a></span>
it seems to have got in it, by accident, exactly the
qualities best suited to the purpose; and it went last
night, not only with roars, but with a general hilarity
and pleasure that I have never seen surpassed."<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> From
this night onward, the success was uninterrupted, and
here was his report to me from Brighton on the 8th of
November. "We turned away half Dover and half
Hastings and half Colchester; and, if you can believe
such a thing, I may tell you that in round numbers we
find 1000 stalls already taken here in Brighton! I left
Colchester in a heavy snow-storm. To-day it is so
warm here that I can hardly bear the fire, and am writing
with the window open down to the ground. Last
night I had a most charming audience for <i>Copperfield</i>,
with a delicacy of perception that really made the work
delightful. It is very pretty to see the girls and women
generally, in the matter of Dora; and everywhere I
have found that peculiar personal relation between my
audience and myself on which I counted most when I
entered on this enterprise. <i>Nickleby</i> continues to go
in the wildest manner."</p>

<p>A storm was at this time sweeping round the coast,
and while at Dover he had written of it to his sister-in-law
(7th of November): "The bad weather has not in
the least touched us, and the storm was most magnificent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_264" id="Page_3_264">[264]</a></span>
at Dover. All the great side of the Lord Warden
next the sea had to be emptied, the break of the waves
was so prodigious, and the noise so utterly confounding.
The sea came in like a great sky of immense clouds,
for ever breaking suddenly into furious rain; all kinds
of wreck were washed in; among other things, a very
pretty brass-bound chest being thrown about like a
feather.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The unhappy Ostend packet, unable to
get in or go back, beat about the Channel all Tuesday
night, and until noon yesterday; when I saw her come
in, with five men at the wheel, a picture of misery inconceivable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The effect of the readings at Hastings
and Dover really seems to have outdone the best
usual impression; and at Dover they wouldn't go, but
sat applauding like mad. The most delicate audience
I have seen in any provincial place, is Canterbury"
("an intelligent and delightful response in them," he
wrote to his daughter, "like the touch of a beautiful
instrument"); "but the audience with the greatest
sense of humour certainly is Dover. The people in the
stalls set the example of laughing, in the most curiously
unreserved way; and they laughed with such really
cordial enjoyment, when Squeers read the boys' letters,
that the contagion extended to me. For, one couldn't
hear them without laughing too.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So, I am thankful
to say, all goes well, and the recompense for the
trouble is in every way Great."</p>

<p>From the opposite quarter of Berwick-on-Tweed he
wrote again in the midst of storm. But first his mention
of Newcastle, which he had also taken on his way
to Edinburgh, reading two nights there, should be
given. "At Newcastle, against the very heavy expenses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_265" id="Page_3_265">[265]</a></span>
I made more than a hundred guineas profit. A finer
audience there is not in England, and I suppose them
to be a specially earnest people; for, while they can
laugh till they shake the roof, they have a very unusual
sympathy with what is pathetic or passionate. An extraordinary
thing occurred on the second night. The
room was tremendously crowded and my gas-apparatus
fell down. There was a terrible wave among the people
for an instant, and God knows what destruction of life
a rush to the stairs would have caused. Fortunately a
lady in the front of the stalls ran out towards me, exactly
in a place where I knew that the whole hall could
see her. So I addressed her, laughing, and half-asked
and half-ordered her to sit down again; and, in a moment,
it was all over. But the men in attendance had
such a fearful sense of what might have happened (besides
the real danger of Fire) that they positively shook
the boards I stood on, with their trembling, when they
came up to put things right. I am proud to record
that the gas-man's sentiment, as delivered afterwards,
was, 'The more you want of the master, the more
you'll find in him.' With which complimentary
homage, and with the wind blowing so that I can
hardly hear myself write, I conclude."<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_266" id="Page_3_266">[266]</a></span></p>
<p>It was still blowing, in shape of a gale from the sea,
when, an hour before the reading, he wrote from the
King's Arms at Berwick-on-Tweed. "As odd and out
of the way a place to be at, it appears to me, as ever
was seen! And such a ridiculous room designed for
me to read in! An immense Corn Exchange, made of
glass and iron, round, dome-topp'd, lofty, utterly absurd
for any such purpose, and full of thundering
echoes; with a little lofty crow's nest of a stone gallery,
breast high, deep in the wall, into which it was
designed to put&mdash;&mdash;<i>me!</i> I instantly struck, of course;
and said I would either read in a room attached to this
house (a very snug one, capable of holding 500 people),
or not at all. Terrified local agents glowered, but fell
prostrate, and my men took the primitive accommodation
in hand. Ever since, I am alarmed to add, the
people (who besought the honour of the visit) have
been coming in numbers quite irreconcileable with the
appearance of the place, and what is to be the end I do
not know. It was poor Arthur Smith's principle that
a town on the way paid the expenses of a long through-journey,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_267" id="Page_3_267">[267]</a></span>
and therefore I came." The Reading paid
more than those expenses.</p>

<p>Enthusiastic greeting awaited him in Edinburgh.
"We had in the hall exactly double what we had on
the first night last time. The success of <i>Copperfield</i>
was perfectly unexampled. Four great rounds of applause
with a burst of cheering at the end, and every
point taken in the finest manner." But this was nothing
to what befell on the second night, when, by
some mistake of the local agents, the tickets issued
were out of proportion to the space available. Writing
from Glasgow next day (3rd of December) he described
the scene. "Such a pouring of hundreds into a place
already full to the throat, such indescribable confusion,
such a rending and tearing of dresses, and yet such a
scene of good humour on the whole, I never saw the
faintest approach to. While I addressed the crowd in
the room, G addressed the crowd in the street. Fifty
frantic men got up in all parts of the hall and addressed
me all at once. Other frantic men made speeches to the
walls. The whole B family were borne in on the top of a
wave, and landed with their faces against the front of
the platform. I read with the platform crammed with
people. I got them to lie down upon it, and it was
like some impossible tableau or gigantic pic-nic&mdash;one
pretty girl in full dress, lying on her side all night,
holding on to one of the legs of my table! It was the
most extraordinary sight. And yet, from the moment
I began to the moment of my leaving off, they never
missed a point, and they ended with a burst of cheers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The expenditure of lungs and spirits was (as you
may suppose) rather great; and to sleep well was out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_268" id="Page_3_268">[268]</a></span>
of the question. I am therefore rather fagged to-day;
and as the hall in which I read to-night is a large one,
I must make my letter a short one.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My people
were torn to ribbons last night. They have not a hat
among them&mdash;and scarcely a coat." He came home
for his Christmas rest by way of Manchester, and thus
spoke of the reading there on the 14th of December.
"<i>Copperfield</i> in the Free Trade Hall last Saturday was
really a grand scene."</p>

<p>He was in southern latitudes after Christmas, and on
the 8th of January wrote from Torquay: "We are now
in the region of small rooms, and therefore this trip
will not be as profitable as the long one. I imagine
the room here to be very small. Exeter I know, and
that is small too. I am very much used up on the
whole, for I cannot bear this moist warm climate. It
would kill me very soon. And I have now got to the
point of taking so much out of myself with <i>Copperfield</i>
that I might as well do Richard Wardour.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This
is a very pretty place&mdash;a compound of Hastings, Tunbridge
Wells, and little bits of the hills about Naples;
but I met four respirators as I came up from the station,
and three pale curates without them who seemed in a
bad way." They had been not bad omens, however.
The success was good, at both Torquay and Exeter;
and he closed the month, and this series of the country
readings, at the great towns of Liverpool and Chester.
"The beautiful St. George's Hall crowded to excess
last night" (28th of January 1862) "and numbers
turned away. Brilliant to see when lighted up, and for
a reading simply perfect. You remember that a Liverpool
audience is usually dull; but they put me on my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_269" id="Page_3_269">[269]</a></span>
mettle last night, for I never saw such an audience&mdash;no,
not even in Edinburgh! The agents (alone, and
of course without any reference to ready money at the
doors) had taken for the two readings two hundred
pounds." But as the end approached the fatigues had
told severely on him. He described himself sleeping
horribly, and with head dazed and worn by gas and
heat. Rest, before he could resume at the St. James's
Hall in March, was become an absolute necessity.</p>

<p>Two brief extracts from letters of the dates respectively
of the 8th of April<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and the 28th of June will
sufficiently describe the London readings. "The
money returns have been quite astounding. Think
of &pound;190 a night! The effect of <i>Copperfield</i> exceeds all
the expectations which its success in the country led me
to form. It seems to take people entirely by surprise.
If this is not new to you, I have not a word of news.
The rain that raineth every day seems to have washed
news away or got it under water." That was in April.
In June he wrote: "I finished my readings on Friday
night to an enormous hall&mdash;nearly &pound;200. The success
has been throughout complete. It seems almost suicidal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_270" id="Page_3_270">[270]</a></span>
to leave off with the town so full, but I don't
like to depart from my public pledge. A man from
Australia is in London ready to pay &pound;10,000 for eight
months there. If&mdash;&mdash;" It was an If that troubled
him for some time, and led to agitating discussion.
The civil war having closed America, an increase made
upon the just-named offer tempted him to Australia.
He tried to familiarize himself with the fancy that he
should thus also get new material for observation, and
he went so far as to plan an Uncommercial Traveller
Upside Down.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> It is however very doubtful if such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_271" id="Page_3_271">[271]</a></span>
a scheme would have been entertained for a moment,
but for the unwonted difficulties of invention that
were now found to beset a twenty-number story.
Such a story had lately been in his mind, and he had
just chosen the title for it (<i>Our Mutual Friend</i>); but
still he halted and hesitated sorely. "If it was not,"
(he wrote on the 5th of October 1862) "for the hope
of a gain that would make me more independent of
the worst, I could not look the travel and absence and
exertion in the face. I know perfectly well beforehand
how unspeakably wretched I should be. But these renewed
and larger offers tempt me. I can force myself
to go aboard a ship, and I can force myself to do at
that reading-desk what I have done a hundred times;
but whether, with all this unsettled fluctuating distress
in my mind, I could force an original book out of
it, is another question." On the 22nd, still striving
hard to find reasons to cope with the all but irresistible
arguments against any such adventure, which indeed,
with everything that then surrounded him, would have
been little short of madness, he thus stated his experience
of his two circuits of public reading. "Remember
that at home here the thing has never missed fire,
but invariably does more the second time than it did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_272" id="Page_3_272">[272]</a></span>
the first; and also that I have got so used to it, and
have worked so hard at it, as to get out of it more than
I ever thought was in it for that purpose. I think all
the probabilities for such a country as Australia are
immense." The terrible difficulty was that the home
argument struck both ways. "If I were to go it would
be a penance and a misery, and I dread the thought
more than I can possibly express. The domestic life
of the Readings is all but intolerable to me when I am
away for a few weeks at a time merely, and what would
it be&mdash;&mdash;." On the other hand it was also a thought
of home, far beyond the mere personal loss or gain of
it, that made him willing still to risk even so much
misery and penance; and he had a fancy that it might
be possible to take his eldest daughter with him. "It
is useless and needless for me to say what the conflict
in my own mind is. How painfully unwilling I am to
go, and yet how painfully sensible that perhaps I ought
to go&mdash;with all the hands upon my skirts that I cannot
fail to feel and see there, whenever I look round. It
is a struggle of no common sort, as you will suppose,
you who know the circumstances of the struggler." It
closed at once when he clearly saw that to take any of
his family with him, and make satisfactory arrangement
for the rest during such an absence, would be impossible.
By this time also he began to find his way
to the new story, and better hopes and spirits had returned.</p>

<p>In January 1863 he had taken his daughter and his
sister-in-law to Paris, and he read twice at the Embassy
in behalf of the British Charitable Fund, the
success being such that he consented to read twice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_273" id="Page_3_273">[273]</a></span>
again.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> He passed his birthday of that year (the 7th
of the following month) at Arras. "You will remember
me to-day, I know. Thanks for it. An odd
birthday, but I am as little out of heart as you would
have me be&mdash;floored now and then, but coming up
again at the call of Time. I wanted to see this town,
birthplace of our amiable Sea Green" (Robespierre);
"and I find a Grande Place so very remarkable and
picturesque that it is astonishing how people miss it.
Here too I found, in a bye-country place just near, a
Fair going on, with a Religious Richardson's in it&mdash;<span class="smcap">Th&eacute;atre
Religieux</span>&mdash;'donnant six fois par jour,
l'histoire de la Croix en tableaux vivants, depuis la
naissance de notre Seigneur jusqu'&agrave; son sepulture.
Aussi l'immolation d'Isaac, par son p&egrave;re Abraham.'
It was just before nightfall when I came upon it;
and one of the three wise men was up to his eyes in
lamp oil, hanging the moderators. A woman in blue
and fleshings (whether an angel or Joseph's wife I
don't know) was addressing the crowd through an
enormous speaking-trumpet; and a very small boy with
a property lamb (I leave you to judge who <i>he</i> was) was
standing on his head on a barrel-organ." Returning
to England by Boulogne in the same year, as he stepped
into the Folkestone boat he encountered a friend, Mr.
Charles Manby (for, in recording a trait of character
so pleasing and honourable, it is not necessary that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_274" id="Page_3_274">[274]</a></span>
should suppress the name), also passing over to England.
"Taking leave of Manby was a shabby man of
whom I had some remembrance, but whom I could
not get into his place in my mind. Noticing when we
stood out of the harbour that he was on the brink of
the pier, waving his hat in a desolate manner, I said to
Manby, 'Surely I know that man.'&mdash;'I should think
you did,' said he: 'Hudson!' He is living&mdash;just
living&mdash;at Paris, and Manby had brought him on. He
said to Manby at parting, 'I shall not have a good
dinner again, till you come back.' I asked Manby
why he stuck to him? He said, Because he (Hudson)
had so many people in his power, and had held his
peace; and because he (Manby) saw so many Notabilities
grand with him now, who were always grovelling
for 'shares' in the days of his grandeur."</p>

<p>Upon Dickens's arrival in London the second series
of his readings was brought to a close; and opportunity
may be taken, before describing the third, to
speak of the manuscript volume found among his
papers, containing Memoranda for use in his writings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickens</span> began the Book of Memoranda for possible
use in his work, to which occasional reference has been
made, in January 1855, six months before the first page
of <i>Little Dorrit</i> was written; and I find no allusion
leading me to suppose, except in one very doubtful instance,
that he had made addition to its entries, or been
in the habit of resorting to them, after the date of <i>Our
Mutual Friend</i>. It seems to comprise that interval of
ten years in his life.</p>

<p>In it were put down any hints or suggestions that
occurred to him. A mere piece of imagery or fancy,
it might be at one time; at another the outline of a
subject or a character; then a bit of description or
dialogue; no order or sequence being observed in any.
Titles for stories were set down too, and groups of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_276" id="Page_3_276">[276]</a></span>
names for the actors in them; not the least curious of
the memoranda belonging to this class. More rarely,
entry is made of some oddity of speech; and he has
thus preserved in it, <i>verbatim et literatim</i>, what he declared
to have been as startling a message as he ever
received. A confidential servant at Tavistock House,
having conferred on some proposed changes in his bed-room
with the party that was to do the work, delivered
this ultimatum to her master. "The gas-fitter says, sir,
that he can't alter the fitting of your gas in your bed-room
without taking up almost the ole of your bed-room
floor, and pulling your room to pieces. He says, of
course you can have it done if you wish, and he'll do
it for you and make a good job of it, but he would have
to destroy your room first, and go entirely under the
jistes."<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>It is very interesting in this book, last legacy as it is
of the literary remains of such a writer, to compare the
way in which fancies were worked out with their beginnings
entered in its pages. Those therefore will first be
taken that in some form or other appeared afterwards
in his writings, with such reference to the latter as may
enable the reader to make comparison for himself.</p>

<p>"Our House. Whatever it is, it is in a first-rate
situation, and a fashionable neighbourhood. (Auctioneer
called it 'a gentlemanly residence.') A series
of little closets squeezed up into the corner of a dark
street&mdash;but a Duke's Mansion round the corner. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_277" id="Page_3_277">[277]</a></span>
whole house just large enough to hold a vile smell.
The air breathed in it, at the best of times, a kind of
Distillation of Mews." He made it the home of the
Barnacles in <i>Little Dorrit</i>.</p>

<p>What originally he meant to express by Mrs. Clennam
in the same story has narrower limits, and a character
less repellent, in the Memoranda than it assumed
in the book. "Bed-ridden (or room-ridden) twenty&mdash;five-and-twenty&mdash;years;
any length of time. As to
most things, kept at a standstill all the while. Thinking
of altered streets as the old streets&mdash;changed things
as the unchanged things&mdash;the youth or girl I quarrelled
with all those years ago, as the same youth or
girl now. Brought out of doors by an unexpected
exercise of my latent strength of character, and then
how strange!"</p>

<p>One of the people of the same story who becomes a
prominent actor in it, Henry Gowan, a creation on
which he prided himself as forcible and new, seems to
have risen to his mind in this way. "I affect to believe
that I would do anything myself for a ten-pound
note, and that anybody else would. I affect to be
always book-keeping in every man's case, and posting
up a little account of good and evil with every one.
Thus the greatest rascal becomes 'the dearest old fellow,'
and there is much less difference than you would
be inclined to suppose between an honest man and a
scoundrel. While I affect to be finding good in most
men, I am in reality decrying it where it really is, and
setting it up where it is not. Might not a presentation
of this far from uncommon class of character, if I
could put it strongly enough, be likely to lead some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_278" id="Page_3_278">[278]</a></span>
men to reflect, and change a little? I think it has never
been done."</p>

<p>In <i>Little Dorrit</i> also will be found a picture which
seems to live with a more touching effect in his first
pleasing fancy of it. "The ferryman on a peaceful
river, who has been there from youth, who lives, who
grows old, who does well, who does ill, who changes,
who dies&mdash;the river runs six hours up and six hours
down, the current sets off that point, the same allowance
must be made for the drifting of the boat, the
same tune is always played by the rippling water against
the prow."</p>

<p>Here was an entry made when the thought occurred
to him of the close of old Dorrit's life. "First sign
of the father failing and breaking down. Cancels long
interval. Begins to talk about the turnkey who first
called him the Father of the Marshalsea&mdash;as if he were
still living. 'Tell Bob I want to speak to him. See
if he is on the Lock, my dear.'" And here was the
first notion of Clennam's reverse of fortune. "His
falling into difficulty, and himself imprisoned in the
Marshalsea. Then she, out of all her wealth and
changed station, comes back in her old dress, and
devotes herself in the old way."</p>

<p>He seems to have designed, for the sketches of
society in the same tale, a "Full-length portrait of his
lordship, surrounded by worshippers;" of which, beside
that brief memorandum, only his first draft of the
general outline was worked at. "Sensible men enough,
agreeable men enough, independent men enough in a
certain way;&mdash;but the moment they begin to circle
round my lord, and to shine with a borrowed light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_279" id="Page_3_279">[279]</a></span>
from his lordship, heaven and earth how mean and
subservient! What a competition and outbidding of
each other in servility."</p>

<p>The last of the Memoranda hints which were used in
the story whose difficulties at its opening seem first to
have suggested them, ran thus: "The unwieldy ship
taken in tow by the snorting little steam tug"&mdash;by which
was prefigured the patriarch Casby and his agent Panks.</p>

<p>In a few lines are the germ of the tale called <i>Hunted
Down:</i> "Devoted to the Destruction of a man. Revenge
built up on love. The secretary in the Wainewright
case, who had fallen in love (or supposed he
had) with the murdered girl."&mdash;The hint on which he
worked in his description of the villain of that story,
is also in the Memoranda. "The man with his hair
parted straight up the front of his head, like an aggravating
gravel-walk. Always presenting it to you. 'Up
here, if you please. Neither to the right nor left.
Take me exactly in this direction. Straight up here.
Come off the grass&mdash;'"</p>

<p>His first intention as to the <i>Tale of Two Cities</i> was
to write it upon a plan proposed in this manuscript
book. "How as to a story in two periods&mdash;with a
lapse of time between, like a French Drama? Titles
for such a notion. <span class="smcap">Time! The Leaves of the Forest.
Scattered Leaves. The Great Wheel. Round
and Round. Old Leaves. Long Ago. Far Apart.
Fallen Leaves. Five and Twenty Years. Years
and Years. Rolling Years. Day after Day.
Felled Trees. Memory Carton. Rolling Stones.
Two Generations.</span>" That special title of <i>Memory
Carton</i> shows that what led to the greatest success of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_280" id="Page_3_280">[280]</a></span>
the book as written was always in his mind; and
another of the memoranda is this rough hint of the
character itself. "The drunken?&mdash;dissipated?&mdash;What?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lion</span>&mdash;and
his <span class="smcap">Jackall</span> and Primer, stealing down
to him at unwonted hours."</p>

<p>The studies of Silas Wegg and his patron as they
exist in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, are hardly such good
comedy as in the form which the first notion of them
seems to have intended. "Gibbon's Decline and
Fall. The two characters. One reporting to the other
as he reads. Both getting confused as to whether it is
not all going on now." In the same story may be
traced, more or less clearly, other fancies which had
found their first expression in the Memoranda. A
touch for Bella Wilfer is here. "Buying poor shabby&mdash;<span class="smcap">father</span>?&mdash;a
new hat. So incongruous that it makes
him like African King Boy, or King George; who is
usually full dressed when he has nothing upon him but
a cocked hat or a waistcoat." Here undoubtedly is
the voice of Podsnap. "I stand by my friends and
acquaintances;&mdash;not for their sakes, but because they
are <i>my</i> friends and acquaintances. <i>I</i> know them, <i>I</i>
have licensed them, they have taken out <i>my</i> certificate.
Ergo, I champion them as myself." To the same redoubtable
person another trait clearly belongs. "And
by denying a thing, supposes that he altogether puts
it out of existence." A third very perfectly expresses
the boy, ready for mischief, who does all the work
there is to be done in Eugene Wrayburn's place of
business. "The office boy for ever looking out of
window, who never has anything to do."</p>

<p>The poor wayward purposeless good-hearted master<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_281" id="Page_3_281">[281]</a></span>
of the boy, Eugene himself, is as evidently in this:
"If they were great things, I, the untrustworthy man
in little things, would do them earnestly&mdash;But O No,
I wouldn't!" What follows has a more direct reference; being
indeed almost literally copied in the story.
"As to the question whether I, Eugene, lying ill and
sick even unto death, may be consoled by the representation
that coming through this illness, I shall begin
a new life, and have energy and purpose and all I have
yet wanted: 'I <i>hope</i> I should, but I <i>know</i> I shouldn't.
Let me die, my dear.'"</p>

<p>In connection with the same book, the last in that
form which he lived to complete, another fancy may
be copied from which, though not otherwise worked
out in the tale, the relation of Lizzie Hexam to
her brother was taken. "A man, and his wife&mdash;or
daughter&mdash;or niece. The man, a reprobate and ruffian;
the woman (or girl) with good in her, and with compunctions.
He believes nothing, and defies everything; yet
has suspicions always, that she is 'praying
against' his evil schemes, and making them go wrong.
He is very much opposed to this, and is always angrily
harping on it. 'If she <i>must</i> pray, why can't she pray
in their favour, instead of going against 'em? She's
always ruining me&mdash;she always is&mdash;and calls that, Duty!
There's a religious person! Calls it Duty to fly in my
face! Calls it Duty to go sneaking against me!'"</p>

<p>Other fancies preserved in his Memoranda were left
wholly unemployed, receiving from him no more permanent
form of any kind than that which they have
in this touching record; and what most people would
probably think the most attractive and original of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_282" id="Page_3_282">[282]</a></span>
the thoughts he had thus set down for future use, are
those that were never used.</p>

<p>Here were his first rough notes for the opening of a
story. "Beginning with the breaking up of a large
party of guests at a country house: house left lonely
with the shrunken family in it: guests spoken of, and
introduced to the reader that way.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Or</span>, beginning with
a house abandoned by a family fallen into reduced circumstances.
Their old furniture there, and numberless
tokens of their old comforts. Inscriptions under the
bells downstairs&mdash;'Mr. John's Room,' 'Miss Caroline's
Room.' Great gardens trimly kept to attract a tenant:
but no one in them. A landscape without figures.
Billiard room: table covered up, like a body. Great
stables without horses, and great coach-houses without
carriages. Grass growing in the chinks of the stone-paving,
this bright cold winter day. <i>Downhills.</i>"
Another opening had also suggested itself to him.
"Open a story by bringing two strongly contrasted
places and strongly contrasted sets of people, into the
connexion necessary for the story, by means of an electric
message. Describe the message&mdash;<i>be</i> the message&mdash;flashing
along through space, over the earth, and
under the sea."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Connected with which in some way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_283" id="Page_3_283">[283]</a></span>
would seem to be this other notion, following it in the
Memoranda. "Representing London&mdash;or Paris, or any
other great place&mdash;in the new light of being actually
unknown to all the people in the story, and only taking
the colour of their fears and fancies and opinions. So
getting a new aspect, and being unlike itself. An <i>odd</i>
unlikeness of itself."</p>

<p>The subjects for stories are various, and some are
striking. There was one he clung to much, and
thought of frequently as in a special degree available
for a series of papers in his periodical; but when he
came to close quarters with it the difficulties were found
to be too great. "English landscape. The beautiful
prospect, trim fields, clipped hedges, everything so
neat and orderly&mdash;gardens, houses, roads. Where are
the people who do all this? There must be a great
many of them, to do it. Where are they all? And
are <i>they</i>, too, so well kept and so fair to see? Suppose
the foregoing to be wrought out by an Englishman:
say, from China: who knows nothing about his native
country." To which may be added a fancy that
savours of the same mood of discontent, political and
social. "How do I know that I, a man, am to learn
from insects&mdash;unless it is to learn how little my littlenesses
are? All that botheration in the hive about
the queen bee, may be, in little, me and the court circular."</p>

<p>A domestic story he had met with in the State Trials
struck him greatly by its capabilities, and I may preface
it by mentioning another subject, not entered in the
Memoranda, which for a long time impressed him as
capable of attractive treatment. It was after reading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_284" id="Page_3_284">[284]</a></span>
one of the witch-trials that this occurred to him; and
the heroine was to be a girl who for a special purpose
had taken a witch's disguise, and whose trick was not
discovered until she was actually at the stake. Here
is the State Trials story as told by Dickens. "There
is a case in the State Trials, where a certain officer
made love to a (supposed) miser's daughter, and ultimately
induced her to give her father slow poison,
while nursing him in sickness. Her father discovered
it, told her so, forgave her, and said 'Be patient my
dear&mdash;I shall not live long, even if I recover: and then
you shall have all my wealth.' Though penitent then,
she afterwards poisoned him again (under the same
influence), and successfully. Whereupon it appeared
that the old man had no money at all, and had lived
on a small annuity which died with him, though always
feigning to be rich. He had loved this daughter with
great affection."</p>

<p>A theme touching closely on ground that some might
think dangerous, is sketched in the following fancy.
"The father (married young) who, in perfect innocence,
venerates his son's young wife, as the realization
of his ideal of woman. (He not happy in his own
choice.) The son slights her, and knows nothing of
her worth. The father watches her, protects her,
labours for her, endures for her,&mdash;is for ever divided
between his strong natural affection for his son as his
son, and his resentment against him as this young
creature's husband." Here is another, less dangerous,
which he took from an actual occurrence made known
to him when he was at Bonchurch. "The idea of my
being brought up by my mother (me the narrator), my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_285" id="Page_3_285">[285]</a></span>
father being dead; and growing up in this belief until
I find that my father is the gentleman I have sometimes
seen, and oftener heard of, who has the handsome
young wife, and the dog I once took notice of
when I was a little child, and who lives in the great
house and drives about."</p>

<p>Very admirable is this. "The girl separating herself
from the lover who has shewn himself unworthy&mdash;loving
him still&mdash;living single for his sake&mdash;but never
more renewing their old relations. Coming to him
when they are both grown old, and nursing him in his
last illness." Nor is the following less so. "Two girls
<i>mis-marrying</i> two men. The man who has evil in him,
dragging the superior woman down. The man who has
good in him, raising the inferior woman up." Dickens
would have been at his best in working out both fancies.</p>

<p>In some of the most amusing of his sketches of character,
women also take the lead. "The lady un peu
pass&eacute;e, who is determined to be interesting. No matter
how much I love that person&mdash;nay, the more so for
that very reason&mdash;I <span class="smcap">must</span> flatter, and bother, and be
weak and apprehensive and nervous, and what not. If
I were well and strong, agreeable and self-denying, my
friend might forget me." Another not remotely belonging
to the same family is as neatly hit off. "The
sentimental woman feels that the comic, undesigning,
unconscious man, is 'Her Fate.'&mdash;I her fate? God
bless my soul, it puts me into a cold perspiration to
think of it. <i>I</i> her fate? How can <i>I</i> be her fate? I
don't mean to be. I don't want to have anything to
do with her&mdash;Sentimental woman perceives nevertheless
that Destiny must be accomplished."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_286" id="Page_3_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>Other portions of a female group are as humorously
sketched and hardly less entertaining. "The enthusiastically
complimentary person, who forgets you in
her own flowery prosiness: as&mdash;'I have no need to say
to a person of your genius and feeling, and wide range
of experience'&mdash;and then, being shortsighted, puts up
her glass to remember who you are."&mdash;"Two sisters"
(these were real people known to him). "One going
in for being generally beloved (which she is not by any
means); and the other for being generally hated
(which she needn't be)."&mdash;"The bequeathed maid-servant,
or friend. Left as a legacy. And a devil of
a legacy too."&mdash;"The woman who is never on any
account to hear of anything shocking. For whom the
world is to be of barley-sugar."&mdash;"The lady who lives
on her enthusiasm; and hasn't a jot."&mdash;"Bright-eyed
creature selling jewels. The stones and the eyes."
Much significance is in the last few words. One may
see to what uses Dickens would have turned them.</p>

<p>A more troubled note is sounded in another of these
female characters. "I am a common woman&mdash;fallen.
Is it devilry in me&mdash;is it a wicked comfort&mdash;what is it&mdash;that
induces me to be always tempting other women
down, while I hate myself!" This next, with as much
truth in it, goes deeper than the last. "The prostitute
who will not let one certain youth approach her. 'O
let there be some one in the world, who having an inclination
towards me has not gratified it, and has not
known me in my degradation!' She almost loving
him.&mdash;Suppose, too, this touch in her could not be
believed in by his mother or mistress: by some handsome
and proudly virtuous woman, always revolting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_287" id="Page_3_287">[287]</a></span>
from her." A more agreeable sketch than either follows,
though it would not please M. Taine so well.
"The little baby-like married woman&mdash;so strange in
her new dignity, and talking with tears in her eyes, of
her sisters 'and all of them' at home. Never from
home before, and never going back again." Another
from the same manuscript volume not less attractive,
which was sketched in his own home, I gave upon a
former page.</p>

<p>The female character in its relations with the opposite
sex has lively illustration in the Memoranda.
"The man who is governed by his wife, and is heartily
despised in consequence by all other wives; who still
want to govern <i>their</i> husbands, notwithstanding." An
alarming family pair follows that. "The playful&mdash;and
scratching&mdash;family. Father and daughter." And here
is another. "The agreeable (and wicked) young-mature
man, and his devoted sister." What next was
set down he had himself partly seen; and, by enquiry
at the hospital named, had ascertained the truth of the
rest. "The two people in the Incurable Hospital.&mdash;The
poor incurable girl lying on a water-bed, and the
incurable man who has a strange flirtation with her;
comes and makes confidences to her; snips and arranges
her plants; and rehearses to her the comic
songs(!) by writing which he materially helps out his
living."<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_288" id="Page_3_288">[288]</a></span></p>
<p>Two lighter figures are very pleasantly touched.
"Set of circumstances which suddenly bring an easy,
airy fellow into near relations with people he knows
nothing about, and has never even seen. This, through
his being thrown in the way of the innocent young
personage of the story. 'Then there is Uncle Sam to
be considered,' says she. 'Aye to be sure,' says he,
'so there is! By Jupiter, I forgot Uncle Sam. He's
a rock ahead, is Uncle Sam. He must be considered,
of course; he must be smoothed down; he must be
cleared out of the way. To be sure. I never thought
of Uncle Sam.&mdash;By the bye, who <i>is</i> Uncle Sam?'"</p>

<p>There are several such sketches as that, to set against
the groups of women; and some have Dickens's favourite
vein of satire in them. "The man whose vista is
always stopped up by the image of Himself. Looks
down a long walk, and can't see round himself, or over
himself, or beyond himself. Is always blocking up his
own way. Would be such a good thing for him, if he
could knock himself down." Another picture of selfishness
is touched with greater delicacy. "'Too good'
to be grateful to, or dutiful to, or anything else that
ought to be. 'I won't thank you: you are too good.'&mdash;'Don't
ask me to marry you: you are too good.'&mdash;In
short, I don't particularly mind ill-using you, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_289" id="Page_3_289">[289]</a></span>
being selfish with you: for you are <i>so</i> good. Virtue its
own reward!" A third, which seems to reverse the
dial, is but another face of it: frankly avowing faults,
which are virtues. "In effect&mdash;I admit I am generous,
amiable, gentle, magnanimous. Reproach me&mdash;I deserve
it&mdash;I know my faults&mdash;I have striven in vain to
get the better of them." Dickens would have made
much, too, of the working out of the next. "The
knowing man in distress, who borrows a round sum of
a generous friend. Comes, in depression and tears,
dines, gets the money, and gradually cheers up over his
wine, as he obviously entertains himself with the reflection
that his friend is an egregious fool to have lent it
to him, and that <i>he</i> would have known better." And
so of this other. "The man who invariably says apposite
things (in the way of reproof or sarcasm) <span class="smcap">that
he don't mean.</span> Astonished when they are explained
to him."</p>

<p>Here is a fancy that I remember him to have been
more than once bent upon making use of: but the
opportunity never came. "The two men to be guarded
against, as to their revenge. One, whom I openly hold
in some serious animosity, whom I am at the pains to
wound and defy, and whom I estimate as worth wounding
and defying;&mdash;the other, whom I treat as a sort of
insect, and contemptuously and pleasantly flick aside
with my glove. But, it turns out to be the latter who
is the really dangerous man; and, when I expect the
blow from the other, it comes from <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>We have the master hand in the following bit of
dialogue, which takes wider application than that for
which it appears to have been intended.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_290" id="Page_3_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"'There is some virtue in him too.'</p>

<p>"'Virtue! Yes. So there is in any grain of seed in
a seedsman's shop&mdash;but you must put it in the ground,
before you can get any good out of it.'</p>

<p>"'Do you mean that <i>he</i> must be put in the ground
before any good comes of <i>him?</i>'</p>

<p>"'Indeed I do. You may call it burying him, or
you may call it sowing him, as you like. You must set
him in the earth, before you get any good of him.'"</p>

<p>One of the entries is a list of persons and places
meant to have been made subjects for special description,
and it will awaken regret that only as to one
of them (the Mugby Refreshments) his intention was
fulfilled. "A Vestryman. A Briber. A Station Waiting-Room.
Refreshments at Mugby. A Physician's
Waiting-Room. The Royal Academy. An Antiquary's
house. A Sale Room. A Picture Gallery
(for sale). A Waste-paper Shop. A Post-Office. A
Theatre."</p>

<p>Two more entries are the last which he made.
"<span class="smcap">Available names</span>" introduces a wonderful list in
the exact following classes and order; as to which the
reader may be left to his own memory for selection of
such as found their way into the several stories from
<i>Little Dorrit</i> to the end. The rest, not lifted into that
higher notice by such favour of their creator, must remain
like any other undistinguished crowd. But among
them may perhaps be detected, by those who have
special insight for the physiognomy of a name, some
few with so great promise in them of fun and character
as will make the "mute inglorious" fate which has befallen
them a subject for special regret; and much
ingenious speculation will probably wait upon all.
Dickens has generally been thought, by the curious,
to display not a few of his most characteristic traits in

this must be left to conjecture; but "Brobity" is the
name of one of the people in his unfinished story, and
the suggestion may have been meant for some incident
in it. If so, it is the only passage in the volume which
can be in any way connected with the piece of writing
on which he was last engaged. Some names were taken

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sudden death of Thackeray on the Christmas
eve of 1863 was a painful shock to Dickens. It would
not become me to speak, when he has himself spoken,
of his relations with so great a writer and so old a
friend.</p>

<p>"I saw him first, nearly twenty-eight years ago,
when he proposed to become the illustrator of my earliest
book. I saw him last,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> shortly before Christmas, at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_299" id="Page_3_299">[299]</a></span>
Athen&aelig;um Club, when he told me that he had been in
bed three days .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that he had it in his mind to
try a new remedy which he laughingly described. He
was cheerful, and looked very bright. In the night of
that day week, he died. The long interval between
these two periods is marked in my remembrance of him
by many occasions when he was extremely humorous,
when he was irresistibly extravagant, when he was softened
and serious, when he was charming with children.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
No one can be surer than I, of the greatness and
goodness of his heart.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In no place should I take it upon
myself at this time to discourse of his books, of his refined
knowledge of character, of his subtle acquaintance
with the weaknesses of human nature, of his delightful
playfulness as an essayist, of his quaint and touching
ballads, of his mastery over the English language.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But before me lies all that he had written of his latest
story .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the pain I have felt in perusing it has
not been deeper than the conviction that he was in the
healthiest vigour of his powers when he worked on this
last labour.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The last words he corrected in print
were 'And my heart throbbed with an exquisite bliss.'
God grant that on that Christmas Eve when he laid his
head back on his pillow and threw up his arms as he
had been wont to do when very weary, some consciousness
of duty done, and of Christian hope throughout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_300" id="Page_3_300">[300]</a></span>
life humbly cherished, may have caused his own heart
so to throb, when he passed away to his Redeemer's
rest. He was found peacefully lying as above described,
composed, undisturbed, and to all appearance asleep."</p>

<p>Other griefs were with Dickens at this time, and close
upon them came the too certain evidence that his own
health was yielding to the overstrain which had been
placed upon it by the occurrences and anxieties of the
few preceding years. His mother, whose infirm health
had been tending for more than two years to the close,
died in September 1863; and on his own birthday in
the following February he had tidings of the death of
his second son Walter, on the last day of the old year
in the officers' hospital at Calcutta; to which he had
been sent up invalided from his station, on his way
home. He was a lieutenant in the 26th Native Infantry
regiment, and had been doing duty with the
42nd Highlanders. In 1853 his father had thus written
to the youth's godfather, Walter Savage Landor:
"Walter is a very good boy, and comes home from
school with honorable commendation and a prize into
the bargain. He never gets into trouble, for he is a
great favourite with the whole house and one of the
most amiable boys in the boy-world. He comes out
on birthdays in a blaze of shirt pin." The pin was a
present from Landor; to whom three years later, when
the boy had obtained his cadetship through the kindness
of Miss Coutts, Dickens wrote again. "Walter
has done extremely well at school; has brought home
a prize in triumph; and will be eligible to 'go up' for
his India examination soon after next Easter. Having
a direct appointment he will probably be sent out soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_301" id="Page_3_301">[301]</a></span>
after he has passed, and so will fall into that strange
life 'up the country' before he well knows he is alive,
or what life is&mdash;which indeed seems to be rather an advanced
state of knowledge." If he had lived another
month he would have reached his twenty-third year,
and perhaps not then the advanced state of knowledge
his father speaks of. But, never forfeiting his claim to
those kindly paternal words, he had the goodness and
simplicity of boyhood to the last.</p>

<p>Dickens had at this time begun his last story in twenty
numbers, and my next chapter will show through what
unwonted troubles, in this and the following year, he
had to fight his way. What otherwise during its progress
chiefly interested him, was the enterprise of Mr.
Fechter at the Lyceum, of which he had become the
lessee; and Dickens was moved to this quite as much
by generous sympathy with the difficulties of such a
position to an artist who was not an Englishman, as by
genuine admiration of Mr. Fechter's acting. He became
his helper in disputes, adviser on literary points,
referee in matters of management; and for some years
no face was more familiar than the French comedian's
at Gadshill or in the office of his journal. But theatres
and their affairs are things of a season, and even Dickens's
whim and humour will not revive for us any
interest in these. No bad example, however, of the
difficulties in which a French actor may find himself
with English playwrights, will appear in a few amusing
words from one of his letters about a piece played at
the Princess's before the Lyceum management was
taken in hand.</p>

<p>"I have been cautioning Fechter about the play<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_302" id="Page_3_302">[302]</a></span>
whereof he gave the plot and scenes to B; and out of
which I have struck some enormities, my account of
which will (I think) amuse you. It has one of the best
first acts I ever saw; but if he can do much with the
last two, not to say three, there are resources in his art
that <i>I</i> know nothing about. When I went over the
play this day week, he was at least 20 minutes, <i>in a
boat, in the last scene</i>, discussing with another gentleman
(also in the boat) whether he should kill him or
not; after which the gentleman dived overboard and
swam for it. Also, in the most important and dangerous
parts of the play, there was a young person of the
name of Pickles who was constantly being mentioned
by name, in conjunction with the powers of light or
darkness; as, 'Great Heaven! Pickles?'&mdash;'By Hell,
'tis Pickles!'&mdash;'Pickles? a thousand Devils!'&mdash;'Distraction!
Pickles?'"<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_303" id="Page_3_303">[303]</a></span></p>
<p>The old year ended and the new one opened sadly
enough. The death of Leech in November affected
Dickens very much,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> and a severe attack of illness in
February put a broad mark between his past life and
what remained to him of the future. The lameness
now began in his left foot which never afterwards
wholly left him, which was attended by great suffering,
and which baffled experienced physicians. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_304" id="Page_3_304">[304]</a></span>
persisted in his ordinary exercise during heavy snow-storms,
and to the last he had the fancy that his illness
was merely local. But that this was an error is now
certain; and it is more than probable that if the
nervous danger and disturbance it implied had been
correctly appreciated at the time, its warning might
have been of priceless value to Dickens. Unhappily
he never thought of husbanding his strength except
for the purpose of making fresh demands upon it, and
it was for this he took a brief holiday in France during
the summer. "Before I went away," he wrote to
his daughter, "I had certainly worked myself into a
damaged state. But the moment I got away, I began,
thank God, to get well. I hope to profit by this experience,
and to make future dashes from my desk before
I want them." At his return he was in the terrible
railway accident at Staplehurst, on a day<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> which proved
afterwards more fatal to him; and it was with shaken
nerves but unsubdued energy he resumed the labour to
be presently described. His foot troubled him more
or less throughout the autumn;<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> he was beset by nervous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_305" id="Page_3_305">[305]</a></span>
apprehensions which the accident had caused to
himself, not lessened by his generous anxiety to assuage
the severer sufferings inflicted by it on others;<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> and
that he should nevertheless have determined, on the
close of his book, to undertake a series of readings
involving greater strain and fatigue than any hitherto,
was a startling circumstance. He had perhaps become
conscious, without owning it even to himself, that for
exertion of this kind the time left him was short; but,
whatever pressed him on, his task of the next three
years, self-imposed, was to make the most money in
the shortest time without any regard to the physical
labour to be undergone. The very letter announcing
his new engagement shows how entirely unfit he was to
enter upon it.</p>

<p>"For some time," he wrote at the end of February
1866, "I have been very unwell. F. B. wrote me
word that with such a pulse as I described, an examination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_306" id="Page_3_306">[306]</a></span>
of the heart was absolutely necessary. 'Want
of muscular power in the heart,' B said. 'Only
remarkable irritability of the heart,' said Doctor
Brinton of Brook-street, who had been called in to
consultation. I was not disconcerted; for I knew
well beforehand that the effect could not possibly be
without the one cause at the bottom of it, of some
degeneration of some function of the heart. Of course
I am not so foolish as to suppose that all my work can
have been achieved without <i>some</i> penalty, and I have
noticed for some time a decided change in my buoyancy
and hopefulness&mdash;in other words, in my usual
'tone.' But tonics have already brought me round.
So I have accepted an offer, from Chappells of Bond-street,
of &pound;50 a night for thirty nights to read 'in
England, Ireland, Scotland, or Paris;' they undertaking
all the business, paying all personal expenses,
travelling and otherwise, of myself, John" (his office
servant), "and my gasman; and making what they
can of it. I begin, I believe, in Liverpool on the
Thursday in Easter week, and then come to London.
I am going to read at Cheltenham (on my own
account) on the 23rd and 24th of this month, staying
with Macready of course."</p>

<p>The arrangement of this series of Readings differed
from those of its predecessors in relieving Dickens
from every anxiety except of the reading itself; but,
by such rapid and repeated change of nights at distant
places as kept him almost wholly in a railway carriage
when not at the reading-desk or in bed, it added
enormously to the physical fatigue. He would read
at St. James's Hall in London one night, and at Bradford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_307" id="Page_3_307">[307]</a></span>
the next. He would read in Edinburgh, go on
to Glasgow and to Aberdeen, then come back to
Glasgow, read again in Edinburgh, strike off to Manchester,
come back to St. James's Hall once more, and
begin the same round again. It was labour that must
in time have broken down the strongest man, and
what Dickens was when he assumed it we have seen.</p>

<p>He did not himself admit a shadow of misgiving.
"As to the readings" (11th of March), "all I have to
do is, to take in my book and read, at the appointed
place and hour, and come out again. All the business
of every kind, is done by Chappells. They take John
and my other man, merely for my convenience. I
have no more to do with any detail whatever, than you
have. They transact all the business at their own cost,
and on their own responsibility. I think they are disposed
to do it in a very good spirit, because, whereas
the original proposition was for thirty readings 'in
England, Ireland, Scotland, or Paris,' they wrote out
their agreement 'in London, the Provinces, or elsewhere,
<i>as you and we may agree</i>.' For this they pay
&pound;1500 in three sums; &pound;500 on beginning, &pound;500 on the
fifteenth Reading, &pound;500 at the close. Every charge of
every kind, they pay besides. I rely for mere curiosity
on <i>Doctor Marigold</i> (I am going to begin with
him in Liverpool, and at St. James's Hall). I have
got him up with immense pains, and should like to
give you a notion what I am going to do with him."</p>

<p>The success everywhere went far beyond even the
former successes. A single night at Manchester, when
eight hundred stalls were let, two thousand five hundred
and sixty-five people admitted, and the receipts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_308" id="Page_3_308">[308]</a></span>
amounted to more than three hundred pounds, was
followed in nearly the same proportion by all the
greater towns; and on the 20th of April the outlay
for the entire venture was paid, leaving all that remained,
to the middle of the month of June, sheer
profit. "I came back last Sunday," he wrote on the
30th of May, "with my last country piece of work for
this time done. Everywhere the success has been the
same. St. James's Hall last night was quite a splendid
spectacle. Two more Tuesdays there, and I shall retire
into private life. I have only been able to get to
Gadshill once since I left it, and that was the day
before yesterday."</p>

<p>One memorable evening he had passed at my house
in the interval, when he saw Mrs. Carlyle for the last
time. Her sudden death followed shortly after, and
near the close of April he had thus written to me from
Liverpool. "It was a terrible shock to me, and poor
dear Carlyle has been in my mind ever since. How
often I have thought of the unfinished novel. No one
now to finish it. None of the writing women come
near her at all." This was an allusion to what had
passed at their meeting. It was on the second of April,
the day when Mr. Carlyle had delivered his inaugural
address as Lord Rector of Edinburgh University, and
a couple of ardent words from Professor Tyndall had
told her of the triumph just before dinner. She came
to us flourishing the telegram in her hand, and the
radiance of her enjoyment of it was upon her all
the night. Among other things she gave Dickens the
subject for a novel, from what she had herself observed
at the outside of a house in her street; of which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_309" id="Page_3_309">[309]</a></span>
various incidents were drawn from the condition of its
blinds and curtains, the costumes visible at its windows,
the cabs at its door, its visitors admitted or rejected, its
articles of furniture delivered or carried away; and the
subtle serious humour of it all, the truth in trifling
bits of character, and the gradual progress into a half-romantic
interest, had enchanted the skilled novelist.
She was well into the second volume of her small
romance before she left, being as far as her observation
then had taken her; but in a few days exciting incidents
were expected, the denouement could not be far
off, and Dickens was to have it when they met again.
Yet it was to something far other than this amusing
little fancy his thoughts had carried him, when he
wrote of no one being capable to finish what she might
have begun. In greater things this was still more true.
No one could doubt it who had come within the fascinating
influence of that sweet and noble nature. With
some of the highest gifts of intellect, and the charm
of a most varied knowledge of books and things, there
was something "beyond, beyond." No one who knew
Mrs. Carlyle could replace her loss when she had passed
away.</p>

<p>The same letter which told of his uninterrupted success
to the last, told me also that he had a heavy cold
upon him and was "very tired and depressed." Some
weeks before the first batch of readings closed, Messrs.
Chappell had already tempted him with an offer for
fifty more nights to begin at Christmas, for which he
meant, as he then said, to ask them seventy pounds a
night. "It would be unreasonable to ask anything
now on the ground of the extent of the late success,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_310" id="Page_3_310">[310]</a></span>
but I am bound to look to myself for the future. The
Chappells are speculators, though of the worthiest and
most honourable kind. They make some bad speculations,
and have made a very good one in this case,
and will set this against those. I told them when we
agreed: 'I offer these thirty Readings to you at fifty
pounds a night, because I know perfectly well beforehand
that no one in your business has the least idea of
their real worth, and I wish to prove it.' The sum
taken is &pound;4720." The result of the fresh negotiation,
though not completed until the beginning of August,
may be at once described. "Chappell instantly accepts
my proposal of forty nights at sixty pounds a
night, and every conceivable and inconceivable expense
paid. To make an even sum, I have made it
forty-two nights for &pound;2500. So I shall now try to
discover a Christmas number" (he means the subject
for one), "and shall, please Heaven, be quit of the
whole series of readings so as to get to work on a new
story for the new series of <i>All the Year Round</i> early in
the spring. The readings begin probably with the
New Year." These were fair designs, but the fairest
are the sport of circumstance, and though the subject
for Christmas was found, the new series of <i>All the
Year</i> Round never had a new story from its founder.
With whatever consequence to himself, the strong tide
of the Readings was to sweep on to its full. The
American war had ceased, and the first renewed offers
from the States had been made and rejected. Hovering
over all, too, were other sterner dispositions. "I
think," he wrote in September, "there is some strange
influence in the atmosphere. Twice last week I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_311" id="Page_3_311">[311]</a></span>
seized in a most distressing manner&mdash;apparently in
the heart; but, I am persuaded, only in the nervous
system."</p>

<p>In the midst of his ovations such checks had not
been wanting. "The police reported officially," he
wrote to his daughter from Liverpool on the 14th of
April, "that three thousand people were turned away
from the hall last night.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Except that I can <i>not</i> sleep,
I really think myself in very much better training than
I had anticipated. A dozen oysters and a little champagne
between the parts every night, seem to constitute
the best restorative I have ever yet tried." "Such a
prodigious demonstration last night at Manchester,"
he wrote to the same correspondent twelve days later,
"that I was obliged (contrary to my principle in such
cases) to go back. I am very tired to-day; for it
would be of itself very hard work in that immense
place, if there were not to be added eighty miles of
railway and late hours to boot." "It has been very
heavy work," he wrote to his sister-in-law on the 11th
of May from Clifton, "getting up at 6.30 each morning
after a heavy night, and I am not at all well to-day.
We had a tremendous hall at Birmingham last night,
&pound;230 odd, 2100 people; and I made a most ridiculous
mistake. Had <i>Nickleby</i> on my list to finish with,
instead of <i>Trial</i>. Read <i>Nickleby</i> with great go, <i>and
the people remained</i>. Went back again at 10 o'clock,
and explained the accident: but said if they liked I
would give them the <i>Trial</i>. They <i>did</i> like;&mdash;and I
had another half hour of it, in that enormous place.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I have so severe a pain in the ball of my left eye
that it makes it hard for me to do anything after 100<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_312" id="Page_3_312">[312]</a></span>
miles shaking since breakfast. My cold is no better,
nor my hand either." It was his left eye, it will be
noted, as it was his left foot and hand; the irritability
or faintness of heart was also of course on the left side;
and it was on the same left side he felt most of the
effect of the railway accident.</p>

<p>Everything was done to make easier the labour of
travel, but nothing could materially abate either the
absolute physical exhaustion, or the nervous strain.
"We arrived here," he wrote from Aberdeen (16th of
May), "safe and sound between 3 and 4 this morning.
There was a compartment for the men, and a charming
room for ourselves furnished with sofas and easy chairs.
We had also a pantry and washing-stand. This carriage
is to go about with us." Two days later he wrote
from Glasgow: "We halted at Perth yesterday, and
got a lovely walk there. Until then I had been in a
condition the reverse of flourishing; half strangled
with my cold, and dyspeptically gloomy and dull; but,
as I feel much more like myself this morning, we are
going to get some fresh air aboard a steamer on the
Clyde." The last letter during his country travel was
from Portsmouth on the 24th of May, and contained
these words: "You need have no fear about America."
The readings closed in June.</p>

<p>The readings of the new year began with even increased
enthusiasm, but not otherwise with happier
omen. Here was his first outline of plan: "I start on
Wednesday afternoon (the 15th of January) for Liverpool,
and then go on to Chester, Derby, Leicester, and
Wolverhampton. On Tuesday the 29th I read in London
again, and in February I read at Manchester and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_313" id="Page_3_313">[313]</a></span>
then go on into Scotland." From Liverpool he wrote
on the 21st: "The enthusiasm has been unbounded.
On Friday night I quite astonished myself; but I was
taken so faint afterwards that they laid me on a sofa, at
the hall for half an hour. I attribute it to my distressing
inability to sleep at night, and to nothing worse.
Everything is made as easy to me as it possibly can be.
Dolby would do anything to lighten the work, and <i>does</i>
everything." The weather was sorely against him.
"At Chester," he wrote on the 24th from Birmingham,
"we read in a snow-storm and a fall of ice. I think it
was the worst weather I ever saw.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. At Wolverhampton
last night the thaw had thoroughly set in, and it
rained furiously, and I was again heavily beaten. We
came on here after the reading (it is only a ride of forty
miles), and it was as much as I could do to hold out
the journey. But I was not faint, as at Liverpool. I
was only exhausted." Five days later he had returned
for his Reading in London, and thus replied to a summons
to dine with Macready at my house: "I am very
tired; cannot sleep; have been severely shaken on an
atrocious railway; read to-night, and have to read at
Leeds on Thursday. But I have settled with Dolby to
put off our going to Leeds on Wednesday, in the hope
of coming to dine with you, and seeing our dear old
friend. I say 'in the hope,' because if I should be a
little more used-up to-morrow than I am to-day, I
should be constrained, in spite of myself, to take to the
sofa and stick there."</p>

<p>On the 15th of February he wrote to his sister-in-law
from Liverpool that they had had "an enormous turnaway"
the previous night. "The day has been very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_314" id="Page_3_314">[314]</a></span>
fine, and I have turned it to the wholesomest account
by walking on the sands at New Brighton all the morning.
I am not quite right within, but believe it to be
an effect of the railway shaking. There is no doubt of
the fact that, after the Staplehurst experience, it tells
more and more (railway shaking, that is) instead of, as
one might have expected, less and less." The last remark
is a strange one, from a man of his sagacity; but
it was part of the too-willing self-deception which he
practised, to justify him in his professed belief that
these continued excesses of labour and excitement were
really doing him no harm. The day after that last letter
he pushed on to Scotland, and on the 17th wrote
to his daughter from Glasgow. The closing night at
Manchester had been enormous. "They cheered to
that extent after it was over that I was obliged to huddle
on my clothes (for I was undressing to prepare for
the journey) and go back again. After so heavy a week,
it <i>was</i> rather stiff to start on this long journey at a
quarter to two in the morning; but I got more sleep
than I ever got in a railway-carriage before.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have,
as I had in the last series of readings, a curious feeling
of soreness all round the body&mdash;which I suppose to
arise from the great exertion of voice .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." Two days
later he wrote to his sister-in-law from the Bridge of
Allan, which he had reached from Glasgow that morning.
"Yesterday I was so unwell with an internal
malady that occasionally at long intervals troubles me
a little, and it was attended with the sudden loss of so
much blood, that I wrote to F. B. from whom I shall
doubtless hear to-morrow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I felt it a little more
exertion to read, afterwards, and I passed a sleepless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_315" id="Page_3_315">[315]</a></span>
night after that again; but otherwise I am in good force
and spirits to-day: I may say, in the best force.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The quiet of this little place is sure to do me good."
He rallied again from this attack, and, though he still
complained of sleeplessness, wrote cheerfully from Glasgow
on the 21st, describing himself indeed as confined
to his room, but only because "in close hiding from a
local poet who has christened his infant son in my
name, and consequently haunts the building." On
getting back to Edinburgh he wrote to me, with intimation
that many troubles had beset him; but that the
pleasure of his audiences, and the providence and forethought
of Messrs. Chappell, had borne him through.
"Everything is done for me with the utmost liberality
and consideration. Every want I can have on these
journeys is anticipated, and not the faintest spark of
the tradesman spirit ever peeps out. I have three men
in constant attendance on me; besides Dolby, who is
an agreeable companion, an excellent manager, and a
good fellow."</p>

<p>On the 4th of March he wrote from Newcastle:
"The readings have made an immense effect in this
place, and it is remarkable that although the people are
individually rough, collectively they are an unusually
tender and sympathetic audience; while their comic
perception is quite up to the high London standard.
The atmosphere is so very heavy that yesterday we
escaped to Tynemouth for a two hours' sea walk.
There was a high north wind blowing, and a magnificent
sea running. Large vessels were being towed in
and out over the stormy bar, with prodigious waves
breaking on it; and, spanning the restless uproar of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_316" id="Page_3_316">[316]</a></span>
the waters, was a quiet rainbow of transcendent beauty.
The scene was quite wonderful. We were in the full
enjoyment of it when a heavy sea caught us, knocked
us over, and in a moment drenched us and filled even
our pockets. We had nothing for it but to shake ourselves
together (like Dr. Marigold), and dry ourselves
as well as we could by hard walking in the wind and
sunshine. But we were wet through for all that, when
we came back here to dinner after half-an-hour's railway
drive. I am wonderfully well, and quite fresh and
strong." Three days later he was at Leeds; from
which he was to work himself round through the most
important neighbouring places to another reading in
London, before again visiting Ireland.</p>

<p>This was the time of the Fenian excitements; it was
with great reluctance he consented to go;<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> and he told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_317" id="Page_3_317">[317]</a></span>
us all at his first arrival that he should have a complete
breakdown. More than 300 stalls were gone at Belfast
two days before the reading, but on the afternoon of
the reading in Dublin not 50 were taken. Strange to
say however a great crowd pressed in at night, he had
a tumultuous greeting, and on the 22nd of March I had
this announcement from him: "You will be surprised
to be told that we have done <span class="smcap">wonders</span>! Enthusiastic
crowds have filled the halls to the roof each night, and
hundreds have been turned away. At Belfast the night
before last we had &pound;246 5<i>s.</i> In Dublin to-night everything
is sold out, and people are besieging Dolby to
put chairs anywhere, in doorways, on my platform, in
any sort of hole or corner. In short the Readings are
a perfect rage at a time when everything else is beaten
down." He took the Eastern Counties at his return,
and this brought the series to a close. "The reception
at Cambridge was something to be proud of in such a
place. The colleges mustered in full force, from the
biggest guns to the smallest; and went beyond even
Manchester in the roars of welcome and rounds of
cheers. The place was crammed, and all through the
reading everything was taken with the utmost heartiness
of enjoyment." The temptation of offers from America
had meanwhile again been presented to him so strongly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_318" id="Page_3_318">[318]</a></span>
and in such unlucky connection with immediate family
claims threatening excess of expenditure even beyond
the income he was making, that he was fain to write to
his sister-in-law: "I begin to feel myself drawn towards
America as Darnay in the <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>
was attracted to Paris. It is my Loadstone Rock."
Too surely it was to be so; and Dickens was not to be
saved from the consequence of yielding to the temptation,
by any such sacrifice as had rescued Darnay.</p>

<p>The letter which told me of the close of his English
readings had in it no word of the farther enterprise,
yet it seemed to be in some sort a preparation for it.
"Last Monday evening" (14th May) "I finished the
50 Readings with great success. You have no idea
how I have worked at them. Feeling it necessary, as
their reputation widened, that they should be better
than at first, I have <i>learnt them all</i>, so as to have no
mechanical drawback in looking after the words. I
have tested all the serious passion in them by everything
I know; made the humorous points much more
humorous; corrected my utterance of certain words;
cultivated a self-possession not to be disturbed; and
made myself master of the situation. Finishing with
<i>Dombey</i> (which I had not read for a long time) I learnt
that, like the rest; and did it to myself, often twice a day,
with exactly the same pains as at night, over and over
and over again." .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Six days later brought his reply
to a remark that no degree of excellence to which he
might have brought his readings could reconcile me to
what there was little doubt would soon be pressed upon
him. "It is curious" (20th May) "that you should
touch the American subject, because I must confess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_319" id="Page_3_319">[319]</a></span>
that my mind is in a most disturbed state about it.
That the people there have set themselves on having
the readings, there is no question. Every mail brings
me proposals, and the number of Americans at St.
James's Hall has been surprising. A certain Mr. Grau,
who took Ristori out, and is highly responsible, wrote
to me by the last mail (for the second time) saying
that if I would give him a word of encouragement he
would come over immediately and arrange on the
boldest terms for any number I chose, and would deposit
a large sum of money at Coutts's. Mr. Fields
writes to me on behalf of a committee of private gentlemen
at Boston who wished for the credit of getting
me out, who desired to hear the readings and did not
want profit, and would put down as a guarantee
&pound;10,000&mdash;also to be banked here. Every American
speculator who comes to London repairs straight to
Dolby, with similar proposals. And, thus excited,
Chappells, the moment this last series was over, proposed
to treat for America!" Upon the mere question
of these various offers he had little difficulty in making
up his mind. If he went at all, he would go on his
own account, making no compact with any one.
Whether he should go at all, was what he had to
determine.</p>

<p>One thing with his usual sagacity he saw clearly
enough. He must make up his mind quickly. "The
Presidential election would be in the autumn of next
year. They are a people whom a fancy does not hold
long. They are bent upon my reading there, and they
believe (on no foundation whatever) that I am going
to read there. If I ever go, the time would be when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_320" id="Page_3_320">[320]</a></span>
the Christmas number goes to press. Early in this
next November." Every sort of enquiry he accordingly
set on foot; and so far came to the immediate
decision, that, if the answers left him no room to
doubt that a certain sum might be realized, he would
go. "Have no fear that anything will induce me to
make the experiment, if I do not see the most forcible
reasons for believing that what I could get by it, added
to what I have got, would leave me with a sufficient
fortune. I should be wretched beyond expression
there. My small powers of description cannot describe
the state of mind in which I should drag on
from day to day." At the end of May he wrote:
"Poor dear Stanfield!" (our excellent friend had
passed away the week before). "I cannot think even
of him, and of our great loss, for this spectre of doubt
and indecision that sits at the board with me and
stands at the bedside. I am in a tempest-tossed condition,
and can hardly believe that I stand at bay at
last on the American question. The difficulty of determining
amid the variety of statements made to me
is enormous, and you have no idea how heavily the
anxiety of it sits upon my soul. But the prize looks
so large!" One way at last seemed to open by which
it was possible to get at some settled opinion. "Dolby
sails for America" (2nd of July) "on Saturday the 3rd
of August. It is impossible to come to any reasonable
conclusion, without sending eyes and ears on the
actual ground. He will take out my MS. for the
<i>Children's Magazine</i>. I hope it is droll, and very
child-like; though the joke is a grown-up one besides.
You must try to like the pirate story, for I am very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_321" id="Page_3_321">[321]</a></span>
fond of it." The allusion is to his pleasant <i>Holiday
Romance</i> which he had written for Mr. Fields.</p>

<p>Hardly had Mr. Dolby gone when there came that
which should have availed to dissuade, far more than
any of the arguments which continued to express my
objection to the enterprise. "I am laid up," he wrote
on the 6th of August, "with another attack in my foot,
and was on the sofa all last night in tortures. I cannot
bear to have the fomentations taken off for a moment.
I was so ill with it on Sunday, and it looked so fierce,
that I came up to Henry Thompson. He has gone
into the case heartily, and says that there is no doubt
the complaint originates in the action of the shoe, in
walking, on an enlargement in the nature of a bunion.
Erysipelas has supervened upon the injury; and the
object is to avoid a gathering, and to stay the erysipelas
where it is. Meantime I am on my back, and chafing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I didn't improve my foot by going down to
Liverpool to see Dolby off, but I have little doubt of
its yielding to treatment, and repose." A few days
later he was chafing still; the accomplished physician
he consulted having dropped other hints that somewhat
troubled him. "I could not walk a quarter of a mile
to-night for &pound;500. I make out so many reasons against
supposing it to be gouty that I really do not think it is."</p>

<p>So momentous in my judgment were the consequences
of the American journey to him that it seemed right to
preface thus much of the inducements and temptations
that led to it. My own part in the discussion was that
of steady dissuasion throughout: though this might
perhaps have been less persistent if I could have reconciled
myself to the belief, which I never at any time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_322" id="Page_3_322">[322]</a></span>
did, that Public Readings were a worthy employment
for a man of his genius. But it had by this time
become clear to me that nothing could stay the enterprise.
The result of Mr. Dolby's visit to America&mdash;drawn
up by Dickens himself in a paper possessing still
the interest of having given to the Readings when he
crossed the Atlantic much of the form they then assumed<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>&mdash;reached
me when I was staying at Ross; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_323" id="Page_3_323">[323]</a></span>
upon it was founded my last argument against the
scheme. This he received in London on the 28th of
September, on which day he thus wrote to his eldest
daughter: "As I telegraphed after I saw you, I am off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_324" id="Page_3_324">[324]</a></span>
to Ross to consult with Mr. Forster and Dolby together.
You shall hear, either on Monday, or by Monday's
post from London, how I decide finally." The result
he wrote to her three days later: "You will have had
my telegram that I go to America. After a long discussion
with Forster, and consideration of what is to be
said on both sides, I have decided to go through with
it. We have telegraphed 'Yes' to Boston." Seven
days later he wrote to me: "The Scotia being full, I
do not sail until lord mayor's day; for which glorious
anniversary I have engaged an officer's cabin on deck
in the Cuba. I am not in very brilliant spirits at the
prospect before me, and am deeply sensible of your
motive and reasons for the line you have taken; but I
am not in the least shaken in the conviction that I
could never quite have given up the idea."</p>

<p>The remaining time was given to preparations; on
the 2nd of November there was a Farewell Banquet in
the Freemasons' Hall over which Lord Lytton presided;
and on the 9th Dickens sailed for Boston.
Before he left he had contributed his part to the last
of his Christmas Numbers; all the writings he lived to
complete were done; and the interval of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hi'">his</ins> voyage
may be occupied by a general review of the literary
labour of his life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> I have to say generally of Dickens's genius
as a writer may be made part of the notice, which still
remains to be given, of his writings from <i>The Tale of
Two Cities</i> to the time at which we have arrived,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_326" id="Page_3_326">[326]</a></span>
leaving <i>Edwin Drood</i> for mention in its place; and
this will be accompanied, as in former notices of individual
stories, by illustrations drawn from his letters
and life. His literary work was so intensely one with
his nature that he is not separable from it, and the
man and the method throw a singular light on each
other. But some allusion to what has been said of
these books, by writers assuming to speak with authority,
will properly precede what has to be offered
by me; and I shall preface this part of my task with
the hint of Carlyle, that in looking at a man out of the
common it is good for common men to make sure that
they "see" before they attempt to "oversee" him.</p>

<p>Of the French writer, M. Henri Taine, it has before
been remarked that his inability to appreciate humour
is fatal to his pretensions as a critic of the English
novel. But there is much that is noteworthy in his
criticism notwithstanding, as well as remarkable in his
knowledge of our language; his position entitles him
to be heard without a suspicion of partizanship or intentional
unfairness; whatever the value of his opinion,
the elaboration of its form and expression is itself no
common tribute; and what is said in it of Dickens's
handling in regard to style and character, embodies
temperately objections which have since been taken
by some English critics without his impartiality and
with less than his ability. As to style M. Taine does
not find that the natural or simple prevails sufficiently.
The tone is too passionate. The imaginative or poetic
side of allusion is so uniformly dwelt on, that the descriptions
cease to be subsidiary, and the minute details
of pain or pleasure wrought out by them become active<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_327" id="Page_3_327">[327]</a></span>
agencies in the tale. So vivid and eager is the display
of fancy that everything is borne along with it; imaginary
objects take the precision of real ones; living
thoughts are controlled by inanimate things; the
chimes console the poor old ticket-porter; the cricket
steadies the rough carrier's doubts; the sea waves
soothe the dying boy; clouds, flowers, leaves, play
their several parts; hardly a form of matter without
a living quality; no silent thing without its voice.
Fondling and exaggerating thus what is occasional
in the subject of his criticism, into what he has evidently
at last persuaded himself is a fixed and universal
practice with Dickens, M. Taine proceeds to explain
the exuberance by comparing such imagination in its
vividness to that of a monomaniac. He fails altogether
to apprehend that property in Humour which involves
the feeling of subtlest and most affecting analogies,
and from which is drawn the rare insight into sympathies
between the nature of things and their attributes
or opposites, in which Dickens's fancy revelled with
such delight. Taking the famous lines which express
the lunatic, the lover, and the poet as "of Imagination
all compact," in a sense that would have startled not a
little the great poet who wrote them, M. Taine places
on the same level of creative fancy the phantoms of
the lunatic and the personages of the artist. He exhibits
Dickens as from time to time, in the several
stages of his successive works of fiction, given up to
one idea, possessed by it, seeing nothing else, treating
it in a hundred forms, exaggerating it, and so dazzling
and overpowering his readers with it that escape is
impossible. This he maintains to be equally the effect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_328" id="Page_3_328">[328]</a></span>
as Mr. Mell the usher plays the flute, as Tom Pinch
enjoys or exposes his Pecksniff, as the guard blows his
bugle while Tom rides to London, as Ruth Pinch
crosses Fountain Court or makes the beefsteak pudding,
as Jonas Chuzzlewit commits and returns from
the murder, and as the storm which is Steerforth's
death-knell beats on the Yarmouth shore. To the
same kind of power he attributes the extraordinary
clearness with which the commonest objects in all his
books, the most ordinary interiors, any old house,
a parlour, a boat, a school, fifty things that in the
ordinary tale-teller would pass unmarked, are made
vividly present and indelible; are brought out with a
strength of relief, precision, and force, unapproached
in any other writer of prose fiction; with everything
minute yet nothing cold, "with all the passion and
the patience of the painters of his country." And
while excitement in the reader is thus maintained to
an extent incompatible with a natural style or simple
narrative, M. Taine yet thinks he has discovered, in
this very power of awakening a feverish sensibility and
moving laughter or tears at the commonest things,
the source of Dickens's astonishing popularity. Ordinary
people, he says, are so tired of what is always
around them, and take in so little of the detail that
makes up their lives, that when, all of a sudden, there
comes a man to make these things interesting, and
turn them into objects of admiration, tenderness, or
terror, the effect is enchantment. Without leaving
their arm-chairs or their firesides, they find themselves
trembling with emotion, their eyes are filled with tears,
their cheeks are broad with laughter, and, in the discovery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_329" id="Page_3_329">[329]</a></span>
they have thus made that they too can suffer,
love, and feel, their very existence seems doubled to
them. It had not occurred to M. Taine that to effect
so much might seem to leave little not achieved.</p>

<p>So far from it, the critic had satisfied himself that
such a power of style must be adverse to a just delineation
of character. Dickens is not calm enough, he
says, to penetrate to the bottom of what he is dealing
with. He takes sides with it as friend or enemy,
laughs or cries over it, makes it odious or touching,
repulsive or attractive, and is too vehement and not
enough inquisitive to paint a likeness. His imagination
is at once too vivid and not sufficiently large. Its
tenacious quality, and the force and concentration with
which his thoughts penetrate into the details he desires
to apprehend, form limits to his knowledge, confine
him to single traits, and prevent his sounding all the
depths of a soul. He seizes on one attitude, trick,
expression, or grimace; sees nothing else; and keeps
it always unchanged. Mercy Pecksniff laughs at every
word, Mark Tapley is nothing but jolly, Mrs. Gamp
talks incessantly of Mrs. Harris, Mr. Chillip is invariably
timid, and Mr. Micawber is never tired of emphasizing
his phrases or passing with ludicrous brusqueness
from joy to grief. Each is the incarnation of
some one vice, virtue, or absurdity; whereof the display
is frequent, invariable, and exclusive. The language I
am using condenses with strict accuracy what is said by
M. Taine, and has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> by others,
professing admirers as well as open detractors. Mrs.
Gamp and Mr. Micawber, who belong to the first rank
of humorous creation, are thus without another word<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_330" id="Page_3_330">[330]</a></span>
dismissed by the French critic; and he shows no consciousness
whatever in doing it, of that very fault in
himself for which Dickens is condemned, of mistaking
lively observation for real insight.</p>

<p>He has, however much concession in reserve, being
satisfied, by his observation of England, that it is to
the people for whom Dickens wrote his deficiencies in
art are mainly due. The taste of his nation had prohibited
him from representing character in a grand
style. The English require too much morality and
religion for genuine art. They made him treat love,
not as holy and sublime in itself, but as subordinate to
marriage; forced him to uphold society and the laws,
against nature and enthusiasm; and compelled him to
display, in painting such a seduction as in <i>Copperfield</i>,
not the progress, ardour, and intoxication of passion,
but only the misery, remorse, and despair. The result
of such surface religion and morality, combined with
the trading spirit, M. Taine continues, leads to so
many national forms of hypocrisy, and of greed as
well as worship for money, as to justify this great writer
of the nation in his frequent choice of those vices for
illustration in his tales. But his defect of method
again comes into play. He does not deal with vices in
the manner of a physiologist, feeling a sort of love for
them, and delighting in their finer traits as if they were
virtues. He gets angry over them. (I do not interrupt
M. Taine, but surely, to take one instance illustrative
of many, Dickens's enjoyment in dealing with
Pecksniff is as manifest as that he never ceases all the
time to make him very hateful.) He cannot, like
Balzac, leave morality out of account, and treat a passion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_331" id="Page_3_331">[331]</a></span>
however loathsome, as that great tale-teller did,
from the only safe ground of belief, that it is a force,
and that force of whatever kind is good. It is essential
to an artist of that superior grade, M. Taine holds, no
matter how vile his subject, to show its education and
temptations, the form of brain or habits of mind that
have reinforced the natural tendency, to deduce it from
its cause, to place its circumstances around it, and to
develop its effects to their extremes. In handling such
and such a capital miser, hypocrite, debauchee, or
what not, he should never trouble himself about the
evil consequences of the vices. He should be too
much of a philosopher and artist to remember that he
is a respectable citizen. But this is what Dickens never
forgets, and he renounces all beauties requiring so corrupt
a soil. M. Taine's conclusion upon the whole
nevertheless is, that though those triumphs of art which
become the property of all the earth have not been
his, much has yet been achieved by him. Out of his
unequalled observation, his satire, and his sensibility,
has proceeded a series of original characters existing
nowhere but in England, which will exhibit to future
generations not the record of his own genius only, but
that of his country and his times.</p>

<p>Between the judgment thus passed by the distinguished
French lecturer, and the later comment to be
now given from an English critic, certainly not in
arrest of that judgment, may fitly come a passage from
one of Dickens's letters saying something of the limitations
placed upon the artist in England. It may read
like a quasi-confession of one of M. Taine's charges,
though it was not written with reference to his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_332" id="Page_3_332">[332]</a></span>
but to one of Scott's later novels. "Similarly" (15th
of August 1856) "I have always a fine feeling of the
honest state into which we have got, when some smooth
gentleman says to me or to some one else when I am
by, how odd it is that the hero of an English book is
always uninteresting&mdash;too good&mdash;not natural, &amp;c. I
am continually hearing this of Scott from English people
here, who pass their lives with Balzac and Sand.
But O my smooth friend, what a shining impostor you
must think yourself and what an ass you must think
me, when you suppose that by putting a brazen face
upon it you can blot out of my knowledge the fact
that this same unnatural young gentleman (if to be
decent is to be necessarily unnatural), whom you meet
in those other books and in mine, <i>must</i> be presented
to you in that unnatural aspect by reason of your
morality, and is not to have, I will not say any of the
indecencies you like, but not even any of the experiences,
trials, perplexities, and confusions inseparable
from the making or unmaking of all men!"</p>

<p>M. Taine's criticism was written three or four years
before Dickens's death, and to the same date belong
some notices in England which adopted more or less
the tone of depreciation; conceding the great effects
achieved by the writer, but disputing the quality and
value of his art. For it is incident to all such criticism
of Dickens to be of necessity accompanied by the
admission, that no writer has so completely impressed
himself on the time in which he lived, that he has made
his characters a part of literature, and that his readers
are the world.</p>

<p>But, a little more than a year after his death, a paper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_333" id="Page_3_333">[333]</a></span>
was published of which the object was to reconcile such
seeming inconsistency, to expound the inner meanings
of "Dickens in relation to Criticism," and to show
that, though he had a splendid genius and a wonderful
imagination, yet the objectors were to be excused who
called him only a stagy sentimentalist and a clever
caricaturist. This critical essay appeared in the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i> for February 1872, with the signature
of Mr. George Henry Lewes; and the pretentious airs
of the performance, with its prodigious professions of
candour, force upon me the painful task of stating
what it really is. During Dickens's life, especially
when any fresh novelist could be found available for
strained comparison with him, there were plenty of
attempts to write him down: but the trick of studied
depreciation was never carried so far or made so odious
as in this case, by intolerable assumptions of an indulgent
superiority; and to repel it in such a form
once for all is due to Dickens's memory.</p>

<p>The paper begins by the usual concessions&mdash;that he
was a writer of vast popularity, that he delighted no
end of people, that his admirers were in all classes and
all countries, that he stirred the sympathy of masses
not easily reached through literature and always to
healthy emotion, that he impressed a new direction on
popular writing, and modified the literature of his age
in its spirit no less than its form. The very splendour
of these successes, on the other hand, so deepened the
shadow of his failures, that to many there was nothing
but darkness. Was it unnatural? Could greatness be
properly ascribed, by the fastidious, to a writer whose
defects were so glaring, exaggerated, untrue, fantastic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_334" id="Page_3_334">[334]</a></span>
and melodramatic? Might they not fairly insist on
such defects as outweighing all positive qualities, and
speak of him with condescending patronage or sneering
irritation? Why, very often such men, though their
talk would be seasoned with quotations from, and allusions
to, his writings, and though they would lay aside
their most favourite books to bury themselves in his
new "number," had been observed by this critic to be
as niggardly in their praise of him as they were lavish
in their scorn. He actually heard "<i>a very distinguished
man</i>," on one occasion, express measureless contempt
for Dickens, and a few minutes afterwards admit that
Dickens had "entered into his life." And so the critic
betook himself to the task of reconciling this immense
popularity and this critical contempt, which he does
after the following manner.</p>

<p>He says that Dickens was so great in "fun" (humour
he does not concede to him anywhere) that Fielding
and Smollett are small in comparison, but that this
would only have been a passing amusement for the
world if he had not been "gifted with an imagination
of marvellous vividness, and an emotional sympathetic
nature capable of furnishing that imagination with elements
of universal power." To people who think that
words should carry some meaning it might seem, that,
if only a man could be "gifted" with all this, nothing
more need be said. With marvellous imagination, and
a nature to endow it with elements of universal power,
what secrets of creative art could possibly be closed to
him? But this is reckoning without your philosophical
critic. The vividness of Dickens's imagination M.
Taine found to be simply monomaniacal, and his follower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_335" id="Page_3_335">[335]</a></span>
finds it to be merely hallucinative. Not the less
he heaps upon it epithet after epithet. He talks of its
irradiating splendour; calls it glorious as well as imperial
and marvellous; and, to make us quite sure he
is not with these fine phrases puffing-off an inferior
article, he interposes that such imagination is "common
to all great writers." Luckily for great writers in general,
however, their creations are of the old, immortal,
commonplace sort; whereas Dickens in his creative
processes, according to this philosophy of criticism, is
tied up hard and fast within hallucinative limits.</p>

<p>"He was," we are told, "a seer of visions." Amid
silence and darkness, we are assured, he heard voices
and saw objects; of which the revived impressions to
him had the vividness of sensations, and the images
his mind created in explanation of them had the coercive
force of realities;<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> so that what he brought into
existence in this way, no matter how fantastic and
unreal, was (whatever this may mean) universally intelligible.
"His types established themselves in the
public mind like personal experiences. Their falsity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_336" id="Page_3_336">[336]</a></span>
was unnoticed in the blaze of their illumination.
Every humbug seemed a Pecksniff, every jovial improvident
a Micawber, every stinted serving-wench a
Marchioness." The critic, indeed, saw through it all,
but he gave his warnings in vain. "In vain critical
reflection showed these figures to be merely masks; not
characters, but personified characteristics; caricatures
and distortions of human nature. The vividness of
their presentation triumphed over reflection; their
creator managed to communicate to the public his own
unhesitating belief." What, however, is the public?
Mr Lewes goes on to relate. "Give a child a wooden
horse, with hair for mane and tail, and wafer-spots for
colouring, he will never be disturbed by the fact that
this horse does not move its legs but runs on wheels;
and this wooden horse, which he can handle and draw,
is believed in more than a pictured horse by a Wouvermanns
or an Ansdell(!!) It may be said of Dickens's
human figures that they too are wooden, and run on
wheels; but these are details which scarcely disturb the
belief of admirers. Just as the wooden horse is brought
within the range of the child's emotions, and dramatizing
tendencies, when he can handle and draw it,
so Dickens's figures are brought within the range of
the reader's interests, and receive from these interests
a sudden illumination, when they are the puppets of
a drama every incident of which appeals to the sympathies."</p>

<p><i>Risum teneatis?</i> But the smile is grim that rises to
the face of one to whom the relations of the writer and
his critic, while both writer and critic lived, are known;
and who sees the drift of now scattering such rubbish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_337" id="Page_3_337">[337]</a></span>
as this over an established fame. As it fares with the
imagination that is imperial, so with the drama every
incident of which appeals to the sympathies. The one
being explained by hallucination, and the other by the
wooden horse, plenty of fine words are to spare by
which contempt may receive the show of candour.
When the characters in a play are puppets, and the
audiences of the theatre fools or children, no wise man
forfeits his wisdom by proceeding to admit that the
successful playwright, "with a fine felicity of instinct,"
seized upon situations, for his wooden figures, having
"irresistible hold over the domestic affections;" that,
through his puppets, he spoke "in the mother-tongue
of the heart;" that, with his spotted horses and so forth,
he "painted the life he knew and everyone knew;"
that he painted, of course, nothing ideal or heroic, and
that the world of thought and passion lay beyond his
horizon; but that, with his artificial performers and his
feeble-witted audiences, "all the resources of the bourgeois
epic were in his grasp; the joys and pains of childhood,
the petty tyrannies of ignoble natures, the genial
pleasantries of happy natures, the life of the poor, the
struggles of the street and back parlour, the insolence
of office, the sharp social contrasts, east wind and
Christmas jollity, hunger, misery, and hot punch"&mdash;"so
that even critical spectators who complained that
these broadly painted pictures were artistic daubs could
not wholly resist their effective suggestiveness." Since
Trinculo and Caliban were under one cloak, there has
surely been no such delicate monster with two voices.
"His forward voice, now, is to speak well of his friend;
his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_338" id="Page_3_338">[338]</a></span>
detract." One other of the foul speeches I may not
overlook, since it contains what is alleged to be a personal
revelation of Dickens made to the critic himself.</p>

<p>"When one thinks of Micawber always presenting
himself in the same situation, moved with the same
springs and uttering the same sounds, always confident
of something turning up, always crushed and rebounding,
always making punch&mdash;and his wife always declaring
she will never part from him, always referring
to his talents and her family&mdash;when one thinks of the
'catchwords' personified as characters, one is reminded
of the frogs whose brains have been taken out for physiological
purposes, and whose actions henceforth want
the distinctive peculiarity of organic action, that of
fluctuating spontaneity." Such was that sheer inability
of Dickens, indeed, to comprehend this complexity of
the organism, that it quite accounted, in the view of
this philosopher, for all his unnaturalness, for the whole
of his fantastic people, and for the strained dialogues
of which his books are made up, painfully resembling
in their incongruity "the absurd and eager expositions
which insane patients pour into the listener's ear when
detailing their wrongs, or their schemes. Dickens once
declared to me," Mr. Lewes continues, "that every
word said by his characters was distinctly <i>heard</i> by him;
I was at first not a little puzzled to account for the fact
that he could hear language so utterly unlike the language
of real feeling, and not be aware of its preposterousness;
but the surprise vanished when I thought of
the phenomena of hallucination." Wonderful sagacity!
to unravel easily such a bewildering "puzzle"! And
so to the close. Between the uncultivated whom Dickens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_339" id="Page_3_339">[339]</a></span>
moved, and the cultivated he failed to move; between
the power that so worked in <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'delf'">delft</ins> as to stir the universal
heart, and the commonness that could not meddle with
porcelain or aspire to any noble clay; the pitiful see-saw
is continued up to the final sentence, where, in the
impartial critic's eagerness to discredit even the value
of the emotion awakened in such men as Jeffrey by such
creations as Little Nell, he reverses all he has been
saying about the cultivated and uncultivated, and presents
to us a cultivated philosopher, in his ignorance
of the stage, applauding an actor whom every uncultivated
playgoing apprentice despises as stagey. But the
bold stroke just exhibited, of bringing forward Dickens
himself in the actual crisis of one of his fits of hallucination,
requires an additional word.</p>

<p>To establish the hallucinative theory, he is said on
one occasion to have declared to the critic that every
word uttered by his characters was distinctly <i>heard</i> by
him before it was written down. Such an averment,
not credible for a moment as thus made, indeed simply
untrue to the extent described, may yet be accepted in
the limited and quite different sense which a passage in
one of Dickens's letters gives to it. All writers of
genius to whom their art has become as a second nature,
will be found capable of doing upon occasion what the
vulgar may think to be "hallucination," but hallucination
will never account for. After Scott began the
<i>Bride of Lammermoor</i> he had one of his terrible seizures
of cramp, yet during his torment he dictated<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_340" id="Page_3_340">[340]</a></span>
fine novel; and when he rose from his bed, and the
published book was placed in his hands, "he did not,"
James Ballantyne explicitly assured Lockhart, "recollect
one single incident, character, or conversation it
contained." When Dickens was under the greatest
trial of his life, and illness and sorrow were contending
for the mastery over him, he thus wrote to me. "Of
my distress I will say no more than that it has borne a
terrible, frightful, horrible proportion to the quickness
of the gifts you remind me of. But may I not be forgiven
for thinking it a wonderful testimony to my being
made for my art, that when, in the midst of this trouble
and pain, I sit down to my book, some beneficent
power shows it all to me, and tempts me to be interested,
and I don't invent it&mdash;really do not&mdash;<i>but see it</i>,
and write it down.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is only when it all fades away
and is gone, that I begin to suspect that its momentary
relief has cost me something."</p>

<p>Whatever view may be taken of the man who wrote
those words, he had the claim to be judged by reference
to the highest models in the art which he studied.
In the literature of his time, from 1836 to 1870, he held
the most conspicuous place, and his claim to the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_341" id="Page_3_341">[341]</a></span>
popular one in the literature of fiction was by common
consent admitted. He obtained this rank by the sheer
force of his genius, unhelped in any way, and he held
it without dispute. As he began he closed. After he
had written for only four months, and after he had
written incessantly for four and thirty years, he was of
all living writers the most widely read. It is of course
quite possible that such popularity might imply rather
littleness in his contemporaries than greatness in him:
but his books are the test to judge by. Each thus far,
as it appeared, has had notice in these pages for its
illustration of his life, or of his method of work, or of
the variety and versatility in the manifestations of his
power. But his latest books remain still for notice, and
will properly suggest what is farther to be said of his
general place in literature.</p>

<p>His leading quality was Humour. It has no mention
in either of the criticisms cited, but it was his
highest faculty; and it accounts for his magnificent
successes, as well as for his not infrequent failures,
in characteristic delineation. He was conscious of
this himself. Five years before he died, a great and
generous brother artist, Lord Lytton, amid much ungrudging
praise of a work he was then publishing, asked
him to consider, as to one part of it, if the modesties of
art were not a little overpassed. "I cannot tell you,"
he replied, "how highly I prize your letter, or with
what pride and pleasure it inspires me. Nor do I for
a moment question its criticism (if objection so generous
and easy may be called by that hard name)
otherwise than on this ground&mdash;that I work slowly
and with great care, and never give way to my invention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_342" id="Page_3_342">[342]</a></span>
recklessly, but constantly restrain it; and that I
think it is my infirmity to fancy or perceive relations
in things which are not apparent generally. Also, I
have such an inexpressible enjoyment of what I see in
a droll light, that I dare say I pet it as if it were a
spoilt child. This is all I have to offer in arrest of
judgment." To perceive relations in things which are
not apparent generally, is one of those exquisite properties
of humour by which are discovered the affinities
between the high and the low, the attractive and the
repulsive, the rarest things and things of every day,
which bring us all upon the level of a common humanity.
It is this which gives humour an immortal
touch that does not belong of necessity to pictures,
even the most exquisite, of mere character or manners;
the property which in its highest aspects Carlyle so
subtly described as a sort of inverse sublimity, exalting
into our affections what is below us as the other draws
down into our affections what is above us. But it has
a danger which Dickens also hints at, and into which
he often fell. All humour has in it, is indeed identical
with, what ordinary people are apt to call exaggeration;
but there is an excess beyond the allowable even
here, and to "pet" or magnify out of proper bounds
its sense of what is droll, is to put the merely grotesque
in its place. What might have been overlooked in a
writer with no uncommon powers of invention, was
thrown into overpowering prominence by Dickens's
wealth of fancy; and a splendid excess of his genius
came to be objected to as its integral and essential
quality.</p>

<p>It cannot be said to have had any place in his earlier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_343" id="Page_3_343">[343]</a></span>
books. His powers were not at their highest and the
humour was less fine and subtle, but there was no such
objection to be taken. No misgiving interrupted the
enjoyment of the wonderful freshness of animal spirits
in <i>Pickwick;</i> but beneath its fun, laughter, and light-heartedness
were indications of power of the first rank
in the delineation of character. Some caricature was
in the plan; but as the circle of people widened beyond
the cockney club, and the delightful oddity of
Mr. Pickwick took more of an independent existence,
a different method revealed itself, nothing appeared
beyond the exaggerations permissible to humorous
comedy, and the art was seen which can combine
traits vividly true to particular men or women with
propensities common to all mankind. This has its
highest expression in Fielding: but even the first of
Dickens's books showed the same kind of mastery;
and, by the side of its life-like middle-class people
universally familiar, there was one figure before seen
by none but at once knowable by all, delightful for the
surprise it gave by its singularity and the pleasure it
gave by its truth; and, though short of the highest in
this form of art, taking rank with the class in which
live everlastingly the dozen unique inventions that
have immortalized the English novel. The groups in
<i>Oliver Twist</i>, Fagin and his pupils, Sikes and Nancy,
Mr. Bumble and his parish-boy, belong to the same
period; when Dickens also began those pathetic delineations
that opened to the neglected, the poor, and the
fallen, a world of compassion and tenderness. Yet I
think it was not until the third book, <i>Nickleby</i>, that he
began to have his place as a writer conceded to him;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_344" id="Page_3_344">[344]</a></span>
and that he ceased to be regarded as a mere phenomenon
or marvel of fortune, who had achieved success by
any other means than that of deserving it, and who
challenged no criticism better worth the name than
such as he has received from the Fortnightly reviewer.
It is to be added to what before was said of <i>Nickleby</i>,
that it established beyond dispute his mastery of dialogue,
or that power of making characters real existences,
not by describing them but by letting them
describe themselves, which belongs only to story-tellers
of the first rank. Dickens never excelled the easy
handling of the subordinate groups in this novel, and
he never repeated its mistakes in the direction of
aristocratic or merely polite and dissipated life. It
displayed more than before of his humour on the tragic
side; and, in close connection with its affecting scenes
of starved and deserted childhood, were placed those
contrasts of miser and spendthrift, of greed and generosity,
of hypocrisy and simple-heartedness, which he
handled in later books with greater power and fullness,
but of which the first formal expression was here. It
was his first general picture, so to speak, of the character
and manners of his time, which it was the design
more or less of all his books to exhibit; and it suffers
by comparison with his later productions, because the
humour is not to the same degree enriched by imagination;
but it is free from the not infrequent excess
into which that supreme gift also tempted its possessor.
None of the tales is more attractive throughout, and on
the whole it was a step in advance even of the stride
previously taken. Nor was the gain lost in the succeeding
story of the <i>Old Curiosity Shop</i>. The humorous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_345" id="Page_3_345">[345]</a></span>
traits of Mrs. Nickleby could hardly be surpassed:
but, in Dick Swiveller and the Marchioness, there was
a subtlety and lightness of touch that led to finer
issues; and around Little Nell<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> and her fortunes,
surpassingly touching and beautiful, let criticism object
what it will, were gathered some small characters that
had a deeper intention and more imaginative insight,
than anything yet done. Strokes of this kind were
also observable in the hunted life of the murderer in
<i>Barnaby Rudge;</i> and his next book, <i>Chuzzlewit</i>, was,
as it still remains, one of his greatest achievements.
Even so brief a retrospect of the six opening years of
Dickens's literary labour will help to a clearer judgment
of the work of the twenty-eight more years that
remained to him.</p>

<p>To the special observations already made on the series
of stories which followed the return from America,
<i>Chuzzlewit</i>, <i>Dombey</i>, <i>Copperfield</i>, and <i>Bleak House</i>, in
which attention has been directed to the higher purpose
and more imaginative treatment that distinguished
them,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> a general remark is to be added. Though the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_346" id="Page_3_346">[346]</a></span>
range of character they traverse is not wide, it is surrounded
by a fertility of invention and illustration
without example in any previous novelist; and it is
represented in these books, so to speak, by a number
and variety of existences sufficiently real to have taken
places as among the actual people of the world. Could
half as many known and universally recognisable men
and women be selected out of one story, by any other
prose writer of the first rank, as at once rise to the
mind from one of the masterpieces of Dickens? So
difficult of dispute is this, that as much perhaps will be
admitted; but then it will be added, if the reply is by
a critic of the school burlesqued by Mr. Lewes, that
after all they are not individual or special men and
women so much as general impersonations of men and
women, abstract types made up of telling catchwords or
surface traits, though with such accumulation upon them
of a wonderful wealth of humorous illustration, itself
filled with minute and accurate knowledge of life, that
the real nakedness of the land of character is hidden.
Well, what can be rejoined to this, but that the poverty
or richness of any territory worth survey will for the
most part lie in the kind of observation brought to it.
There was no finer observer than Johnson of the
manners of his time, and he protested of their greatest
delineator that he knew only the shell of life. Another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_347" id="Page_3_347">[347]</a></span>
of his remarks, after a fashion followed by the criticizers
of Dickens, places Fielding below one of his famous
contemporaries; but who will not now be eager to
reverse such a comparison, as that Fielding tells you
correctly enough what o'clock it is by looking at the
face of the dial, but that Richardson shows you how
the watch is made? There never was a subtler or a
more sagacious observer than Fielding, or who better
deserved what is generously said of him by Smollett,
that he painted the characters and ridiculed the follies
of life with equal strength, humour, and propriety.
But might it not be said of him, as of Dickens, that
his range of character was limited; and that his method
of proceeding from a central idea in all his leading
people, exposed him equally to the charge of now and
then putting human nature itself in place of the individual
who should only be a small section of it? This
is in fact but another shape of what I have expressed
on a former page, that what a character, drawn by a
master, will roughly present upon its surface, is frequently
such as also to satisfy its more subtle requirements;
and that when only the salient points or
sharper prominences are thus displayed, the great
novelist is using his undoubted privilege of showing
the large degree to which human intercourse is carried
on, not by men's habits or ways at their commonest,
but by the touching of their extremes. A definition
of Fielding's genius has been made with some accuracy
in the saying, that he shows common propensities in
connection with the identical unvarnished adjuncts
which are peculiar to the individual, nor could a more
exquisite felicity of handling than this be any man's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_348" id="Page_3_348">[348]</a></span>
aim or desire; but it would be just as easy, by employment
of the critical rules applied to Dickens, to transform
it into matter of censure. Partridge, Adams,
Trulliber, Squire Western, and the rest, present themselves
often enough under the same aspects, and use
with sufficient uniformity the same catchwords, to be
brought within the charge of mannerism; and though
M. Taine cannot fairly say of Fielding as of Dickens,
that he suffers from too much morality, he brings
against him precisely the charge so strongly put against
the later novelist of "looking upon the passions not as
simple forces but as objects of approbation or blame."
We must keep in mind all this to understand the worth
of the starved fancy, that can find in such a delineation
as that of Micawber only the man described by Mr.
Lewes as always in the same situation, moved with the
same springs and uttering the same sounds, always
confident of something turning up, always crushed and
rebounding, always making punch, and his wife always
declaring she will never part from him. It is not thus
that such creations are to be viewed; but by the light
which enables us to see why the country squires, village
schoolmasters, and hedge parsons of Fielding became
immortal. The later ones will live, as the earlier do,
by the subtle quality of genius that makes their doings
and sayings part of those general incentives which
pervade mankind. Who has not had occasion, however
priding himself on his unlikeness to Micawber, to
think of Micawber as he reviewed his own experiences?
Who has not himself waited, like Micawber, for something
to turn up? Who has not at times discovered,
in one or other acquaintance or friend, some one or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_349" id="Page_3_349">[349]</a></span>
other of that cluster of sagacious hints and fragments
of human life and conduct which the kindly fancy of
Dickens embodied in this delightful form? If the
irrepressible New Zealander ever comes over to achieve
his long promised sketch of St. Paul's, who can doubt
that it will be no other than our undying Micawber,
who had taken to colonisation the last time we saw
him, and who will thus again have turned up? There
are not many conditions of life or society to which his
and his wife's experiences are not applicable; and
when, the year after the immortal couple made their
first appearance on earth, Protection was in one of its
then frequent difficulties, declaring it could not live
without something widely different from existing circumstances
shortly turning up, and imploring its friends
to throw down the gauntlet and boldly challenge society
to turn up a majority and rescue it from its embarrassments,
a distinguished wit seized upon the likeness to
Micawber, showed how closely it was borne out by the
jollity and gin-punch of the banquets at which the
bewailings were heard, and asked whether Dickens had
stolen from the farmer's friends or the farmer's friends
had stolen from Dickens. "Corn, said Mr. Micawber,
may be gentlemanly, but it is not remunerative.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
ask myself this question: if corn is not to be relied on,
what is? We must live.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." Loud as the general
laughter was, I think the laughter of Dickens himself
was loudest, at this discovery of so exact and unexpected
a likeness.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_350" id="Page_3_350">[350]</a></span></p><p>A readiness in all forms thus to enjoy his own pleasantry
was indeed always observable (it is common to
great humourists, nor would it be easier to carry it
farther than Sterne did), and his own confession on
the point may receive additional illustration before proceeding
to the later books. He accounted by it, as we
have seen, for occasional even grotesque extravagances.
In another of his letters there is this passage: "I can
report that I have finished the job I set myself, and
that it has in it something&mdash;to me at all events&mdash;so
extraordinarily droll, that though I have been reading
it some hundred times in the course of the working, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_351" id="Page_3_351">[351]</a></span>
have never been able to look at it with the least composure,
but have always roared in the most unblushing
manner. I leave you to find out what it was." It was
the encounter of the major and the tax-collector in the
second Mrs. Lirriper. Writing previously of the papers
in <i>Household Words</i> called The Lazy Tour of Two Idle
Apprentices, after saying that he and Mr. Wilkie Collins
had written together a story in the second part,
"in which I think you would find it very difficult to
say where I leave off and he comes in," he had said
of the preceding descriptions: "Some of my own
tickle me very much; but that may be in great part
because I know the originals, and delight in their fantastic
fidelity." "I have been at work with such a
will" he writes later of a piece of humour for the holidays,
"that I have done the opening and conclusion
of the Christmas number. They are done in the
character of a waiter, and I think are exceedingly
droll. The thread on which the stories are to hang, is
spun by this waiter, and is, purposely, very slight; but
has, I fancy, a ridiculously comical and unexpected end.
The waiter's account of himself includes (I hope) everything
you know about waiters, presented humorously."
In this last we have a hint of the "fantastic fidelity"
with which, when a fancy "tickled" him, he would
bring out what Corporal Nym calls the humour of it
under so astonishing a variety of conceivable and inconceivable
aspects of subtle exaggeration, that nothing
was left to the subject but that special individual illustration
of it. In this, however, humour was not his
servant but his master; because it reproduced too
readily, and carried too far, the grotesque imaginings to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_352" id="Page_3_352">[352]</a></span>
which great humourists are prone; which lie indeed
deep in their nature; and from which they derive their
genial sympathy with eccentric characters that enables
them to find motives for what to other men is hopelessly
obscure, to exalt into types of humanity what the world
turns impatiently aside at, and to enshrine in a form
for eternal homage and love such whimsical absurdity
as Captain Toby Shandy's. But Dickens was too conscious
of these excesses from time to time, not zealously
to endeavour to keep the leading characters in his more
important stories under some strictness of discipline.
To confine exaggeration within legitimate limits was
an art he laboriously studied; and, in whatever proportions
of failure or success, during the vicissitudes
of both that attended his later years, he continued to
endeavour to practise it. In regard to mere description,
it is true, he let himself loose more frequently,
and would sometimes defend it even on the ground of
art; nor would it be fair to omit his reply, on one
occasion, to some such remonstrance as M. Taine has
embodied in his adverse criticism, against the too great
imaginative wealth thrown by him into mere narrative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_353" id="Page_3_353">[353]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
"It does not seem to me to be enough to say of any
description that it is the exact truth. The exact truth
must be there; but the merit or art in the narrator, is
the manner of stating the truth. As to which thing in
literature, it always seems to me that there is a world
to be done. And in these times, when the tendency
is to be frightfully literal and catalogue-like&mdash;to make
the thing, in short, a sort of sum in reduction that any
miserable creature can do in that way&mdash;I have an idea
(really founded on the love of what I profess), that the
very holding of popular literature through a kind of
popular dark age, may depend on such fanciful treatment."</p>

<div class='center'><br />THE TALE OF TWO CITIES.</div>

<p>Dickens's next story to <i>Little Dorrit</i> was the <i>Tale of
Two Cities</i>, of which the first notion occurred to him
while acting with his friends and his children in the
summer of 1857 in Mr. Wilkie Collins's drama of <i>The
Frozen Deep</i>. But it was only a vague fancy, and the
sadness and trouble of the winter of that year were not
favourable to it. Towards the close (27th) of January
1858, talking of improvements at Gadshill in which
he took little interest, it was again in his thoughts.
"Growing inclinations of a fitful and undefined sort
are upon me sometimes to fall to work on a new book.
Then I think I had better not worry my worried mind
yet awhile. Then I think it would be of no use if I
did, for I couldn't settle to one occupation.&mdash;And that's
all!" "If I can discipline my thoughts," he wrote
three days later, "into the channel of a story, I have
made up my mind to get to work on one: always supposing
that I find myself, on the trial, able to do well.
Nothing whatever will do me the least 'good' in the
way of shaking the one strong possession of change
impending over us that every day makes stronger; but
if I could work on with some approach to steadiness,
through the summer, the anxious toil of a new book
would have its neck well broken before beginning to
publish, next October or November. Sometimes, I
think I may continue to work; sometimes, I think not.
What do you say to the title,<span class="smcap"> One of these DAYS</span>?"
That title held its ground very briefly. "What do you
think," he wrote after six weeks, "of <i>this</i> name for my
story&mdash;<span class="smcap">Buried Alive</span>? Does it seem too grim? Or,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_355" id="Page_3_355">[355]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">The Thread of Gold</span>? Or, <span class="smcap">The Doctor of Beauvais</span>?"
But not until twelve months later did he fairly
buckle himself to the task he had contemplated so long.
<i>All the Year Round</i> had taken the place of <i>Household
Words</i> in the interval; and the tale was then started to
give strength to the new weekly periodical for whose
pages it was designed.</p>

<p>"This is merely to certify," he wrote on the 11th of
March 1859, "that I have got exactly the name for the
story that is wanted; exactly what will fit the opening
to a T. <span class="smcap">A Tale of Two Cities</span>. Also, that I have
struck out a rather original and bold idea. That is, at
the end of each month to publish the monthly part in
the green cover, with the two illustrations, at the old
shilling. This will give <i>All the Year Round</i> always the
interest and precedence of a fresh weekly portion during
the month; and will give me my old standing with my
old public, and the advantage (very necessary in this
story) of having numbers of people who read it in no
portions smaller than a monthly part.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My American
ambassador pays a thousand pounds for the first year,
for the privilege of republishing in America one day
after we publish here. Not bad?" .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He had to
struggle at the opening through a sharp attack of illness,
and on the 9th of July progress was thus reported.
"I have been getting on in health very slowly and
through irksome botheration enough. But I think I
am round the corner. This cause&mdash;and the heat&mdash;has
tended to my doing no more than hold my ground,
my old month's advance, with the <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>.
The small portions thereof, drive me frantic; but I
think the tale must have taken a strong hold. The run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_356" id="Page_3_356">[356]</a></span>
upon our monthly parts is surprising, and last month
we sold 35,000 back numbers. A note I have had from
Carlyle about it has given me especial pleasure." A
letter of the following month expresses the intention
he had when he began the story, and in what respect it
differs as to method from all his other books. Sending
in proof four numbers ahead of the current publication,
he adds: "I hope you will like them. Nothing but
the interest of the subject, and the pleasure of striving
with the difficulty of the form of treatment,&mdash;nothing
in the way of mere money, I mean,&mdash;could else repay
the time and trouble of the incessant condensation.
But I set myself the little task of making a <i>picturesque
story</i>, rising in every chapter, with characters true to
nature, but whom the story should express more than
they should express themselves by dialogue. I mean in
other words, that I fancied a story of incident might be
written (in place of the odious stuff that is written under
that pretence), pounding the characters in its own
mortar, and beating their interest out of them. If you
could have read the story all at once, I hope you
wouldn't have stopped halfway."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Another of his letters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_357" id="Page_3_357">[357]</a></span>
supplies the last illustration I need to give of the
design and meanings in regard to this tale expressed by
himself. It was a reply to some objections of which
the principal were, a doubt if the feudal cruelties came
sufficiently within the date of the action to justify his
use of them, and some question as to the manner of
disposing of the chief revolutionary agent in the plot.
"I had of course full knowledge of the formal surrender
of the feudal privileges, but these had been bitterly
felt quite as near to the time of the Revolution as the
Doctor's narrative, which you will remember dates long
before the Terror. With the slang of the new philosophy
on the one side, it was surely not unreasonable or
unallowable, on the other, to suppose a nobleman
wedded to the old cruel ideas, and representing the
time going out as his nephew represents the time coming
in. If there be anything certain on earth, I take
it that the condition of the French peasant generally at
that day was intolerable. No later enquiries or provings
by figures will hold water against the tremendous
testimony of men living at the time. There is a curious
book printed at Amsterdam, written to make out no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_358" id="Page_3_358">[358]</a></span>
case whatever, and tiresome enough in its literal dictionary-like
minuteness; scattered up and down the
pages of which is full authority for my marquis. This
is Mercier's <i>Tableau de Paris</i>. Rousseau is the authority
for the peasant's shutting up his house when he had
a bit of meat. The tax-tables are the authority for the
wretched creature's impoverishment.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am not clear,
and I never have been clear, respecting the canon of
fiction which forbids the interposition of accident in
such a case as Madame Defarge's death. Where the
accident is inseparable from the passion and action of
the character; where it is strictly consistent with the
entire design, and arises out of some culminating proceeding
on the part of the individual which the whole
story has led up to; it seems to me to become, as it
were, an act of divine justice. And when I use Miss
Pross (though this is quite another question) to bring
about such a catastrophe, I have the positive intention
of making that half-comic intervention a part of the
desperate woman's failure; and of opposing that mean
death, instead of a desperate one in the streets which
she wouldn't have minded, to the dignity of Carton's.
Wrong or right, this was all design, and seemed to me
to be in the fitness of things."</p>

<p>These are interesting intimations of the care with
which Dickens worked; and there is no instance in his
novels, excepting this, of a deliberate and planned
departure from the method of treatment which had
been pre-eminently the source of his popularity as a
novelist. To rely less upon character than upon incident,
and to resolve that his actors should be expressed
by the story more than they should express themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_359" id="Page_3_359">[359]</a></span>
by dialogue, was for him a hazardous, and can hardly
be called an entirely successful, experiment. With
singular dramatic vivacity, much constructive art, and
with descriptive passages of a high order everywhere
(the dawn of the terrible outbreak in the journey of
the marquis from Paris to his country seat, and the
London crowd at the funeral of the spy, may be instanced
for their power), there was probably never a
book by a great humourist, and an artist so prolific in
the conception of character, with so little humour and
so few rememberable figures. Its merits lie elsewhere.
Though there are excellent traits and touches all
through the revolutionary scenes, the only full-length
that stands out prominently is the picture of the wasted
life saved at last by heroic sacrifice. Dickens speaks
of his design to make impressive the dignity of Carton's
death, and in this he succeeded perhaps even
beyond his expectation. Carton suffers himself to be
mistaken for another, and gives his life that the girl he
loves may be happy with that other; the secret being
known only to a poor little girl in the tumbril that
takes them to the scaffold, who at the moment has discovered
it, and whom it strengthens also to die. The
incident is beautifully told; and it is at least only fair
to set against verdicts not very favourable as to this
effort of his invention, what was said of the particular
character and scene, and of the book generally, by an
American critic whose literary studies had most familiarized
him with the rarest forms of imaginative
writing.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> "Its pourtrayal of the noble-natured castaway<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_360" id="Page_3_360">[360]</a></span>
makes it almost a peerless book in modern literature,
and gives it a place among the highest examples
of literary art.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The conception of this character
shows in its author an ideal of magnanimity and of
charity unsurpassed. There is not a grander, lovelier
figure than the self-wrecked, self-devoted Sydney Carton,
in literature or history; and the story itself is so
noble in its spirit, so grand and graphic in its style,
and filled with a pathos so profound and simple, that
it deserves and will surely take a place among the great
serious works of imagination." I should myself prefer
to say that its distinctive merit is less in any of its
conceptions of character, even Carton's, than as a
specimen of Dickens's power in imaginative story-telling.
There is no piece of fiction known to me, in
which the domestic life of a few simple private people
is in such a manner knitted and interwoven with the
outbreak of a terrible public event, that the one seems
but part of the other. When made conscious of the
first sultry drops of a thunderstorm that fall upon a
little group sitting in an obscure English lodging, we
are witness to the actual beginning of a tempest which
is preparing to sweep away everything in France. And,
to the end, the book in this respect is really remarkable.</p>


<div class='center'><br />GREAT EXPECTATIONS.</div>

<p>The <i>Tale of Two Cities</i> was published in 1859; the
series of papers collected as the <i>Uncommercial Traveller</i>
were occupying Dickens in 1860; and it was while engaged
in these, and throwing off in the course of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_361" id="Page_3_361">[361]</a></span>
capital "samples" of fun and enjoyment, he thus replied
to a suggestion that he should let himself loose
upon some single humorous conception, in the vein of
his youthful achievements in that way. "For a little
piece I have been writing&mdash;or am writing; for I hope
to finish it to-day&mdash;such a very fine, new, and grotesque
idea has opened upon me, that I begin to doubt whether
I had not better cancel the little paper, and reserve the
notion for a new book. You shall judge as soon as I
get it printed. But it so opens out before <i>me</i> that I
can see the whole of a serial revolving on it, in a most
singular and comic manner." This was the germ of
Pip and Magwitch, which at first he intended to make
the groundwork of a tale in the old twenty-number
form, but for reasons perhaps fortunate brought afterwards
within the limits of a less elaborate novel. "Last
week," he wrote on the 4th of October 1860, "I got
to work on the new story. I had previously very carefully
considered the state and prospects of <i>All the Year
Round</i>, and, the more I considered them, the less hope
I saw of being able to get back, <i>now</i>, to the profit of a
separate publication in the old 20 numbers." (A tale,
which at the time was appearing in his serial, had disappointed
expectation.) "However I worked on,
knowing that what I was doing would run into another
groove; and I called a council of war at the office on
Tuesday. It was perfectly clear that the one thing to
be done was, for me to strike in. I have therefore
decided to begin the story as of the length of the <i>Tale
of Two Cities</i> on the first of December&mdash;begin publishing,
that is. I must make the most I can out of the
book. You shall have the first two or three weekly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_362" id="Page_3_362">[362]</a></span>
parts to-morrow. The name is <span class="smcap">Great Expectations</span>.
I think a good name?" Two days later he wrote:
"The sacrifice of <i>Great Expectations</i> is really and truly
made for myself. The property of <i>All the Year Round</i>
is far too valuable, in every way, to be much endangered.
Our fall is not large, but we have a considerable
advance in hand of the story we are now
publishing, and there is no vitality in it, and no chance
whatever of stopping the fall; which on the contrary
would be certain to increase. Now, if I went into a
twenty-number serial, I should cut off my power of
doing anything serial here for two good years&mdash;and
that would be a most perilous thing. On the other
hand, by dashing in now, I come in when most wanted;
and if Reade and Wilkie follow me, our course will be
shaped out handsomely and hopefully for between two
and three years. A thousand pounds are to be paid
for early proofs of the story to America." A few more
days brought the first instalment of the tale, and explanatory
mention of it. "The book will be written
in the first person throughout, and during these first
three weekly numbers you will find the hero to be a
boy-child, like David. Then he will be an apprentice.
You will not have to complain of the want of humour
as in the <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>. I have made the opening,
I hope, in its general effect exceedingly droll. I
have put a child and a good-natured foolish man, in
relations that seem to me very funny. Of course I
have got in the pivot on which the story will turn too&mdash;and
which indeed, as you remember, was the grotesque
tragi-comic conception that first encouraged me.
To be quite sure I had fallen into no unconscious repetitions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_363" id="Page_3_363">[363]</a></span>
I read <i>David Copperfield</i> again the other day,
and was affected by it to a degree you would hardly
believe."</p>

<p>It may be doubted if Dickens could better have
established his right to the front rank among novelists
claimed for him, than by the ease and mastery with
which, in these two books of <i>Copperfield</i> and <i>Great
Expectations</i>, he kept perfectly distinct the two stories
of a boy's childhood, both told in the form of autobiography.
A subtle penetration into character marks
the unlikeness in the likeness; there is enough at once
of resemblance and of difference in the position and
surroundings of each to account for the divergences of
character that arise; both children are good-hearted,
and both have the advantage of association with models
of tender simplicity and oddity, perfect in their truth
and quite distinct from each other; but a sudden tumble
into distress steadies Peggotty's little friend, and as
unexpected a stroke of good fortune turns the head of
the small prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Joe Gargery. What a deal of
spoiling nevertheless, a nature that is really good at the
bottom of it will stand without permanent damage, is
nicely shown in Pip; and the way he reconciles his
determination to act very shabbily to his early friends,
with a conceited notion that he is setting them a moral
example, is part of the shading of a character drawn
with extraordinary skill. His greatest trial comes out
of his good luck; and the foundations of both are laid
at the opening of the tale, in a churchyard down by
the Thames, as it winds past desolate marshes twenty
miles to the sea, of which a masterly picture in half a
dozen lines will give only average example of the descriptive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_364" id="Page_3_364">[364]</a></span>
writing that is everywhere one of the charms
of the book. It is strange, as I transcribe the words,
with what wonderful vividness they bring back the
very spot on which we stood when he said he meant to
make it the scene of the opening of his story&mdash;Cooling
Castle ruins and the desolate Church, lying out among
the marshes seven miles from Gadshill! "My first
most vivid and broad impression .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on a memorable
raw afternoon towards evening .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that this
bleak place, overgrown with nettles, was the churchyard,
and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the
churchyard, intersected with dykes and mounds and
gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the
marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond, was the
river; and that the distant savage lair from which the
wind was rushing, was the sea.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On the edge of
the river .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only two black things in all the prospect
seemed to be standing upright .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one, the beacon by
which the sailors steered, like an unhooped cask upon
a pole, an ugly thing when you were near it; the other,
a gibbet with some chains hanging to it which had once
held a pirate." Here Magwitch, an escaped convict
from Chatham, terrifies the child Pip into stealing for
him food and a file; and though recaptured and transported,
he carries with him to Australia such a grateful
heart for the small creature's service, that on making a
fortune there he resolves to make his little friend a
gentleman. This requires circumspection; and is so
done, through the Old-Bailey attorney who has defended
Magwitch at his trial (a character of surprising novelty
and truth), that Pip imagines his present gifts and
"great expectations" to have come from the supposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_365" id="Page_3_365">[365]</a></span>
rich lady of the story (whose eccentricities are the
unattractive part of it, and have yet a weird character
that somehow fits in with the kind of wrong she has
suffered). When therefore the closing scenes bring
back Magwitch himself, who risks his life to gratify his
longing to see the gentleman he has made, it is an
unspeakable horror to the youth to discover his benefactor
in the convicted felon. If any one doubts
Dickens's power of so drawing a character as to get to
the heart of it, seeing beyond surface peculiarities into
the moving springs of the human being himself, let
him narrowly examine those scenes. There is not a
grain of substitution of mere sentiment, or circumstance,
for the inner and absolute reality of the position
in which these two creatures find themselves.
Pip's loathing of what had built up his fortune, and
his horror of the uncouth architect, are apparent in
even his most generous efforts to protect him from
exposure and sentence. Magwitch's convict habits
strangely blend themselves with his wild pride in, and
love for, the youth whom his money has turned into a
gentleman. He has a craving for his good opinion;
dreads to offend him by his "heavy grubbing," or by
the oaths he lets fall now and then; and pathetically
hopes his Pip, his dear boy, won't think him "low":
but, upon a chum of Pip's appearing unexpectedly
while they are together, he pulls out a jack-knife by
way of hint he can defend himself, and produces afterwards
a greasy little clasped black Testament on which
the startled new-comer, being found to have no hostile
intention, is sworn to secrecy. At the opening
of the story there had been an exciting scene of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_366" id="Page_3_366">[366]</a></span>
the wretched man's chase and recapture among the
marshes, and this has its parallel at the close in his
chase and recapture on the river while poor Pip is
helping to get him off. To make himself sure of the
actual course of a boat in such circumstances, and
what possible incidents the adventure might have,
Dickens hired a steamer for the day from Blackwall
to Southend. Eight or nine friends and three or four
members of his family were on board, and he seemed
to have no care, the whole of that summer day (22nd
of May 1861), except to enjoy their enjoyment and
entertain them with his own in shape of a thousand
whims and fancies; but his sleepless observation was at
work all the time, and nothing had escaped his keen
vision on either side of the river. The fifteenth chapter
of the third volume is a masterpiece.</p>

<p>The characters generally afford the same evidence
as those two that Dickens's humour, not less than his
creative power, was at its best in this book. The Old-Bailey
attorney Jaggers, and his clerk Wemmick (both
excellent, and the last one of the oddities that live in
everybody's liking for the goodheartedness of its humorous
surprises), are as good as his earliest efforts in
that line; the Pumblechooks and Wopsles are perfect
as bits of <i>Nickleby</i> fresh from the mint; and the scene
in which Pip, and Pip's chum Herbert, make up their
accounts and schedule their debts and obligations, is
original and delightful as Micawber himself. It is the
art of living upon nothing and making the best of it,
in the most pleasing form. Herbert's intentions to
trade east and west, and get himself into business
transactions of a magnificent extent and variety, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_367" id="Page_3_367">[367]</a></span>
as perfectly warranted to us, in his way of putting
them, by merely "being in a counting-house and looking
about you," as Pip's means of paying his debts are
lightened and made easy by his method of simply
adding them up with a margin. "The time comes,"
says Herbert, "when you see your opening. And you
go in, and you swoop upon it, and you make your
capital, and then there you are! When you have once
made your capital you have nothing to do but employ
it." In like manner Pip tells us "Suppose your debts
to be one hundred and sixty four pounds four and two-pence,
I would say, leave a margin and put them down
at two hundred; or suppose them to be four times as
much, leave a margin and put them down at seven
hundred." He is sufficiently candid to add, that,
while he has the highest opinion of the wisdom and
prudence of the margin, its dangers are that in the
sense of freedom and solvency it imparts there is a
tendency to run into new debt. But the satire that
thus enforces the old warning against living upon vague
hopes, and paying ancient debts by contracting new
ones, never presented itself in more amusing or kindly
shape. A word should be added of the father of the
girl that Herbert marries, Bill Barley, ex-ship's purser,
a gouty, bed-ridden, drunken old rascal, who lies on
his back in an upper floor on Mill Pond Bank by
Chinks's Basin, where he keeps, weighs, and serves out
the family stores or provisions, according to old professional
practice, with one eye at a telescope which is
fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the
river. This is one of those sketches, slight in itself
but made rich with a wealth of comic observation, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_368" id="Page_3_368">[368]</a></span>
which Dickens's humour took especial delight; and to
all this part of the story, there is a quaint riverside
flavour that gives it amusing reality and relish.</p>

<p>Sending the chapters that contain it, which open
the third division of the tale, he wrote thus: "It is a
pity that the third portion cannot be read all at once,
because its purpose would be much more apparent;
and the pity is the greater, because the general turn
and tone of the working out and winding up, will be
away from all such things as they conventionally go.
But what must be, must be. As to the planning out
from week to week, nobody can imagine what the difficulty
is, without trying. But, as in all such cases,
when it is overcome the pleasure is proportionate.
Two months more will see me through it, I trust. All
the iron is in the fire, and I have 'only' to beat it out."
One other letter throws light upon an objection taken
not unfairly to the too great speed with which the
heroine, after being married, reclaimed, and widowed,
is in a page or two again made love to, and remarried
by the hero. This summary proceeding was not originally
intended. But, over and above its popular acceptance,
the book had interested some whose opinions
Dickens specially valued (Carlyle among them, I remember);<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
and upon Bulwer Lytton objecting to a
close that should leave Pip a solitary man, Dickens
substituted what now stands. "You will be surprised"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_369" id="Page_3_369">[369]</a></span>
he wrote "to hear that I have changed the end of
<i>Great Expectations</i> from and after Pip's return to Joe's,
and finding his little likeness there. Bulwer, who has
been, as I think you know, extraordinarily taken by
the book, so strongly urged it upon me, after reading
the proofs, and supported his view with such good
reasons, that I resolved to make the change. You shall
have it when you come back to town. I have put in
as pretty a little piece of writing as I could, and I have
no doubt the story will be more acceptable through the
alteration." This turned out to be the case; but the
first ending nevertheless seems to be more consistent
with the drift, as well as natural working out, of the
tale, and for this reason it is preserved in a note.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<div class='center'><br />CHRISTMAS SKETCHES.</div>

<p>Between that fine novel, which was issued in three
volumes in the autumn of 1861, and the completion of
his next serial story, were interposed three sketches in
his happiest vein at which everyone laughed and cried
in the Christmas times of 1862, '3, and '4. Of the
waiter in <i>Somebody's Luggage</i> Dickens has himself
spoken; and if any theme is well treated, when, from
the point of view taken, nothing more is left to say
about it, that bit of fun is perfect. Call it exaggeration,
grotesqueness, or by what hard name you will,
laughter will always intercept any graver criticism.
Writing from Paris of what he was himself responsible
for in the articles left by Somebody with his wonderful
Waiter, he said that in one of them he had made the
story a camera obscura of certain French places and
styles of people; having founded it on something he
had noticed in a French soldier. This was the tale of
Little Bebelle, which had a small French corporal for
its hero, and became highly popular. But the triumph
of the Christmas achievements in these days was Mrs.
Lirriper. She took her place at once among people
known to everybody; and all the world talked of Major
Jemmy Jackman, and his friend the poor elderly lodging-house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_371" id="Page_3_371">[371]</a></span>
keeper of the Strand, with her miserable
cares and rivalries and worries, as if they had both
been as long in London and as well known as Norfolk-street
itself. A dozen volumes could not have told
more than those dozen pages did. The <i>Legacy</i> followed
the <i>Lodgings</i> in 1864, and there was no falling off in
the fun and laughter.</p>


<div class='center'><br />OUR MUTUAL FRIEND.</div>

<p>The publication of <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, in the form
of the earliest stories, extended from May 1864 to November
1865. Four years earlier he had chosen this
title as a good one, and he held to it through much
objection. Between that time and his actual commencement
there is mention, in his letters, of the three
leading notions on which he founded the story. In his
water-side wanderings during his last book, the many
handbills he saw posted up, with dreary description of
persons drowned in the river, suggested the 'long shore
men and their ghastly calling whom he sketched in
Hexam and Riderhood, "I think," he had written,
"a man, young and perhaps eccentric, feigning to be
dead, and <i>being</i> dead to all intents and purposes external
to himself, and for years retaining the singular view
of life and character so imparted, would be a good
leading incident for a story;" and this he partly did
in Rokesmith. For other actors in the tale, he had
thought of "a poor impostor of a man marrying a
woman for her money; she marrying <i>him</i> for <i>his</i> money;
after marriage both finding out their mistake, and entering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_372" id="Page_3_372">[372]</a></span>
into a league and covenant against folks in general:"
with whom he had proposed to connect some Perfectly
New people. "Everything new about them. If they
presented a father and mother, it seemed as if <span class="smcap">they</span>
must be bran new, like the furniture and the carriages&mdash;shining
with varnish, and just home from the manufacturers."
These groups took shape in the Lammles
and the Veneerings. "I must use somehow," is the
remark of another letter, "the uneducated father in
fustian and the educated boy in spectacles whom Leech
and I saw at Chatham;" of which a hint is in Charley
Hexam and his father. The benevolent old Jew whom
he makes the unconscious agent of a rascal, was meant
to wipe out a reproach against his Jew in <i>Oliver Twist</i>
as bringing dislike upon the religion of the race he
belonged to.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Having got his title in '61 it was his hope to have
begun in '62. "Alas!" he wrote in the April of that
year, "I have hit upon nothing for a story. Again and
again I have tried. But this odious little house" (he
had at this time for a few weeks exchanged Gadshill
for a friend's house near Kensington) "seems to have
stifled and darkened my invention." It was not until
the autumn of the following year he saw his way to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_373" id="Page_3_373">[373]</a></span>
beginning. "The Christmas number has come round
again" (30th of August 1863)&mdash;"it seems only yesterday
that I did the last&mdash;but I am full of notions besides
for the new twenty numbers. When I can clear the
Christmas stone out of the road, I think I can dash into
it on the grander journey." He persevered through
much difficulty; which he described six weeks later,
with characteristic glance at his own ways when writing,
in a letter from the office of his journal. "I came here
last night, to evade my usual day in the week&mdash;in fact
to shirk it&mdash;and get back to Gad's for five or six consecutive
days. My reason is, that I am exceedingly
anxious to begin my book. I am bent upon getting to
work at it. I want to prepare it for the spring; but
I am determined not to begin to publish with less
than five numbers done. I see my opening perfectly,
with the one main line on which the story is to turn;
and if I don't strike while the iron (meaning myself) is
hot, I shall drift off again, and have to go through all
this uneasiness once more."</p>

<p>He had written, after four months, very nearly three
numbers, when upon a necessary rearrangement of his
chapters he had to hit upon a new subject for one of
them. "While I was considering" (25th of February)
"what it should be, Marcus,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> who has done an excellent
cover, came to tell me of an extraordinary trade he had
found out, through one of his painting requirements.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_374" id="Page_3_374">[374]</a></span>
I immediately went with him to Saint Giles's to look at
the place, and found&mdash;what you will see." It was the
establishment of Mr. Venus, preserver of animals and
birds, and articulator of human bones; and it took
the place of the last chapter of No. 2, which was then
transferred to the end of No. 3. But a start with three
full numbers done, though more than enough to satisfy
the hardest self-conditions formerly, did not satisfy him
now. With his previous thought given to the story,
with his Memoranda to help him, with the people he
had in hand to work it with, and ready as he still was
to turn his untiring observation to instant use on its
behalf, he now moved, with the old large canvas before
him, somewhat slowly and painfully. "If I were to
lose" (29th of March) "a page of the five numbers I
have proposed to myself to be ready by the publication
day, I should feel that I had fallen short. I have grown
hard to satisfy, and write very slowly. And I have so
much&mdash;not fiction&mdash;that <i>will</i> be thought of, when I
don't want to think of it, that I am forced to take
more care than I once took."</p>

<p>The first number was launched at last, on the first of
May; and after two days he wrote: "Nothing can be
better than <i>Our Friend</i>, now in his thirtieth thousand,
and orders flowing in fast." But between the first and
second number there was a drop of five thousand,
strange to say, for the larger number was again reached,
and much exceeded, before the book closed. "This
leaves me" (10th of June) "going round and round like
a carrier-pigeon before swooping on number seven."
Thus far he had held his ground; but illness came,
with some other anxieties, and on the 29th of July he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_375" id="Page_3_375">[375]</a></span>
wrote sadly enough. "Although I have not been
wanting in industry, I have been wanting in invention,
and have fallen back with the book. Looming large
before me is the Christmas work, and I can hardly
hope to do it without losing a number of <i>Our Friend</i>.
I have very nearly lost one already, and two would
take one half of my whole advance. This week I have
been very unwell; am still out of sorts; and, as I know
from two days' slow experience, have a very mountain
to climb before I shall see the open country of my
work." The three following months brought hardly
more favourable report. "I have not done my number.
This death of poor Leech (I suppose) has put me
out woefully. Yesterday and the day before I could
do nothing; seemed for the time to have quite lost the
power; and am only by slow degrees getting back into
the track to-day." He rallied after this, and satisfied
himself for a while; but in February 1865 that formidable
illness in his foot broke out which, at certain times
for the rest of his life, deprived him more or less of his
inestimable solace of bodily exercise. In April and
May he suffered severely; and after trying the sea went
abroad for more complete change. "Work and worry,
without exercise, would soon make an end of me. If
I were not going away now, I should break down. No
one knows as I know to-day how near to it I have
been."</p>

<p>That was the day of his leaving for France, and the
day of his return brought these few hurried words.
"Saturday, tenth of June, 1865. I was in the terrific
Staplehurst accident yesterday, and worked for hours
among the dying and dead. I was in the carriage that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_376" id="Page_3_376">[376]</a></span>
did not go over, but went off the line, and hung over
the bridge in an inexplicable manner. No words can
describe the scene.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> I am away to Gads." Though
with characteristic energy he resisted the effects upon
himself of that terrible ninth of June, they were for
some time evident; and, up to the day of his death on
its fatal fifth anniversary, were perhaps never wholly
absent. But very few complaints fell from him. "I
am curiously weak&mdash;weak as if I were recovering from
a long illness." "I begin to feel it more in my head.
I sleep well and eat well; but I write half a dozen notes,
and turn faint and sick." "I am getting right, though
still low in pulse and very nervous. Driving into
Rochester yesterday I felt more shaken than I have
since the accident." "I cannot bear railway travelling
yet. A perfect conviction, against the senses, that
the carriage is down on one side (and generally that is
the left, and <i>not</i> the side on which the carriage in the
accident really went over), comes upon me with anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_377" id="Page_3_377">[377]</a></span>
like speed, and is inexpressibly distressing."
These are passages from his letters up to the close of
June. Upon his book the immediate result was that
another lost number was added to the losses of the preceding
months, and "alas!" he wrote at the opening
of July, "for the two numbers you write of! There is
only one in existence. I have but just begun the
other." "Fancy!" he added next day, "fancy my
having under-written number sixteen by two and a
half pages&mdash;a thing I have not done since <i>Pickwick!</i>"
He did it once with <i>Dombey</i>, and was to do it yet again.</p>

<p>The book thus begun and continued under adverse
influences, though with fancy in it, descriptive power,
and characters well designed, will never rank with his
higher efforts. It has some pictures of a rare veracity
of soul amid the lowest forms of social degradation,
placed beside others of sheer falsehood and pretence
amid unimpeachable social correctness, which lifted
the writer to his old place; but the judgment of it on
the whole must be, that it wants freshness and natural
development. This indeed will be most freely admitted
by those who feel most strongly that all the old cunning
of the master hand is yet in the wayward loving Bella
Wilfer, in the vulgar canting Podsnap, and in the dolls'
dressmaker Jenny Wren, whose keen little quaint weird
ways, and precocious wit sharpened by trouble, are
fitted into a character as original and delightfully conceived
as it is vividly carried through to the last. A
dull coarse web her small life seems made of; but even
from its taskwork, which is undertaken for childhood
itself, there are glittering threads cast across its woof
and warp of care. The unconscious philosophy of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_378" id="Page_3_378">[378]</a></span>
tricks and manners has in it more of the subtler vein
of the satire aimed at in the book, than even the voices
of society which the tale begins and ends with. In her
very kindliness there is the touch of malice that shows
a childish playfulness familiar with unnatural privations;
this gives a depth as well as tenderness to her humours
which entitles them to rank with the writer's happiest
things; and though the odd little creature's talk is
incessant when she is on the scene, it has the individuality
that so seldom tires. It is veritably her own
small "trick" and "manner," and is never mistakeable
for any one else's. "I have been reading," Dickens
wrote to me from France while he was writing the
book, "a capital little story by Edmond About&mdash;<i>The
Notary's Nose</i>. I have been trying other books; but
so infernally conversational, that I forget who the
people are before they have done talking, and don't in
the least remember what they talked about before when
they begin talking again!" The extreme contrast to
his own art could not be defined more exactly; and
other examples from this tale will be found in the differing
members of the Wilfer family, in the riverside
people at the Fellowship Porters, in such marvellous
serio-comic scenes as that of Rogue Riderhood's restoration
from drowning, and in those short and simple
annals of Betty Higden's life and death which might
have given saving virtue to a book more likely than
this to perish prematurely. It has not the creative
power which crowded his earlier page, and transformed
into popular realities the shadows of his fancy; but the
observation and humour he excelled in are not wanting
to it, nor had there been, in his first completed work,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_379" id="Page_3_379">[379]</a></span>
more eloquent or generous pleading for the poor and
neglected, than this last completed work contains.
Betty Higden finishes what Oliver Twist began.</p>


<div class='center'><br />DR. MARIGOLD AND TALES FOR AMERICA.</div>

<p>He had scarcely closed that book in September,
wearied somewhat with a labour of invention which
had not been so free or self-sustaining as in the old
facile and fertile days, when his customary contribution
to Christmas became due from him; and his fancy, let
loose in a narrower field, resumed its old luxury of
enjoyment. Here are notices of it from his letters.
"If people at large understand a Cheap Jack, my part
of the Christmas number will do well. It is wonderfully
like the real thing, of course a little refined and
humoured." "I do hope that in the beginning and
end of this Christmas number you will find something
that will strike you as being fresh, forcible, and full of
spirits." He described its mode of composition afterwards.
"Tired with <i>Our Mutual</i>, I sat down to cast
about for an idea, with a depressing notion that I was,
for the moment, overworked. Suddenly, the little character
that you will see, and all belonging to it, came
flashing up in the most cheerful manner, and I had
only to look on and leisurely describe it." This was
<i>Dr. Marigold's Prescriptions</i>, one of the most popular
of all the pieces selected for his readings, and a splendid
example of his humour, pathos, and character. There
were three more Christmas pieces before he made his
last visit to America: <i>Barbox Brothers</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_380" id="Page_3_380">[380]</a></span> <i>The Boy at
Mugby Station</i>, and <i>No Thoroughfare:</i> the last a joint
piece of work with Mr. Wilkie Collins, who during
Dickens's absence in the States transformed it into a
play for Mr. Fechter, with a view to which it had been
planned originally. There were also two papers written
for first publication in America, <i>George Silverman's
Explanation</i>, and <i>Holiday Romance</i>, containing about
the quantity of half a shilling number of his ordinary
serials, and paid for at a rate unexampled in literature.
They occupied him not many days in the writing, and
he received a thousand pounds for them.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The year after his return, as the reader knows, saw
the commencement of the work which death interrupted.
The fragment will hereafter be described;
and here meanwhile may close my criticism&mdash;itself a
fragment left for worthier completion by a stronger
hand than mine.</p>

<p>But at least I may hope that the ground has been
cleared by it from those distinctions and comparisons
never safely to be applied to an original writer, and
which always more or less intercept his fair appreciation.
It was long the fashion to set up wide divergences
between novels of incident and manners, and
novels of character; the narrower range being left to
Fielding and Smollett, and the larger to Richardson;
yet there are not many now who will accept such
classification. Nor is there more truth in other like
distinctions alleged between novelists who are assumed
to be real, or ideal, in their methods of treatment.
To any original novelist of the higher grade there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_381" id="Page_3_381">[381]</a></span>
no meaning in these contrasted phrases. Neither mode
can exist at all perfectly without the other. No matter
how sensitive the mind to external impressions, or how
keen the observation to whatever can be seen, without
the rarer seeing of imagination nothing will be arrived
at that is real in any genuine artist-sense. Reverse the
proposition, and the result is expressed in an excellent
remark of Lord Lytton's, that the happiest effort of
imagination, however lofty it may be, is that which
enables it to be cheerfully at home with the real. I
have said that Dickens felt criticism, of whatever kind,
with too sharp a relish for the indifference he assumed
to it; but the secret was that he believed himself to be
entitled to higher tribute than he was always in the
habit of receiving. It was the feeling which suggested
a memorable saying of Wordsworth. "I am not at all
desirous that any one should write a critique on my
poems. If they be from above, they will do their own
work in course of time; if not, they will perish as they
ought."</p>

<p>The something "from above" never seems to be
absent from Dickens, even at his worst. When the
strain upon his invention became apparent, and he
could only work freely in a more confined space than
of old, it was still able to assert itself triumphantly;
and his influence over his readers was continued by it
to the last day of his life. Looking back over the
series of his writings, the first reflection that rises to
the mind of any thoughtful person, is one of thankfulness
that the most popular of writers, who had carried
into the lowest scenes and conditions an amount of
observation, fun, and humour not approached by any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_382" id="Page_3_382">[382]</a></span>
of his contemporaries, should never have sullied that
world-wide influence by a hint of impurity or a possibility
of harm. Nor is there anything more surprising
than the freshness and variety of character which those
writings include, within the range of the not numerous
types of character that were the limit of their author's
genius. For, this also appears, upon any review of
them collectively, that the teeming life which is in
them is that of the time in which his own life was
passed; and that with the purpose of showing vividly
its form and pressure, was joined the hope and design
to leave it better than he found it. It has been objected
that humanity receives from him no addition to its best
types; that the burlesque humourist is always stronger
in him than the reflective moralist; that the light thrown
by his genius into out of the way corners of life never
steadily shines in its higher beaten ways; and that beside
his pictures of what man is or does, there is no
attempt to show, by delineation of an exalted purpose
or a great career, what man is able to be or to do. In
the charge abstractedly there is truth; but the fair remark
upon it is that whatever can be regarded as essential
in the want implied by it will be found in other
forms in his writings, that the perfect innocence of
their laughter and tears has been itself a prodigious
blessing, and that it is otherwise incident to so great a
humourist to work after the fashion most natural to the
genius of humour. What kind of work it has been in
his case, the attempt is made in preceding pages to
show; and on the whole it can be said with some certainty
that the best ideals in this sense are obtained,
not by presenting with added comeliness or grace the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_383" id="Page_3_383">[383]</a></span>
figures which life is ever eager to present as of its best,
but by connecting the singularities and eccentricities,
which ordinary life is apt to reject or overlook, with the
appreciation that is deepest and the laws of insight that
are most universal. It is thus that all things human are
happily brought within human sympathy. It was at the
heart of everything Dickens wrote. It was the secret
of the hope he had that his books might help to make
people better; and it so guarded them from evil, that
there is scarcely a page of the thousands he has written
which might not be put into the hands of a little child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_384" id="Page_3_384">[384]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
It made him the intimate of every English household,
and a familiar friend wherever the language is spoken
whose stores of harmless pleasure he has so largely increased.</p>

<p>"The loss of no single man during the present
generation, if we except Abraham Lincoln alone," said
Mr. Horace Greeley, describing the profound and
universal grief of America at his death, "has carried
mourning into so many families, and been so unaffectedly
lamented through all the ranks of society."
"The terrible news from England," wrote Longfellow
to me (Cambridge, Mass. 12th of June 1870), "fills us
all with inexpressible sadness. Dickens was so full of
life that it did not seem possible he could die, and yet
he has gone before us, and we are sorrowing for him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I never knew an author's death cause such general
mourning. It is no exaggeration to say that this whole
country is stricken with grief .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." Nor was evidence
then wanting, that far beyond the limits of society on
that vast continent the English writer's influence had
penetrated. Of this, very touching illustration was
given in my first volume; and proof even more striking
has since been afforded to me, that not merely in
wild or rude communities, but in life the most savage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_385" id="Page_3_385">[385]</a></span>
and solitary, his genius had helped to while time
away.</p>

<p>"Like all Americans who read," writes an American
gentleman, "and that takes in nearly all our people, I
am an admirer and student of Dickens.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Its perusal"
(that of my second volume) "has recalled an
incident which may interest you. Twelve or thirteen
years ago I crossed the Sierra Nevada mountains as a
Government surveyor under a famous frontiersman and
civil engineer&mdash;Colonel Lander. We were too early
by a month, and became snow-bound just on the very
summit. Under these circumstances it was necessary
to abandon the wagons for a time, and drive the stock
(mules) down the mountains to the valleys where there
was pasturage and running water. This was a long and
difficult task, occupying several days. On the second
day, in a spot where we expected to find nothing more
human than a grizzly bear or an elk, we found a little
hut, built of pine boughs and a few rough boards
clumsily hewn out of small trees with an axe. The hut
was covered with snow many feet deep, excepting only
the hole in the roof which served for a chimney, and a
small pit-like place in front to permit egress. The
occupant came forth to hail us and solicit whisky and
tobacco. He was dressed in a suit made entirely of
flour-sacks, and was curiously labelled on various parts
of his person <i>Best Family Flour</i>. <i>Extra.</i> His head was
covered by a wolf's skin drawn from the brute's head&mdash;with
the ears standing erect in a fierce alert manner.
He was a most extraordinary object, and told us he
had not seen a human being in four months. He lived
on bear and elk meat and flour laid in during his short<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_386" id="Page_3_386">[386]</a></span>
summer. Emigrants in the season paid him a kind of
ferry-toll. I asked him how he passed his time, and
he went to a barrel and produced <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>
and <i>Pickwick</i>. I found he knew them almost by heart.
He did not know, or seem to care, about the author;
but he gloried in Sam Weller, despised Squeers, and
would probably have taken the latter's scalp with great
skill and cheerfulness. For Mr. Winkle he had no
feeling but contempt, and in fact regarded a fowling-piece
as only a toy for a squaw. He had no Bible;
and perhaps if he practised in his rude savage way all
Dickens taught, he might less have felt the want even
of that companion."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the intention of this and the following chapter
to narrate the incidents of the visit to America
in Dickens's own language, and in that only. They
will consist almost exclusively of extracts from his
letters written home, to members of his family and to
myself.</p>

<p>On the night of Tuesday the 19th of November he
arrived at Boston, where he took up his residence at the
Parker House hotel; and his first letter (21st) stated
that the tickets for the first four Readings, all to that
time issued, had been sold immediately on their becoming
saleable. "An immense train of people waited
in the freezing street for twelve hours, and passed into
the office in their turns, as at a French theatre. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_388" id="Page_3_388">[388]</a></span>
receipts already taken for these nights exceed our calculation
by more than &pound;250." Up to the last moment,
he had not been able to clear off wholly a shade of
misgiving that some of the old grudges might make
themselves felt; but from the instant of his setting
foot in Boston not a vestige of such fear remained.
The greeting was to the full as extraordinary as that of
twenty-five years before, and was given now, as then,
to the man who had made himself the most popular
writer in the country. His novels and tales were
crowding the shelves of all the dealers in books in
all the cities of the Union. In every house, in every
car, on every steamboat, in every theatre of America,
the characters, the fancies, the phraseology of Dickens
were become familiar beyond those of any other writer
of books. "Even in England," said one of the New
York journals, "Dickens is less known than here; and
of the millions here who treasure every word he has
written, there are tens of thousands who would make a
large sacrifice to see and hear the man who has made
happy so many hours. Whatever sensitiveness there
once was to adverse or sneering criticism, the lapse of
a quarter of a century, and the profound significance
of a great war, have modified or removed." The
point was more pithily, and as truly, put by Mr.
Horace Greeley in the <i>Tribune</i>. "The fame as a
novelist which Mr. Dickens had already created in
America, and which, at the best, has never yielded
him anything particularly munificent or substantial, is
become his capital stock in the present enterprise."</p>

<p>The first Reading was appointed for the second of
December, and in the interval he saw some old friends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_389" id="Page_3_389">[389]</a></span>
and made some new ones.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Boston he was fond of
comparing to Edinburgh as Edinburgh was in the days
when several dear friends of his own still lived there.
Twenty-five years had changed much in the American
city; some genial faces were gone, and on ground
which he had left a swamp he found now the most
princely streets; but there was no abatement of the
old warmth of kindness, and, with every attention and
consideration shown to him, there was no intrusion.
He was not at first completely conscious of the change
in this respect, or of the prodigious increase in the size
of Boston. But the latter grew upon him from day
to day, and then there was impressed along with it a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_390" id="Page_3_390">[390]</a></span>
contrast to which it was difficult to reconcile himself.
Nothing enchanted him so much as what he again saw
of the delightful domestic life of Cambridge, simple,
self-respectful, cordial, and affectionate; and it seemed
impossible to believe that within half an hour's distance
of it should be found what might at any time be witnessed
in such hotels as that which he was staying at:
crowds of swaggerers, loafers, bar-loungers, and dram-drinkers,
that seemed to be making up, from day to
day, not the least important-part of the human life of
the city. But no great mercantile resort in the States,
such as Boston had now become, could be without that
drawback; and fortunate should we account any place
to be, though even so plague-afflicted, that has yet so
near it the healthier influence of the other life which
our older world has wellnigh lost altogether.</p>

<p>"The city has increased prodigiously in twenty-five
years," he wrote to his daughter Mary. "It has
grown more mercantile. It is like Leeds mixed with
Preston, and flavoured with New Brighton. Only,
instead of smoke and fog, there is an exquisitely
bright light air." "Cambridge is exactly as I left
it," he wrote to me. "Boston more mercantile, and
much larger. The hotel I formerly stayed at, and
thought a very big one, is now regarded as a very
small affair. I do not yet notice&mdash;but a day, you
know, is not a long time for observation!&mdash;any marked
change in character or habits. In this immense hotel
I live very high up, and have a hot and cold bath in
my bed room, with other comforts not in existence in
my former day. The cost of living is enormous."
"Two of the staff are at New York," he wrote to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_391" id="Page_3_391">[391]</a></span>
sister-in-law on the 25th of November, "where we are
at our wits' end how to keep tickets out of the hands
of speculators. We have communications from all
parts of the country, but we take no offer whatever.
The young under-graduates of Cambridge have made a
representation to Longfellow that they are 500 strong
and cannot get one ticket. I don't know what is to be
done, but I suppose I must read there, somehow. We
are all in the clouds until I shall have broken ground in
New York." The sale of tickets, there, had begun two
days before the first reading in Boston. "At the New
York barriers," he wrote to his daughter on the first
of December, "where the tickets were on sale and the
people ranged as at the Paris theatres, speculators went
up and down offering twenty dollars for any body's
place. The money was in no case accepted. But one
man sold two tickets for the second, third, and fourth
nights; his payment in exchange being one ticket for
the first night, fifty dollars (about &pound;7 10<i>s.</i>), and a
'brandy-cocktail.'"</p>

<p>On Monday the second of December he read for the
first time in Boston, his subjects being the <i>Carol</i> and
the <i>Trial from Pickwick;</i> and his reception, from an
audience than which perhaps none more remarkable
could have been brought together, went beyond all
expectations formed. "It is really impossible," he
wrote to me next morning, "to exaggerate the magnificence
of the reception or the effect of the reading.
The whole city will talk of nothing else and
hear of nothing else to-day. Every ticket for those
announced here, and in New York, is sold. All
are sold at the highest price, for which in our calculation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_392" id="Page_3_392">[392]</a></span>
we made no allowance; and it is impossible to
keep out speculators who immediately sell at a premium.
At the decreased rate of money even, we had
above &pound;450 English in the house last night; and the
New York hall holds 500 people more. Everything
looks brilliant beyond the most sanguine hopes, and I
was quite as cool last night as though I were reading at
Chatham." The next night he read again; and also on
Thursday and Friday; on Wednesday he had rested;
and on Saturday he travelled to New York.</p>

<p>He had written, the day before he left, that he was
making a clear profit of thirteen hundred pounds English
a week, even allowing seven dollars to the pound;
but words were added having no good omen in them,
that the weather was taking a turn of even unusual
severity, and that he found the climate, in the suddenness
of its changes, "and the wide leaps they take,"
excessively trying. "The work is of course rather
trying too; but the sound position that everything must
be subservient to it enables me to keep aloof from invitations.
To-morrow," ran the close of the letter, "we
move to New York. We cannot beat the speculators
in our tickets. We sell no more than six to any one
person for the course of four readings; but these speculators,
who sell at greatly increased prices and make
large profits, will employ any number of men to buy.
One of the chief of them&mdash;now living in this house,
in order that he may move as we move!&mdash;can put on
50 people in any place we go to; and thus he gets 300
tickets into his own hands." Almost while Dickens
was writing these words an eye-witness was describing
to a Philadelphia paper the sale of the New York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_393" id="Page_3_393">[393]</a></span>
tickets. The pay-place was to open at nine on a Wednesday
morning, and at midnight of Tuesday a long
line of speculators were assembled in <i>queue;</i> at two in
the morning a few honest buyers had begun to arrive;
at five there were, of all classes, two lines of not less
than 800 each; at eight there were at least 5000 persons
in the two lines; at nine each line was more than
three-quarters of a mile in length, and neither became
sensibly shorter during the whole morning. "The
tickets for the course were all sold before noon. Members
of families relieved each other in the <i>queues;</i>
waiters flew across the streets and squares from the
neighbouring restaurant, to serve parties who were
taking their breakfast in the open December air; while
excited men offered five and ten dollars for the mere
permission to exchange places with other persons
standing nearer the head of the line!"</p>

<p>The effect of the reading in New York corresponded
with this marvellous preparation, and Dickens characterised
his audience as an unexpected support to him;
in its appreciation quick and unfailing, and highly
demonstrative in its satisfactions. On the 11th of
December he wrote to his daughter: "Amazing success.
A very fine audience, far better than at Boston.
<i>Carol</i> and <i>Trial</i> on first night, great: still greater,
<i>Copperfield</i> and <i>Bob Sawyer</i> on second. For the tickets
of the four readings of next week there were, at nine
o'clock this morning, 3000 people in waiting, and they
had begun to assemble in the bitter cold as early as two
o'clock in the morning." To myself he wrote on the
15th, adding touches to the curious picture. "Dolby
has got into trouble about the manner of issuing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_394" id="Page_3_394">[394]</a></span>
tickets for next week's series. He cannot get four
thousand people into a room holding only two thousand,
he cannot induce people to pay at the ordinary
price for themselves instead of giving thrice as much
to speculators, and he is attacked in all directions . . .
I don't much like my hall, for it has two large balconies
far removed from the platform; but no one ever waylays
me as I go into it or come out of it, and it is kept
as rigidly quiet as the Fran&ccedil;ais at a rehearsal. We have
not yet had in it less than &pound;430 per night, allowing
for the depreciated currency! I send &pound;3000 to England
by this packet. From all parts of the States,
applications and offers continually come in. We go to
Boston next Saturday for two more readings, and come
back here on Christmas Day for four more. I am not
yet bound to go elsewhere, except three times (each
time for two nights) to Philadelphia; thinking it wisest
to keep free for the largest places. I have had an action
brought against me by a man who considered himself
injured (and really may have been) in the matter of his
tickets. Personal service being necessary, I was politely
waited on by a marshal for that purpose; whom I received
with the greatest courtesy, apparently very much
to his amazement. The action was handsomely withdrawn
next day, and the plaintiff paid his own costs.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Dolby hopes you are satisfied with the figures so
far; the profit each night exceeding the estimated
profit by &pound;130 odd. He is anxious I should also tell
you that he is the most unpopular and best-abused man
in America." Next day a letter to his sister-in-law
related an incident too common in American cities to
disconcert any but strangers. He had lodged himself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_395" id="Page_3_395">[395]</a></span>
I should have said, at the Westminster Hotel in Irving
Place. "Last night I was getting into bed just at 12
o'clock, when Dolby came to my door to inform me
that the house was on fire. I got Scott up directly;
told him first to pack the books and clothes for the
Readings; dressed, and pocketed my jewels and papers;
while the manager stuffed himself out with money.
Meanwhile the police and firemen were in the house
tracing the mischief to its source in a certain fire-grate.
By this time the hose was laid all through from a great
tank on the roof, and everybody turned out to help.
It was the oddest sight, and people had put the
strangest things on! After chopping and cutting with
axes through stairs, and much handing about of water,
the fire was confined to a dining-room in which it had
originated; and then everybody talked to everybody
else, the ladies being particularly loquacious and cheerful.
I may remark that the second landlord (from
both, but especially the first, I have had untiring attention)
no sooner saw me on this agitating occasion,
than, with his property blazing, he insisted on taking
me down into a room full of hot smoke, to drink
brandy and water with him! And so we got to bed
again about 2."</p>

<p>Dickens had been a week in New York before he
was able to identify the great city which a lapse of
twenty-five years had so prodigiously increased. "The
only portion that has even now come back to me," he
wrote, "is the part of Broadway in which the Carlton
Hotel (long since destroyed) used to stand. There is
a very fine new park in the outskirts, and the number
of grand houses and splendid equipages is quite surprising.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_396" id="Page_3_396">[396]</a></span>
There are hotels close here with 500 bedrooms
and I don't know how many boarders; but this
hotel is quite as quiet as, and not much larger than,
Mivart's in Brook Street. My rooms are all en suite,
and I come and go by a private door and private staircase
communicating with my bed-room. The waiters
are French, and one might be living in Paris. One
of the two proprietors is also proprietor of Niblo's
Theatre, and the greatest care is taken of me. Niblo's
great attraction, the <i>Black Crook</i>, has now been played
every night for 16 months(!), and is the most preposterous
peg to hang ballets on that was ever seen.
The people who act in it have not the slightest idea of
what it is about, and never had; but, after taxing my
intellectual powers to the utmost, I fancy that I have
discovered Black Crook to be a malignant hunchback
leagued with the Powers of Darkness to separate two
lovers; and that the Powers of Lightness coming (in
no skirts whatever) to the rescue, he is defeated. I
am quite serious in saying that I do not suppose there
are two pages of <i>All the Year Round</i> in the whole piece
(which acts all night); the whole of the rest of it being
ballets of all sorts, perfectly unaccountable processions,
and the Donkey out of last year's Covent Garden pantomime!
At the other theatres, comic operas, melodramas,
and domestic dramas prevail all over the city,
and my stories play no inconsiderable part in them. I
go nowhere, having laid down the rule that to combine
visiting with my work would be absolutely impossible.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The Fenian explosion at Clerkenwell was telegraphed
here in a few hours. I do not think there is
any sympathy whatever with the Fenians on the part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_397" id="Page_3_397">[397]</a></span>
of the American people, though political adventurers
may make capital out of a show of it. But no doubt
large sections of the Irish population of this State
are themselves Fenian; and the local politics of the
place are in a most depraved condition, if half of
what is said to me be true. I prefer not to talk of
these things, but at odd intervals I look round for
myself. Great social improvements in respect of manners
and forbearance have come to pass since I was
here before, but in public life I see as yet but little
change."</p>

<p>He had got through half of his first New York readings
when a winter storm came on, and from this time
until very near his return the severity of the weather
was exceptional even for America. When the first
snow fell, the railways were closed for some days; and
he described New York crowded with sleighs, and the
snow piled up in enormous walls the whole length of
the streets. "I turned out in a rather gorgeous sleigh
yesterday with any quantity of buffalo robes, and made
an imposing appearance." "If you were to behold
me driving out," he wrote to his daughter, "furred up
to the moustache, with an immense white red-and-yellow-striped
rug for a covering, you would suppose me
to be of Hungarian or Polish nationality." These
protections nevertheless availed him little; and when
the time came for getting back to Boston, he found
himself at the close of his journey with a cold and
cough that never again left him until he had quitted
the country, and of which the effects became more and
more disastrous. For the present there was little allusion
to this, his belief at the first being strong that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_398" id="Page_3_398">[398]</a></span>
should overmaster it; but it soon forced itself into all
his letters.</p>

<p>His railway journey otherwise had not been agreeable.
"The railways are truly alarming. Much worse
(because more worn I suppose) than when I was here
before. We were beaten about yesterday, as if we had
been aboard the Cuba. Two rivers have to be crossed,
and each time the whole train is banged aboard a big
steamer. The steamer rises and falls with the river,
which the railroad don't do; and the train is either
banged up hill or banged down hill. In coming off
the steamer at one of these crossings yesterday, we
were banged up such a height that the rope broke, and
one carriage rushed back with a run down-hill into the
boat again. I whisked out in a moment, and two or
three others after me; but nobody else seemed to care
about it. The treatment of the luggage is perfectly
outrageous. Nearly every case I have is already broken.
When we started from Boston yesterday, I beheld, to
my unspeakable amazement, Scott, my dresser, leaning
a flushed countenance against the wall of the car, and
<i>weeping bitterly</i>. It was over my smashed writing-desk.
Yet the arrangements for luggage are excellent, if the
porters would not be beyond description reckless."
The same excellence of provision, and flinging away
of its advantages, are observed in connection with
another subject in the same letter. "The halls are
excellent. Imagine one holding two thousand people,
seated with exact equality for every one of them,
and every one seated separately. I have nowhere, at
home or abroad, seen so fine a police as the police of
New York; and their bearing in the streets is above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_399" id="Page_3_399">[399]</a></span>
all praise. On the other hand, the laws for regulation
of public vehicles, clearing of streets, and removal of
obstructions, are wildly outraged by the people for
whose benefit they are intended. Yet there is undoubtedly
improvement in every direction, and I am
taking time to make up my mind on things in general.
Let me add that I have been tempted out at three in
the morning to visit one of the large police station-houses,
and was so fascinated by the study of a horrible
photograph-book of thieves' portraits that I couldn't
shut it up."</p>

<p>A letter of the same date (22nd) to his sister-in-law
told of personal attentions awaiting him on his return
to Boston by which he was greatly touched. He found
his rooms garnished with flowers and holly, with real
red berries, and with festoons of moss; and the homely
Christmas look of the place quite affected him. "There
is a certain Captain Dolliver belonging to the Boston
custom-house, who came off in the little steamer that
brought me ashore from the Cuba; and he took it into
his head that he would have a piece of English mistletoe
brought out in this week's Cunard, which should be
laid upon my breakfast-table. And there it was this
morning. In such affectionate touches as this, these
New England people are especially amiable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As a
general rule you may lay it down that whatever you
see about me in the papers is not true; but you may
generally lend a more believing ear to the Philadelphia
correspondent of the <i>Times</i>, a well-informed gentleman.
Our hotel in New York was on fire again the other
night. But fires in this country are quite matters of
course. There was a large one in Boston at four this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_400" id="Page_3_400">[400]</a></span>
morning; and I don't think a single night has passed,
since I have been under the protection of the Eagle,
that I have not heard the Fire Bells dolefully clanging
all over both cities." The violent abuse of his manager
by portions of the press is the subject of the rest
of the letter, and receives farther illustration in one of
the same date to me. "A good specimen of the sort
of newspaper you and I know something of, came out
in Boston here this morning. The editor had applied
for our advertisements, saying that 'it was at Mr. D's
disposal for paragraphs.' The advertisements were not
sent; Dolby did not enrich its columns paragraphically;
and among its news to-day is the item that 'this chap
calling himself Dolby got drunk down town last night,
and was taken to the police station for fighting an
Irishman!' I am sorry to say that I don't find anybody
to be much shocked by this liveliness." It is
right to add what was said to me a few days later.
"The <i>Tribune</i> is an excellent paper. Horace Greeley
is editor in chief, and a considerable shareholder too.
All the people connected with it whom I have seen are
of the best class. It is also, a very fine property&mdash;but
here the <i>New York Herald</i> beats it hollow, hollow,
hollow! Another able and well edited paper is the
<i>New York Times</i>. A most respectable journal too is
Bryant's <i>Evening Post</i>, excellently written. There is
generally a much more responsible and respectable
tone than prevailed formerly, however small may be
the literary merit, among papers pointed out to me as
of large circulation. In much of the writing there is
certainly improvement, but it might be more widely
spread."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_401" id="Page_3_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p>The time had now come when the course his Readings
were to take independently of the two leading
cities must be settled, and the general tour made out.
His agent's original plan was that they should be in
New York every week. "But I say No. By the 10th
of January I shall have read to 35,000 people in that
city alone. Put the readings out of the reach of all
the people behind them, for the time. It is that one
of the popular peculiarities which I most particularly
notice, that they must not have a thing too easily.
Nothing in the country lasts long; and a thing is prized
the more, the less easy it is made. Reflecting therefore
that I shall want to close, in April, with farewell
readings here and in New York, I am convinced that
the crush and pressure upon these necessary to their
adequate success is only to be got by absence; and
that the best thing I can do is not to give either city
as much reading as it wants now, but to be independent
of both while both are most enthusiastic. I have therefore
resolved presently to announce in New York so
many readings (I mean a certain number) as the last
that can be given there, before I travel to promised
places; and that we select the best places, with the
largest halls, on our list. This will include, East here&mdash;the
two or three best New England towns; South&mdash;Baltimore
and Washington; West&mdash;Cincinnati, Pittsburgh,
Chicago, and St. Louis; and towards Niagara&mdash;Cleveland
and Buffalo. Philadelphia we are already
pledged to, for six nights; and the scheme will pretty
easily bring us here again twice before the farewells. I
feel convinced that this is the sound policy." (It was
afterwards a little modified, as will be seen, by public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_402" id="Page_3_402">[402]</a></span>
occurrences and his own condition of health; the West,
as well as a promise to Canada, having to be abandoned;
but otherwise it was carried out.) "I read
here to-morrow and Tuesday; all tickets being sold to
the end of the series, even for subjects not announced.
I have not read a single time at a lower clear profit per
night (all deductions made) than &pound;315. But rely upon
it I shall take great care not to read oftener than four
times a week&mdash;after this next week, when I stand committed
to five. The inevitable tendency of the staff,
when these great houses excite them, is, in the words
of an old friend of ours, to 'hurge the hartist hon;'
and a night or two ago I had to cut away five readings
from <i>their</i> list."</p>

<p>An incident at Boston should have mention before
he resumes his readings in New York. In the interval
since he was first in America, the Harvard professor of
chemistry, Dr. Webster, whom he had at that visit met
among the honoured men who held chairs in their
Cambridge University, had been hanged for the murder,
committed in his laboratory in the college, of a
friend who had lent him money, portions of whose body
lay concealed under the lid of the lecture-room table
where the murderer continued to meet his students.
"Being in Cambridge," Dickens wrote to Lord Lytton,
"I thought I would go over the Medical School, and
see the exact localities where Professor Webster did
that amazing murder, and worked so hard to rid himself
of the body of the murdered man. (I find there
is of course no rational doubt that the Professor was
always a secretly cruel man.) They were horribly grim,
private, cold, and quiet; the identical furnace smelling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_403" id="Page_3_403">[403]</a></span>
fearfully (some anatomical broth in it I suppose) as if
the body were still there; jars of pieces of sour mortality
standing about, like the forty robbers in <i>Ali Baba</i>
after being scalded to death; and bodies near us ready
to be carried in to next morning's lecture. At the
house where I afterwards dined I heard an amazing and
fearful story; told by one who had been at a dinner-party
of ten or a dozen, at Webster's, less than a year
before the murder. They began rather uncomfortably,
in consequence of one of the guests (the victim of an
instinctive antipathy) starting up with the sweat pouring
down his face, and crying out, 'O Heaven! There's
a cat somewhere in the room!' The cat was found and
ejected, but they didn't get on very well. Left with
their wine, they were getting on a little better; when
Webster suddenly told the servants to turn the gas off
and bring in that bowl of burning minerals which he
had prepared, in order that the company might see how
ghastly they looked by its weird light. All this was
done, and every man was looking, horror-stricken, at
his neighbour; when Webster was seen bending over
the bowl with a rope round his neck, holding up the
end of the rope, with his head on one side and his
tongue lolled out, to represent a hanged man!"</p>

<p>Dickens read at Boston on the 23rd and the 24th of
December, and on Christmas day travelled back to New
York where he was to read on the 26th. The last words
written before he left were of illness. "The low action
of the heart, or whatever it is, has inconvenienced me
greatly this last week. On Monday night, after the
reading, I was laid upon a bed, in a very faint and
shady state; and on the Tuesday I did not get up till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_404" id="Page_3_404">[404]</a></span>
the afternoon." But what in reality was less grave
took outwardly the form of a greater distress; and the
effects of the cold which had struck him in travelling
to Boston, as yet not known to his English friends,
appear most to have alarmed those about him. I depart
from my rule in this narrative, otherwise strictly observed,
in singling out one of those friends for mention
by name: but a business connection with the Readings,
as well as untiring offices of personal kindness and
sympathy, threw Mr. Fields into closer relations with
Dickens from arrival to departure, than any other person
had; and his description of the condition of health
in which Dickens now quitted Boston and went through
the rest of the labour he had undertaken, will be a sad
though fit prelude to what the following chapter has to
tell. "He went from Boston to New York carrying
with him a severe catarrh contracted in our climate.
He was quite ill from the effects of the disease; but he
fought courageously against them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His spirit was
wonderful, and, although he lost all appetite and could
partake of very little food, he was always cheerful and
ready for his work when the evening came round. A
dinner was tendered to him by some of his literary
friends in Boston; but he was so ill the day before that
the banquet had to be given up. The strain upon his
strength and nerves was very great during all the months
he remained, and only a man of iron will could have
accomplished what he did. He was accustomed to talk
and write a good deal about eating and drinking, but I
have rarely seen a man eat and drink less. He liked
to dilate in imagination over the brewing of a bowl of
punch, but when the punch was ready he drank less of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_405" id="Page_3_405">[405]</a></span>
it than any one who might be present. It was the
sentiment of the thing and not the thing itself that
engaged his attention. I scarcely saw him eat a hearty
meal during his whole stay. Both at Parker's hotel in
Boston, and at the Westminster in New York, everything
was arranged by the proprietors for his comfort,
and tempting dishes to pique his invalid appetite were
sent up at different hours of the day; but the influenza
had seized him with masterful power, and held the
strong man down till he left the country."</p>

<p>When he arrived in New York on the evening of
Christmas Day he found a letter from his daughter.
Answering her next day he told her: "I wanted it
much, for I had a frightful cold (English colds are
nothing to those of this country) and was very miserable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It is a bad country to be unwell and travelling
in. You are one of, say, a hundred people in a heated
car with a great stove in it, all the little windows being
closed; and the bumping and banging about are indescribable,
the atmosphere detestable, the ordinary
motion all but intolerable." The following day this
addition was made to the letter. "I managed to read
last night, but it was as much as I could do. To-day I
am so very unwell that I have sent for a doctor. He has
just been, and is in doubt whether I shall not have to
stop reading for a while."</p>

<p>His stronger will prevailed, and he went on without
stopping. On the last day of the year he announced
to us that though he had been very low he was getting
right again; that in a couple of days he should have
accomplished a fourth of the entire Readings; and that
the first month of the new year would see him through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_406" id="Page_3_406">[406]</a></span>
Philadelphia and Baltimore, as well as through two
more nights in Boston. He also prepared his English
friends for the startling intelligence they might shortly
expect, of four readings coming off in a church, before
an audience of two thousand people accommodated in
pews, and with himself emerging from a vestry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Reading on the third of January closed a fourth
of the entire series, and on that day Dickens wrote of
the trouble brought on them by the "speculators,"
which to some extent had affected unfavourably the
three previous nights in New York. When adventurers
buy up the best places, the public resent it by refusing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_408" id="Page_3_408">[408]</a></span>
worst; to prevent it by first helping themselves, being
the last thing they ever think of doing. "We try to
withhold the best seats from the speculators, but the
unaccountable thing is that the great mass of the public
buy of them (prefer it), and the rest of the public are
injured if we have not got those very seats to sell them.
We have now a travelling staff of six men, in spite of
which Dolby, who is leaving me to-day to sell tickets
in Philadelphia to-morrow morning, will no doubt get
into a tempest of difficulties. Of course also, in such
a matter, as many obstacles as possible are thrown in
an Englishman's way; and he may himself be a little
injudicious into the bargain. Last night, for instance,
he met one of the 'ushers' (who show people to their
seats) coming in with one of our men. It is against
orders that any one employed in front should go out
during the reading, and he took this man to task in
the British manner. Instantly, the free and independent
usher put on his hat and walked off. Seeing
which, all the other free and independent ushers (some
20 in number) put on <i>their</i> hats and walked off; leaving
us absolutely devoid and destitute of a staff for to-night.
One has since been improvised: but it was a small
matter to raise a stir and ill-will about, especially as
one of our men was equally in fault; and really there
is little to be done at night. American people are so
accustomed to take care of themselves, that one of these
immense audiences will fall into their places with an
ease amazing to a frequenter of St. James's Hall; and
the certainty with which they are all in, before I go on,
is a very acceptable mark of respect. Our great labour
is outside; and we have been obliged to bring our staff<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_409" id="Page_3_409">[409]</a></span>
up to six, besides a boy or two, by employment of a
regular additional clerk, a Bostonian. The speculators
buying the front-seats (we have found instances of this
being done by merchants in good position), the public
won't have the back seats; return their tickets; write
and print volumes on the subject; and deter others from
coming. You are not to suppose that this prevails to
any great extent, as our lowest house here has been
&pound;300; but it does hit us. There is no doubt about it.
Fortunately I saw the danger when the trouble began,
and changed the list at the right time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You may
get an idea of the staff's work, by what is in hand now.
They are preparing, numbering, and stamping, 6000
tickets for Philadelphia, and 8000 tickets for Brooklyn.
The moment those are done, another 8000 tickets will
be wanted for Baltimore, and probably another 6000
for Washington; and all this in addition to the correspondence,
advertisements, accounts, travelling, and the
nightly business of the Readings four times a week.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I cannot get rid of this intolerable cold! My
landlord invented for me a drink of brandy, rum, and
snow, called it a 'Rocky Mountain Sneezer,' and said
it was to put down all less effectual sneezing; but it has
not yet had the effect. Did I tell you that the favourite
drink before you get up is an Eye-Opener? There
has been another fall of snow, succeeded by a heavy
thaw."</p>

<p>The day after (the 4th) he went back to Boston, and
next day wrote to me: "I am to read here on Monday
and Tuesday, return to New York on Wednesday, and
finish there (except the farewells in April) on Thursday
and Friday. The New York reading of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_410" id="Page_3_410">[410]</a></span> <i>Doctor Marigold</i>
made really a tremendous hit. The people doubted
at first, having evidently not the least idea what could
be done with it, and broke out at last into a perfect
chorus of delight. At the end they made a great shout,
and gave a rush towards the platform as if they were
going to carry me off. It puts a strong additional arrow
into my quiver. Another extraordinary success
has been <i>Nickleby</i> and <i>Boots at the Holly Tree</i> (appreciated
here in Boston, by the bye, even more than
<i>Copperfield</i>); and think of our last New York night
bringing &pound;500 English into the house, after making
more than the necessary deduction for the present price
of gold! The manager is always going about with an
immense bundle that looks like a sofa-cushion, but is in
reality paper-money, and it had risen to the proportions
of a sofa on the morning he left for Philadelphia. Well,
the work is hard, the climate is hard, the life is hard:
but so far the gain is enormous. My cold steadily refuses
to stir an inch. It distresses me greatly at times,
though it is always good enough to leave me for the
needful two hours. I have tried allopathy, hom&#339;opathy,
cold things, warm things, sweet things, bitter
things, stimulants, narcotics, all with the same result.
Nothing will touch it."</p>

<p>In the same letter, light was thrown on the ecclesiastical
mystery. "At Brooklyn I am going to read in
Mr. Ward Beecher's chapel: the only building there
available for the purpose. You must understand that
Brooklyn is a kind of sleeping-place for New York,
and is supposed to be a great place in the money way.
We let the seats pew by pew! the pulpit is taken down
for my screen and gas! and I appear out of the vestry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_411" id="Page_3_411">[411]</a></span>
in canonical form! These ecclesiastical entertainments
come off on the evenings of the 16th, 17th, 20th, and
21st, of the present month." His first letter after returning
to New York (9th of January) made additions
to the Brooklyn picture. "Each evening an enormous
ferry-boat will convey me and my state-carriage (not to
mention half a dozen wagons and any number of people
and a few score of horses) across the river to Brooklyn,
and will bring me back again. The sale of tickets there
was an amazing scene. The noble army of speculators
are now furnished (this is literally true, and I am quite
serious) each man with a straw mattress, a little bag of
bread and meat, two blankets, and a bottle of whiskey.
With this outfit, <i>they lie down in line on the pavement</i>
the whole of the night before the tickets are sold: generally
taking up their position at about 10. It being
severely cold at Brooklyn, they made an immense bonfire
in the street&mdash;a narrow street of wooden houses&mdash;which
the police turned out to extinguish. A general
fight then took place; from which the people farthest
off in the line rushed bleeding when they saw any
chance of ousting others nearer the door, put their
mattresses in the spots so gained, and held on by the
iron rails. At 8 in the morning Dolby appeared with
the tickets in a portmanteau. He was immediately
saluted with a roar of Halloa! Dolby! So Charley has
let you have the carriage, has he, Dolby? How is he,
Dolby? Don't drop the tickets, Dolby! Look alive,
Dolby! &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. in the midst of which he proceeded
to business, and concluded (as usual) by giving
universal dissatisfaction. He is now going off upon a
little journey to look over the ground and cut back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_412" id="Page_3_412">[412]</a></span>
again. This little journey (to Chicago) is twelve hundred
miles on end, by railway, besides the back again!"
It might tax the Englishman, but was nothing to the
native American. It was part of his New York landlord's
ordinary life in a week, Dickens told me, to go
to Chicago and look at his theatre there on a Monday;
to pelt back to Boston and look at his theatre there on
a Thursday; and to come rushing to New York on a
Friday, to apostrophize his enormous ballet.</p>

<p>Three days later, still at New York, he wrote to his
sister-in-law. "I am off to Philadelphia this evening
for the first of three visits of two nights each, tickets
for all being sold. My cold steadily refuses to leave
me, but otherwise I am as well as I can hope to be under
this heavy work. My New York readings are over
(except the farewell nights), and I look forward to the
relief of being out of my hardest hall. On Friday I
was again dead beat at the end, and was once more laid
upon a sofa. But the faintness went off after a little
while. We have now cold bright frosty weather, without
snow; the best weather for me." Next day from
Philadelphia he wrote to his daughter that he was
lodged in The Continental, one of the most immense
of American hotels, but that he found himself just as
quiet as elsewhere. "Everything is very good, my
waiter is German, and the greater part of the servants
seem to be coloured people. The town is very clean,
and the day as blue and bright as a fine Italian day.
But it freezes very very hard, and my cold is not improved;
for the cars were so intolerably hot that I was
often obliged to stand upon the brake outside, and then
the frosty air bit me indeed. I find it necessary (so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_413" id="Page_3_413">[413]</a></span>
oppressed am I with this American catarrh as they call
it) to dine at three o'clock instead of four, that I may
have more time to get voice; so that the days are cut
short and letter-writing not easy."</p>

<p>He nevertheless found time in this city to write to
me (14th of January) the most interesting mention he
had yet made of such opinions as he had been able to
form during his present visit, apart from the pursuit
that absorbed him. Of such of those opinions as were
given on a former page, it is only necessary to repeat
that while the tone of party politics still impressed
him unfavourably, he had thus far seen everywhere
great changes for the better socially. I will add other
points from the same letter. That he was unfortunate
in his time of visiting New York, as far as its politics
were concerned, what has since happened conclusively
shows. "The Irish element is acquiring such enormous
influence in New York city, that when I think of it, and
see the large Roman Catholic cathedral rising there,
it seems unfair to stigmatise as 'American' other monstrous
things that one also sees. But the general corruption
in respect of the local funds appears to be
stupendous, and there is an alarming thing as to some
of the courts of law which I am afraid is native-born.
A case came under my notice the other day in which
it was perfectly plain, from what was said to me by a
person interested in resisting an injunction, that his
first proceeding had been to 'look up the Judge.'"
Of such occasional provincial oddity, harmless in itself
but strange in large cities, as he noticed in the sort of
half disappointment at the small fuss made by himself
about the Readings, and in the newspaper references to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_414" id="Page_3_414">[414]</a></span>
"Mr. Dickens's extraordinary composure" on the
platform, he gives an illustration. "Last night here
in Philadelphia (my first night), a very impressible and
responsive audience were so astounded by my simply
walking in and opening my book that I wondered what
was the matter. They evidently thought that there
ought to have been a flourish, and Dolby sent in to
prepare for me. With them it is the simplicity of the
operation that raises wonder. With the newspapers
'Mr. Dickens's extraordinary composure' is not reasoned
out as being necessary to the art of the thing,
but is sensitively watched with a lurking doubt whether
it may not imply disparagement of the audience. Both
these things strike me as drolly expressive."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>His testimony as to improved social habits and ways
was expressed very decidedly. "I think it reasonable
to expect that as I go westward, I shall find the old
manners going on before me, and may tread upon their
skirts mayhap. But so far, I have had no more intrusion
or boredom than I have when I lead the same life
in England. I write this in an immense hotel, but I
am as much at peace in my own rooms, and am left as
wholly undisturbed, as if I were at the Station Hotel
in York. I have now read in New York city to 40,000
people, and am quite as well known in the streets there
as I am in London. People will turn back, turn again
and face me, and have a look at me, or will say to one
another 'Look here! Dickens coming!' But no one
ever stops me or addresses me. Sitting reading in the
carriage outside the New York post-office while one of
the staff was stamping the letters inside, I became conscious
that a few people who had been looking at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_415" id="Page_3_415">[415]</a></span>
turn-out had discovered me within. On my peeping
out good-humouredly, one of them (I should say a merchant's
book-keeper) stepped up to the door, took off
his hat, and said in a frank way: 'Mr. Dickens, I should
very much like to have the honour of shaking hands
with you'&mdash;and, that done, presented two others.
Nothing could be more quiet or less intrusive. In the
railway cars, if I see anybody who clearly wants to
speak to me, I usually anticipate the wish by speaking
myself. If I am standing on the brake outside (to
avoid the intolerable stove), people getting down will
say with a smile: 'As I am taking my departure, Mr.
Dickens, and can't trouble you for more than a moment,
I should like to take you by the hand sir.' And so
we shake hands and go our ways.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of course many
of my impressions come through the readings. Thus
I find the people lighter and more humorous than
formerly; and there must be a great deal of innocent
imagination among every class, or they never could pet
with such extraordinary pleasure as they do, the Boots'
story of the elopement of the two little children. They
seem to see the children; and the women set up a
shrill undercurrent of half-pity and half-pleasure that
is quite affecting. To-night's reading is my 26th; but
as all the Philadelphia tickets for four more are sold,
as well as four at Brooklyn, you must assume that I am
at&mdash;say&mdash;my 35th reading. I have remitted to Coutts's
in English gold &pound;10,000 odd; and I roughly calculate
that on this number Dolby will have another thousand
pounds profit to pay me. These figures are of
course between ourselves, at present; but are they
not magnificent? The expenses, always recollect, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_416" id="Page_3_416">[416]</a></span>
enormous. On the other hand we never have occasion
to print a bill of any sort (bill-printing and posting
are great charges at home); and have just now sold
off &pound;90 worth of bill-paper, provided beforehand, as a
wholly useless incumbrance."</p>

<p>Then came, as ever, the constant shadow that still
attended him, the slave in the chariot of his triumph.
"The work is very severe. There is now no chance of
my being rid of this American catarrh until I embark for
England. It is very distressing. It likewise happens,
not seldom, that I am so dead beat when I come off
that they lay me down on a sofa after I have been
washed and dressed, and I lie there, extremely faint,
for a quarter of an hour. In that time I rally and come
right." One week later from New York, where he
had become due on the 16th for the first of his four
Brooklyn readings, he wrote to his sister-in-law. "My
cold sticks to me, and I can scarcely exaggerate what
I undergo from sleeplessness. I rarely take any breakfast
but an egg and a cup of tea&mdash;not even toast or
bread and butter. My small dinner at 3, and a little
quail or some such light thing when I come home at
night, is my daily fare; and at the hall I have established
the custom of taking an egg beaten up in sherry
before going in, and another between the parts, which
I think pulls me up.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is snowing hard now, and I
begin to move to-morrow. There is so much floating
ice in the river, that we are obliged to have a pretty
wide margin of time for getting over the ferry to read."
The last of the readings over the ferry was on the day
when this letter was written. "I finished at my church
to-night. It is Mrs. Stowe's brother's, and a most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_417" id="Page_3_417">[417]</a></span>
wonderful place to speak in. We had it enormously
full last night (<i>Marigold</i> and <i>Trial</i>), but it scarcely required
an effort. Mr. Ward Beecher being present in
his pew, I sent to invite him to come round before he
left. I found him to be an unostentatious, evidently
able, straightforward, and agreeable man; extremely
well-informed, and with a good knowledge of art."</p>

<p>Baltimore and Washington were the cities in which
he was now, on quitting New York, to read for the
first time; and as to the latter some doubts arose. The
exceptional course had been taken in regard to it, of
selecting a hall with space for not more than 700 and
charging everybody five dollars; to which Dickens, at
first greatly opposed, had yielded upon use of the argument,
"you have more people at New York, thanks to
the speculators, paying more than five dollars every
night." But now other suggestions came. "Horace
Greeley dined with me last Saturday," he wrote on
the 20th, "and didn't like my going to Washington,
now full of the greatest rowdies and worst kind of
people in the States. Last night at eleven came B. expressing
like doubts; and though they may be absurd
I thought them worth attention, B. coming so close on
Greeley." Mr. Dolby was in consequence sent express
to Washington with power to withdraw or go on,
as enquiry on the spot might dictate; and Dickens
took the additional resolve so far to modify the last
arrangements of his tour as to avoid the distances of
Chicago, St. Louis, and Cincinnati, to content himself
with smaller places and profits, and thereby to get
home nearly a month earlier. He was at Philadelphia
on the 23rd of January, when he announced this intention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_418" id="Page_3_418">[418]</a></span>
"The worst of it is, that everybody one advises
with has a monomania respecting Chicago. 'Good
heavens sir,' the great Philadelphia authority said to
me this morning, 'if you don't read in Chicago the
people will go into fits!' Well, I answered, I would
rather they went into fits than I did. But he didn't
seem to see it at all."</p>

<p>From Baltimore he wrote to his sister-in-law on the
29th, in the hour's interval he had to spare before going
back to Philadelphia. "It has been snowing hard for
four and twenty hours&mdash;though this place is as far south
as Valentia in Spain; and my manager, being on his
way to New York, has a good chance of being snowed
up somewhere. This is one of the places where Butler
carried it with a high hand during the war, and where
the ladies used to spit when they passed a Northern
soldier. They are very handsome women, with an
Eastern touch in them, and dress brilliantly. I have
rarely seen so many fine faces in an audience. They
are a bright responsive people likewise, and very pleasant
to read to. My hall is a charming little opera
house built by a society of Germans; quite a delightful
place for the purpose. I stand on the stage, with the
drop curtain down, and my screen before it. The
whole scene is very pretty and complete, and the audience
have a 'ring' in them that sounds deeper than the
ear. I go from here to Philadelphia, to read to-morrow
night and Friday; come through here again on
Saturday on my way back to Washington; come back
here on Saturday week for two finishing nights; then
go to Philadelphia for two farewells&mdash;and so turn my
back on the southern part of the country. Our new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_419" id="Page_3_419">[419]</a></span>
plan will give 82 readings in all." (The real number
was 76, six having been dropped on subsequent political
excitements.) "Of course I afterwards discovered
that we had finally settled the list on a Friday. I shall
be halfway through it at Washington; of course on a
Friday also, and my birthday." To myself he wrote
on the following day from Philadelphia, beginning
with a thank Heaven that he had struck off Canada and
the West, for he found the wear and tear "enormous."
"Dolby decided that the croakers were wrong about
Washington, and went on; the rather as his raised
prices, which he put finally at three dollars each, gave
satisfaction. Fields is so confident about Boston, that
my remaining list includes, in all, 14 more readings
there. I don't know how many more we might not
have had here (where I have had attentions otherwise
that have been very grateful to me), if we had chosen.
Tickets are now being resold at ten dollars each. At
Baltimore I had a charming little theatre, and a very apprehensive
impulsive audience. It is remarkable to see
how the Ghost of Slavery haunts the town; and how
the shambling, untidy, evasive, and postponing Irrepressible
proceeds about his free work, going round
and round it, instead of at it. The melancholy absurdity
of giving these people votes, at any rate at
present, would glare at one out of every roll of their
eyes, chuckle in their mouths, and bump in their heads,
if one did not see (as one cannot help seeing in the
country) that their enfranchisement is a mere party
trick to get votes. Being at the Penitentiary the other
day (this, while we mention votes), and looking over
the books, I noticed that almost every man had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_420" id="Page_3_420">[420]</a></span>
'pardoned' a day or two before his time was up. Why?
Because, if he had served his time out, he would have
been <i>ipso facto</i> disfranchised. So, this form of pardon
is gone through to save his vote; and as every officer
of the prison holds his place only in right of his party,
of course his hopeful clients vote for the party that has
let them out! When I read in Mr. Beecher's church
at Brooklyn, we found the trustees had suppressed the
fact that a certain upper gallery holding 150 was 'the
Coloured Gallery,' On the first night not a soul could
be induced to enter it; and it was not until it became
known next day that I was certainly not going to read
there more than four times, that we managed to fill it.
One night at New York, on our second or third row,
there were two well-dressed women with a tinge of
colour&mdash;I should say, not even quadroons. But the
holder of one ticket who found his seat to be next
them, demanded of Dolby 'what he meant by fixing
him next to those two Gord darmed cusses of niggers?'
and insisted on being supplied with another good
place. Dolby firmly replied that he was perfectly certain
Mr. Dickens would not recognize such an objection
on any account, but he could have his money back, if
he chose. Which, after some squabbling, he had. In
a comic scene in the New York Circus one night, when
I was looking on, four white people sat down upon a
form in a barber's shop to be shaved. A coloured man
came as the fifth customer, and the four immediately
ran away. This was much laughed at and applauded.
In the Baltimore Penitentiary, the white prisoners dine
on one side of the room, the coloured prisoners on the
other; and no one has the slightest idea of mixing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_421" id="Page_3_421">[421]</a></span>
them. But it is indubitably the fact that exhalations
not the most agreeable arise from a number of coloured
people got together, and I was obliged to beat a quick
retreat from their dormitory. I strongly believe that
they will die out of this country fast. It seems, looking
at them, so manifestly absurd to suppose it possible
that they can ever hold their own against a restless,
shifty, striving, stronger race."</p>

<p>On the fourth of February he wrote from Washington.
"You may like to have a line to let you know
that it is all right here, and that the croakers were
simply ridiculous. I began last night. A charming
audience, no dissatisfaction whatever at the raised
prices, nothing missed or lost, cheers at the end of the
<i>Carol</i>, and rounds upon rounds of applause all through.
All the foremost men and their families had taken
tickets for the series of four. A small place to read in.
&pound;300 in it." It will be no violation of the rule of
avoiding private detail if the very interesting close of
this letter is given. Its anecdote of President Lincoln
was repeatedly told by Dickens after his return, and I
am under no necessity to withhold from it the authority
of Mr. Sumner's name. "I am going to-morrow to
see the President, who has sent to me twice. I dined
with Charles Sumner last Sunday, against my rule; and
as I had stipulated for no party, Mr. Secretary Stanton
was the only other guest, besides his own secretary.
Stanton is a man with a very remarkable memory, and
extraordinarily familiar with my books.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He and
Sumner having been the first two public men at the
dying President's bedside, and having remained with
him until he breathed his last, we fell into a very interesting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_422" id="Page_3_422">[422]</a></span>
conversation after dinner, when, each of them
giving his own narrative separately, the usual discrepancies
about details of time were observable. Then
Mr. Stanton told me a curious little story which will
form the remainder of this short letter.</p>

<p>"On the afternoon of the day on which the President
was shot, there was a cabinet council at which he presided.
Mr. Stanton, being at the time commander-in-chief
of the Northern troops that were concentrated
about here, arrived rather late. Indeed they were
waiting for him, and on his entering the room, the
President broke off in something he was saying, and
remarked: 'Let us proceed to business, gentlemen.'
Mr. Stanton then noticed, with great surprise, that the
President sat with an air of dignity in his chair instead
of lolling about it in the most ungainly attitudes, as
his invariable custom was; and that instead of telling
irrelevant or questionable stories, he was grave and
calm, and quite a different man. Mr. Stanton, on
leaving the council with the Attorney-General, said to
him, 'That is the most satisfactory cabinet meeting I
have attended for many a long day! What an extraordinary
change in Mr. Lincoln!' The Attorney-General
replied, 'We all saw it, before you came in.
While we were waiting for you, he said, with his chin
down on his breast, "Gentlemen, something very extraordinary
is going to happen, and that very soon."'
To which the Attorney-General had observed, 'Something
good, sir, I hope?' when the President answered
very gravely: 'I don't know; I don't know. But it
will happen, and shortly too!' As they were all impressed
by his manner, the Attorney-General took him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_423" id="Page_3_423">[423]</a></span>
up again: 'Have you received any information, sir,
not yet disclosed to us?' 'No,' answered the President:
'but I have had a dream. And I have now had the
same dream three times. Once, on the night preceding
the Battle of Bull Run. Once, on the night preceding'
such another (naming a battle also not favourable to
the North). His chin sank on his breast again, and
he sat reflecting. 'Might one ask the nature of this
dream, sir?' said the Attorney-General. 'Well,' replied
the President, without lifting his head or changing his
attitude, 'I am on a great broad rolling river&mdash;and I
am in a boat&mdash;and I drift&mdash;and I drift!&mdash;But this is
not business&mdash;' suddenly raising his face and looking
round the table as Mr. Stanton entered, 'let us proceed
to business, gentlemen.' Mr. Stanton and the Attorney-General
said, as they walked on together, it
would be curious to notice whether anything ensued
on this; and they agreed to notice. He was shot that
night."</p>

<p>On his birthday, the seventh of February, Dickens
had his interview with President Andrew Johnson.
"This scrambling scribblement is resumed this morning,
because I have just seen the President: who had
sent to me very courteously asking me to make my own
appointment. He is a man with a remarkable face,
indicating courage, watchfulness, and certainly strength
of purpose. It is a face of the Webster type, but
without the 'bounce' of Webster's face. I would have
picked him out anywhere as a character of mark.
Figure, rather stoutish for an American; a trifle under
the middle size; hands clasped in front of him; manner,
suppressed, guarded, anxious. Each of us looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_424" id="Page_3_424">[424]</a></span>
at the other very hard.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was in his own cabinet
that I saw him. As I came away, Thornton drove up
in a sleigh&mdash;turned out for a state occasion&mdash;to deliver
his credentials. There was to be a cabinet council at
12. The room was very like a London club's ante-drawing
room. On the walls, two engravings only:
one, of his own portrait; one, of Lincoln's.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In
the outer room was sitting a certain sunburnt General
Blair, with many evidences of the war upon him. He
got up to shake hands with me, and then I found that
he had been out on the Prairie with me five-and-twenty
years ago.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The papers having referred to my
birthday's falling to-day, my room is filled with most
exquisite flowers.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> They came pouring in from all
sorts of people at breakfast time. The audiences here
are really very fine. So ready to laugh or cry, and
doing both so freely, that you would suppose them
to be Manchester shillings rather than Washington
half-sovereigns. Alas! alas! my cold worse than
ever." So he had written too at the opening of his
letter.</p>

<p>The first reading had been four days earlier, and was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_425" id="Page_3_425">[425]</a></span>
described to his daughter in a letter on the 4th, with a
comical incident that occurred in the course of it.
"The gas was very defective indeed last night, and I
began with a small speech to the effect that I must
trust to the brightness of their faces for the illumination
of mine. This was taken greatly. In the <i>Carol</i>
a most ridiculous incident occurred. All of a sudden,
I saw a dog leap out from among the seats in the centre
aisle, and look very intently at me. The general attention
being fixed on me, I don't think anybody saw this
dog; but I felt so sure of his turning up again and
barking, that I kept my eye wandering about in search
of him. He was a very comic dog, and it was well for
me that I was reading a comic part of the book. But
when he bounced out into the centre aisle again, in an
entirely new place, and (still looking intently at me)
tried the effect of a bark upon my proceedings, I was
seized with such a paroxysm of laughter that it communicated
itself to the audience, and we roared at one
another, loud and long." Three days later the sequel
came, in a letter to his sister-in-law. "I mentioned
the dog on the first night here? Next night, I thought
I heard (in <i>Copperfield</i>) a suddenly-suppressed bark.
It happened in this wise:&mdash;One of our people, standing
just within the door, felt his leg touched, and
looking down beheld the dog, staring intently at me,
and evidently just about to bark. In a transport of
presence of mind and fury, he instantly caught him up
in both hands, and threw him over his own head, out
into the entry, where the check-takers received him
like a game at ball. Last night he came again, <i>with
another dog;</i> but our people were so sharply on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_426" id="Page_3_426">[426]</a></span>
look-out for him that he didn't get in. He had evidently
promised to pass the other dog, free."</p>

<p>What is expressed in these letters, of a still active,
hopeful, enjoying, energetic spirit, able to assert itself
against illness of the body and in some sort to overmaster
it, was also so strongly impressed upon those
who were with him, that, seeing his sufferings as they
did, they yet found it difficult to understand the extent
of them. The sadness thus ever underlying his
triumph makes it all very tragical. "That afternoon
of my birthday," he wrote from Baltimore on the 11th,
"my catarrh was in such a state that Charles Sumner,
coming in at five o'clock, and finding me covered with
mustard poultice, and apparently voiceless, turned to
Dolby and said: 'Surely, Mr. Dolby, it is impossible
that he can read to-night!' Says Dolby: 'Sir, I have
told Mr. Dickens so, four times to-day, and I have been
very anxious. But you have no idea how he will change,
when he gets to the little table.' After five minutes of
the little table I was not (for the time) even hoarse.
The frequent experience of this return of force when it
is wanted, saves me a vast amount of anxiety; but I
am not at times without the nervous dread that I may
some day sink altogether." To the same effect in
another letter he adds: "Dolby and Osgood" (the
latter represented the publishing firm of Mr. Fields
and was one of the travelling staff), "who do the most
ridiculous things to keep me in spirits<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> (I am often very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_427" id="Page_3_427">[427]</a></span>
heavy, and rarely sleep much), are determined to have
a walking match at Boston on the last day of February
to celebrate the arrival of the day when I can say '<i>next</i>
month!' for home." The match ended in the Englishman's
defeat; which Dickens doubly commemorated,
by a narrative of the American victory in sporting-newspaper
style, and by a dinner in Boston to a party
of dear friends there.</p>

<p>After Baltimore he was reading again at Philadelphia,
from which he wrote to his sister-in-law on the 13th as
to a characteristic trait observed in both places.
"Nothing will induce the people to believe in the farewells.
At Baltimore on Tuesday night (a very brilliant
night indeed), they asked as they came out: 'When
will Mr. Dickens read here again?' 'Never.' 'Nonsense!
Not come back, after such houses as these?
Come. Say when he'll read again.' Just the same
here. We could as soon persuade them that I am the
President, as that to-morrow night I am going to read
here for the last time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is a child in this
house&mdash;a little girl&mdash;to whom I presented a black doll
when I was here last; and as I have just seen her eye
at the keyhole since I began writing this, I think she
and the doll must be outside still. 'When you sent it
up to me by the coloured boy,' she said after receiving
it (coloured boy is the term for black waiter), 'I gave
such a cream that Ma come running in and creamed
too, 'cos she fort I'd hurt myself. But I creamed a
cream of joy.' She had a friend to play with her
that day, and brought the friend with her&mdash;to my infinite
confusion. A friend all stockings and much too
tall, who sat on the sofa very far back with her stockings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_428" id="Page_3_428">[428]</a></span>
sticking stiffly out in front of her, and glared at
me, and never spake a word. Dolby found us confronted
in a sort of fascination, like serpent and bird."</p>

<p>On the 15th he was again at New York, in the thick
of more troubles with the speculators. They involved
even charges of fraud in ticket-sales at Newhaven and
Providence; indignation meetings having been held
by the Mayors, and unavailing attempts made by his
manager to turn the wrath aside. "I expect him back
here presently half bereft of his senses, and I should
be wholly bereft of mine if the situation were not
comical as well as disagreeable. We can sell at our
own box-office to any extent; but we cannot buy back
of the speculators, because we have informed the public
that all the tickets are gone; and even if we made
the sacrifice of buying at their price and selling at ours,
we should be accused of treating with them and of
making money by it." It ended in Providence by his
going himself to the town and making a speech; and
in Newhaven it ended by his sending back the money
taken, with intimation that he would not read until
there had been a new distribution of the tickets approved
by all the town. Fresh disturbance broke out
upon this; but he stuck to his determination to delay
the reading until the heats had cooled down, and what
should have been given in the middle of February he
did not give until the close of March.</p>

<p>The Readings he had promised at the smaller outlying
places by the Canadian frontier and Niagara district,
including Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo, were
appointed for that same March month which was to be
the interval between the close of the ordinary readings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_429" id="Page_3_429">[429]</a></span>
and the farewells in the two leading cities. All that
had been promised in New York were closed when he
returned to Boston on the 23rd of February, ready for
the increase he had promised there; but the check of
a sudden political excitement came. It was the month
when the vote was taken for impeachment of President
Johnson. "It is well" (25th of February) "that the
money has flowed in hitherto so fast, for I have a misgiving
that the great excitement about the President's
impeachment will damage our receipts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The vote
was taken at 5 last night. At 7 the three large theatres
here, all in a rush of good business, were stricken with
paralysis. At 8 our long line of outsiders waiting for
unoccupied places, was nowhere. To-day you hear all
the people in the streets talking of only one thing. I
shall suppress my next week's promised readings (by
good fortune, not yet announced), and watch the
course of events. Nothing in this country, as I before
said, lasts long; and I think it likely that the public
may be heartily tired of the President's name by the
9th of March, when I read at a considerable distance
from here. So behold me with a whole week's holiday
in view!" Two days later he wrote pleasantly to
his sister-in-law of his audiences. "They have come
to regard the Readings and the Reader as their peculiar
property; and you would be both amused and pleased
if you could see the curious way in which they show
this increased interest in both. Whenever they laugh
or cry, they have taken to applauding as well; and the
result is very inspiriting. I shall remain here until
Saturday the 7th; but after to-morrow night shall not
read here until the 1st of April, when I begin my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_430" id="Page_3_430">[430]</a></span>
farewells&mdash;six in number." On the 28th he wrote:
"To-morrow fortnight we purpose being at the Falls
of Niagara, and then we shall come back and really
begin to wind up. I have got to know the <i>Carol</i> so
well that I can't remember it, and occasionally go
dodging about in the wildest manner, to pick up lost
pieces. They took it so tremendously last night that
I was stopped every five minutes. One poor young
girl in mourning burst into a passion of grief about
Tiny Tim, and was taken out. We had a fine house,
and, in the interval while I was out, they covered the
little table with flowers. The cough has taken a fresh
start as if it were a novelty, and is even worse than
ever to-day. There is a lull in the excitement about
the President: but the articles of impeachment are to
be produced this afternoon, and then it may set in
again. Osgood came into camp last night from selling
in remote places, and reports that at Rochester and
Buffalo (both places near the frontier), tickets were
bought by Canada people, who had struggled across
the frozen river and clambered over all sorts of obstructions
to get them. Some of those distant halls
turn out to be smaller than represented; but I have no
doubt&mdash;to use an American expression&mdash;that we shall
'get along.' The second half of the receipts cannot
reasonably be expected to come up to the first; political
circumstances, and all other surroundings, considered."</p>

<p>His old ill luck in travel pursued him. On the day
his letter was written a snow-storm began, with a heavy
gale of wind; and "after all the hard weather gone
through," he wrote on the 2nd of March, "this is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_431" id="Page_3_431">[431]</a></span>
worst day we have seen. It is telegraphed that the
storm prevails over an immense extent of country, and
is just the same at Chicago as here. I hope it may
prove a wind up. We are getting sick of the very
sound of sleigh-bells even." The roads were so bad
and the trains so much out of time, that he had to
start a day earlier; and on the 6th of March his tour
north-west began, with the gale still blowing and the
snow falling heavily. On the 13th he wrote to me
from Buffalo.</p>

<p>"We go to the Falls of Niagara to-morrow for our
own pleasure; and I take all the men, as a treat. We
found Rochester last Tuesday in a very curious state.
Perhaps you know that the Great Falls of the Genessee
River (really very fine, even so near Niagara) are at
that place. In the height of a sudden thaw, an immense
bank of ice above the rapids refused to yield;
so that the town was threatened (for the second time
in four years) with submersion. Boats were ready in
the streets, all the people were up all night, and none
but the children slept. In the dead of the night a
thundering noise was heard, the ice gave way, the
swollen river came raging and roaring down the Falls,
and the town was safe. Very picturesque! but 'not very
good for business,' as the manager says. Especially as
the hall stands in the centre of danger, and had ten
feet of water in it on the last occasion of flood. But
I think we had above &pound;200 English. On the previous
night at Syracuse&mdash;a most out of the way and unintelligible-looking
place, with apparently no people in it&mdash;we
had &pound;375 odd. Here, we had last night, and shall
have to-night, whatever we can cram into the hall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_432" id="Page_3_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>"This Buffalo has become a large and important
town, with numbers of German and Irish in it. But it
is very curious to notice, as we touch the frontier, that
the American female beauty dies out; and a woman's
face clumsily compounded of German, Irish, Western
America, and Canadian, not yet fused together, and
not yet moulded, obtains instead. Our show of Beauty
at night is, generally, remarkable; but we had not a
dozen pretty women in the whole throng last night,
and the faces were all blunt. I have just been walking
about, and observing the same thing in the streets.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The winter has been so severe, that the hotel on the
English side at Niagara (which has the best view of the
Falls, and is for that reason very preferable) is not yet
open. So we go, perforce, to the American: which
telegraphs back to our telegram: 'all Mr. Dickens's
requirements perfectly understood.' I have not yet
been in more than two <i>very bad</i> inns. I have been in
some, where a good deal of what is popularly called
'slopping round' has prevailed; but have been able to
get on very well. 'Slopping round,' so used, means
untidyness and disorder. It is a comically expressive
phrase, and has many meanings. Fields was asking
the price of a quarter-cask of sherry the other day.
'Wa'al Mussr Fields,' the merchant replies, 'that
varies according to quality, as is but nay'tral. If yer
wa'ant a sherry just to slop round with it, I can fix
you some at a very low figger.'"</p>

<p>His letter was resumed at Rochester on the 18th.
"After two most brilliant days at the Falls of Niagara,
we got back here last night. To-morrow morning we
turn out at 6 for a long railway journey back to Albany.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_433" id="Page_3_433">[433]</a></span>
But it is nearly all 'back' now, thank God! I don't
know how long, though, before turning, we might have
gone on at Buffalo.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We went everywhere at the
Falls, and saw them in every aspect. There is a suspension
bridge across, now, some two miles or more
from the Horse Shoe; and another, half a mile nearer,
is to be opened in July. They are very fine but very
ticklish, hanging aloft there, in the continual vibration
of the thundering water: nor is one greatly reassured
by the printed notice that troops must not cross them
at step, that bands of music must not play in crossing,
and the like. I shall never forget the last aspect in
which we saw Niagara yesterday. We had been everywhere,
when I thought of struggling (in an open carriage)
up some very difficult ground for a good distance,
and getting where we could stand above the
river, and see it, as it rushes forward to its tremendous
leap, coming for miles and miles. All away to the
horizon on our right was a wonderful confusion of
bright green and white water. As we stood watching
it with our faces to the top of the Falls, our backs were
towards the sun. The majestic valley below the Falls,
so seen through the vast cloud of spray, was made of
rainbow. The high banks, the riven rocks, the forests,
the bridge, the buildings, the air, the sky, were all
made of rainbow. Nothing in Turner's finest water-colour
drawings, done in his greatest day, is so ethereal,
so imaginative, so gorgeous in colour, as what I then
beheld. I seemed to be lifted from the earth and to
be looking into Heaven. What I once said to you, as
I witnessed the scene five and twenty years ago, all
came back at this most affecting and sublime sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_434" id="Page_3_434">[434]</a></span>
The 'muddy vesture of our clay' falls from us as we
look.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I chartered a separate carriage for our men,
so that they might see all in their own way, and at their
own time.</p>

<p>"There is a great deal of water out between Rochester
and New York, and travelling is very uncertain,
as I fear we may find to-morrow. There is again some
little alarm here on account of the river rising too fast.
But our to-night's house is far ahead of the first. Most
charming halls in these places; excellent for sight and
sound. Almost invariably built as theatres, with stage,
scenery, and good dressing-rooms. Audience seated to
perfection (every seat always separate), excellent doorways
and passages, and brilliant light. My screen and
gas are set up in front of the drop-curtain, and the most
delicate touches will tell anywhere. No creature but
my own men ever near me."</p>

<p>His anticipation of the uncertainty that might beset
his travel back had dismal fulfilment. It is described
in a letter written on the 21st from Springfield to his
valued friend, Mr. Frederic Ouvry, having much interest
of its own, and making lively addition to the picture
which these chapters give. The unflagging spirit
that bears up under all disadvantages is again marvellously
shown. "You can hardly imagine what my life
is with its present conditions&mdash;how hard the work is,
and how little time I seem to have at my disposal. It
is necessary to the daily recovery of my voice that I
should dine at 3 when not travelling; I begin to prepare
for the evening at 6; and I get back to my hotel, pretty
well knocked up, at half-past 10. Add to all this, perpetual
railway travelling in one of the severest winters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_435" id="Page_3_435">[435]</a></span>
ever known; and you will descry a reason or two for
my being an indifferent correspondent. Last Sunday
evening I left the Falls of Niagara for this and two intervening
places. As there was a great thaw, and the
melted snow was swelling all the rivers, the whole
country for three hundred miles was flooded. On the
Tuesday afternoon (I had read on the Monday) the
train gave in, as under circumstances utterly hopeless,
and stopped at a place called Utica; the greater part
of which was under water, while the high and dry part
could produce nothing particular to eat. Here, some
of the wretched passengers passed the night in the train,
while others stormed the hotel. I was fortunate enough
to get a bed-room, and garnished it with an enormous
jug of gin-punch; over which I and the manager played
a double-dummy rubber. At six in the morning we
were knocked up: 'to come aboard and try it.' At
half-past six we were knocked up again with the tidings
'that it was of no use coming aboard or trying it.' At
eight all the bells in the town were set agoing, to summon
us to 'come aboard' instantly. And so we started,
through the water, at four or five miles an hour; seeing
nothing but drowned farms, barns adrift like Noah's
arks, deserted villages, broken bridges, and all manner
of ruin. I was to read at Albany that night, and all
the tickets were sold. A very active superintendent
of works assured me that if I could be 'got along' he
was the man to get me along: and that if I couldn't be
got along, I might conclude that it couldn't possibly
be fixed. He then turned on a hundred men in seven-league
boots, who went ahead of the train, each armed
with a long pole and pushing the blocks of ice away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_436" id="Page_3_436">[436]</a></span>
Following this cavalcade, we got to land at last, and
arrived in time for me to read the <i>Carol</i> and <i>Trial</i> triumphantly.
My people (I had five of the staff with
me) turned to at their work with a will, and did a day's
labour in a couple of hours. If we had not come in as
we did, I should have lost &pound;350, and Albany would
have gone distracted. You may conceive what the
flood was, when I hint at the two most notable incidents
of our journey:&mdash;1, We took the passengers out
of two trains, who had been in the water, immovable
all night and all the previous day. 2, We released a
large quantity of sheep and cattle from trucks that had
been in the water I don't know how long, but so long
that the creatures in them had begun to eat each other,
and presented a most horrible spectacle."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>Beside Springfield, he had engagements at Portland,
New Bedford, and other places in Massachusetts, before
the Boston farewells began; and there wanted but two
days to bring him to that time, when he thus described
to his daughter the labour which was to occupy them.
His letter was from Portland on the 29th of March,
and it will be observed that he no longer compromises
or glozes over what he was and had been suffering.
During his terrible travel to Albany his cough had
somewhat spared him, but the old illness had broken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_437" id="Page_3_437">[437]</a></span>
out in his foot; and, though he persisted in ascribing
it to the former supposed origin ("having been lately
again wet, from walking in melted snow, which I suppose
to be the occasion of its swelling in the old way"),
it troubled him sorely, extended now at intervals to
the right foot also, and lamed him for all the time he
remained in the States. "I should have written to
you by the last mail, but I really was too unwell to do
it. The writing day was last Friday, when I ought to
have left Boston for New Bedford (55 miles) before
eleven in the morning. But I was so exhausted that I
could not be got up, and had to take my chance of an
evening train's producing me in time to read&mdash;which
it just did. With the return of snow, nine days ago,
my cough became as bad as ever. I have coughed
every morning from two or three till five or six, and
have been absolutely sleepless. I have had no appetite
besides, and no taste.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Last night here, I took some
laudanum; and it is the only thing that has done me
good, though it made me sick this morning. But the
life, in this climate, is so very hard! When I did
manage to get to New Bedford, I read with my utmost
force and vigour. Next morning, well or ill, I must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_438" id="Page_3_438">[438]</a></span>
turn out at seven, to get back to Boston on my way
here. I dined at Boston at three, and at five had to
come on here (a hundred and thirty miles or so) for
to-morrow night: there being no Sunday train. To-morrow
night I read here in a very large place; and
Tuesday morning at six I must again start, to get back
to Boston once more. But after to-morrow night I have
only the farewells, thank God! Even as it is, however,
I have had to write to Dolby (who is in New York) to
see my doctor there, and ask him to send me some
composing medicine that I can take at night, inasmuch
as without sleep I cannot get through. However sympathetic
and devoted the people are about one, they
<span class="smcap">can not</span> be got to comprehend, seeing me able to do
the two hours when the time comes round, that it may
also involve much misery." To myself on the 30th he
wrote from the same place, making like confession.
No comment could deepen the sadness of the story of
suffering, revealed in his own simple language. "I
write in a town three parts of which were burnt down
in a tremendous fire three years ago. The people lived
in tents while their city was rebuilding. The charred
trunks of the trees with which the streets of the old
city were planted, yet stand here and there in the new
thoroughfares like black spectres. The rebuilding is
still in progress everywhere. Yet such is the astonishing
energy of the people that the large hall in which I
am to read to-night (its predecessor was burnt) would
compare very favourably with the Free Trade Hall at
Manchester!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am nearly used up. Climate, distance,
catarrh, travelling, and hard work, have begun
(I may say so, now they are nearly all over) to tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_439" id="Page_3_439">[439]</a></span>
heavily upon me. Sleeplessness besets me; and if I
had engaged to go on into May, I think I must have
broken down. It was well that I cut off the Far West
and Canada when I did. There would else have been
a sad complication. It is impossible to make the
people about one understand, however zealous and devoted
(it is impossible even to make Dolby understand
until the pinch comes), that the power of coming up
to the mark every night, with spirits and spirit, may
coexist with the nearest approach to sinking under it.
When I got back to Boston on Thursday, after a very
hard three weeks, I saw that Fields was very grave
about my going on to New Bedford (55 miles) next
day, and then coming on here (180 miles) <i>next</i> day.
But the stress is over, and so I can afford to look back
upon it, and think about it, and write about it." On
the 31st he closed his letter at Boston, and he was at
home when I heard of him again. "The latest intelligence,
my dear old fellow, is, that I have arrived
here safely, and that I am certainly better. I consider
my work virtually over, now. My impression is, that
the political crisis will damage the farewells by about
one half. I cannot yet speak by the card; but my
predictions here, as to our proceedings, have thus far
been invariably right. We took last night at Portland,
&pound;360 English; where a costly Italian troupe, using
the same hall to-night, had not booked &pound;14! It is
the same all over the country, and the worst is not
seen yet. Everything is becoming absorbed in the
Presidential impeachment, helped by the next Presidential
election. Connecticut is particularly excited.
The night after I read at Hartford this last week, there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_440" id="Page_3_440">[440]</a></span>
were two political meetings in the town; meetings of
two parties; and the hotel was full of speakers coming
in from outlying places. So at Newhaven: the moment
I had finished, carpenters came in to prepare for
next night's politics. So at Buffalo. So everywhere
very soon."</p>

<p>In the same tone he wrote his last letter to his sister-in-law
from Boston. "My notion of the farewells is
pretty certain now to turn out right. We had &pound;300
English here last night. To-day is a Fast Day, and
to-night we shall probably take much less. Then it is
likely that we shall pull up again, and strike a good
reasonable average; but it is not at all probable that
we shall do anything enormous. Every pulpit in
Massachusetts will resound with violent politics to-day
and to-night." That was on the second of April, and
a postscript was added. "Friday afternoon the 3rd.
Catarrh worse than ever! and we don't know (at four
o'clock) whether I can read to-night or must stop.
Otherwise, all well."</p>

<p>Dickens's last letter from America was written to his
daughter Mary from Boston on the 9th of April, the
day before his sixth and last farewell night. "I not
only read last Friday when I was doubtful of being able
to do so, but read as I never did before, and astonished
the audience quite as much as myself. You never saw
or heard such a scene of excitement. Longfellow and
all the Cambridge men have urged me to give in. I
have been very near doing so, but feel stronger to-day.
I cannot tell whether the catarrh may have done me
any lasting injury in the lungs or other breathing
organs, until I shall have rested and got home. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_441" id="Page_3_441">[441]</a></span>
hope and believe not. Consider the weather! There
have been two snow storms since I wrote last, and to-day
the town is blotted out in a ceaseless whirl of snow
and wind. Dolby is as tender as a woman, and as
watchful as a doctor. He never leaves me during the
reading, now, but sits at the side of the platform, and
keeps his eye upon me all the time. Ditto George the
gasman, steadiest and most reliable man I ever employed.
I have <i>Dombey</i> to do to-night, and must go
through it carefully; so here ends my report. The
personal affection of the people in this place is charming
to the last. Did I tell you that the New York Press
are going to give me a public dinner on Saturday the
18th?"</p>

<p>In New York, where there were five farewell nights,
three thousand two hundred and ninety-eight dollars
were the receipts of the last, on the 20th of April;
those of the last at Boston, on the 8th, having been
three thousand four hundred and fifty-six dollars. But
on earlier nights in the same cities respectively, these
sums also had been reached; and indeed, making
allowance for an exceptional night here and there, the
receipts varied so wonderfully little, that a mention of
the highest average returns from other places will give
no exaggerated impression of the ordinary receipts
throughout. Excluding fractions of dollars, the lowest
were New Bedford ($1640), Rochester ($1906), Springfield
($1970), and Providence ($2140). Albany and
Worcester averaged something less than $2400; while
Hartford, Buffalo, Baltimore, Syracuse, Newhaven, and
Portland rose to $2600. Washington's last night was
$2610, no night there having less than $2500. Philadelphia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_442" id="Page_3_442">[442]</a></span>
exceeded Washington by $300, and Brooklyn
went ahead of Philadelphia by $200. The amount
taken at the four Brooklyn readings was 11,128 dollars.</p>

<p>The New York public dinner was given at Delmonico's,
the hosts were more than two hundred, and
the chair was taken by Mr. Horace Greeley. Dickens
attended with great difficulty,<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and spoke in pain. But
he used the occasion to bear his testimony to the
changes of twenty-five years; the rise of vast new
cities; growth in the graces and amenities of life;
much improvement in the press, essential to every
other advance; and changes in himself leading to
opinions more deliberately formed. He promised his
kindly entertainers that no copy of his <i>Notes</i>, or his
<i>Chuzzlewit</i>, should in future be issued by him without
accompanying mention of the changes to which he had
referred that night; of the politeness, delicacy, sweet
temper, hospitality, and consideration in all ways for
which he had to thank them; and of his gratitude for
the respect shown, during all his visit, to the privacy
enforced upon him by the nature of his work and the
condition of his health.</p>

<p>He had to leave the room before the proceedings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_443" id="Page_3_443">[443]</a></span>
were over. On the following Monday he read to his
last American audience, telling them at the close that
he hoped often to recall them, equally by his winter
fire and in the green summer weather, and never as a
mere public audience but as a host of personal friends.
He sailed two days later in the "Russia," and reached
England in the first week of May 1868.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Favourable</span> weather helped him pleasantly home.
He had profited greatly by the sea voyage, perhaps
greatly more by its repose; and on the 25th of May he
described himself to his Boston friends as brown beyond
belief, and causing the greatest disappointment in all
quarters by looking so well. "My doctor was quite
broken down in spirits on seeing me for the first time
last Saturday. <i>Good Lord! seven years younger!</i> said
the doctor, recoiling." That he gave all the credit to
"those fine days at sea," and none to the rest from
such labours as he had passed through, the close of the
letter too sadly showed. "We are already settling&mdash;think
of this!&mdash;the details of my farewell course of
readings."</p>

<p>Even on his way out to America that enterprise was
in hand. From Halifax he had written to me. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_445" id="Page_3_445">[445]</a></span>
told the Chappells that when I got back to England, I
would have a series of farewell readings in town and
country; and then read No More. They at once offer
in writing to pay all expenses whatever, to pay the ten
per cent. for management, and to pay me, for a series
of 75, six thousand pounds." The terms were raised
and settled before the first Boston readings closed.
The number was to be a hundred; and the payment,
over and above expenses and per centage, eight thousand
pounds. Such a temptation undoubtedly was
great; and though it was a fatal mistake which Dickens
committed in yielding to it, it was not an ignoble one.
He did it under no excitement from the American
gains, of which he knew nothing when he pledged himself
to the enterprise. No man could care essentially
less for mere money than he did. But the necessary
provision for many sons was a constant anxiety; he
was proud of what the Readings had done to abridge
this care; and the very strain of them under which it
seems certain that his health had first given way, and
which he always steadily refused to connect especially
with them, had also broken the old confidence of being
at all times available for his higher pursuit. What
affected his health only he would not regard as part of
the question either way. That was to be borne as the
lot more or less of all men; and the more thorough he
could make his feeling of independence, and of ability
to rest, by what was now in hand, the better his final
chances of a perfect recovery would be. That was the
spirit in which he entered on this last engagement. It
was an opportunity offered for making a particular
work really complete before he should abandon it for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_446" id="Page_3_446">[446]</a></span>
ever. Something of it will not be indiscernible even
in the summary of his past acquisitions, which with a
pardonable exultation he now sent me.</p>

<p>"We had great difficulty in getting our American
accounts squared to the point of ascertaining what
Dolby's commission amounted to in English money.
After all, we were obliged to call in the aid of a money-changer,
to determine what he should pay as his share
of the average loss of conversion into gold. With this
deduction made, I think his commission (I have not
the figures at hand) was &pound;2,888; Ticknor and Fields
had a commission of &pound;1,000, besides 5 per cent. on all
Boston receipts. The expenses in America to the day
of our sailing were 38,948 dollars;&mdash;roughly 39,000
dollars, or &pound;13,000. The preliminary expenses were
&pound;614. The average price of gold was nearly 40 per
cent., and yet my profit was within a hundred or so of
&pound;20,000. Supposing me to have got through the
present engagement in good health, I shall have made
by the Readings, <i>in two years, &pound;</i>33,000: that is to say,
&pound;13,000 received from the Chappells, and &pound;20,000
from America. What I had made by them before, I
could only ascertain by a long examination of Coutts's
books. I should say, certainly not less than &pound;10,000:
for I remember that I made half that money in the first
town and country campaign with poor Arthur Smith.
These figures are of course between ourselves; but
don't you think them rather remarkable? The Chappell
bargain began with &pound;50 a night and everything
paid; then became &pound;60; and now rises to &pound;80."</p>

<p>The last readings were appointed to begin with October;
and at the request of an old friend, Chauncy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_447" id="Page_3_447">[447]</a></span>
Hare Townshend, who died during his absence in the
States, he had accepted the trust, which occupied him
some part of the summer, of examining and selecting
for publication a bequest of some papers on matters of
religious belief, which were issued in a small volume
the following year. There came also in June a visit
from Longfellow and his daughters, with later summer
visits from the Eliot Nortons; and at the arrival of
friends whom he loved and honoured as he did these,
from the great country to which he owed so much, infinite
were the rejoicings of Gadshill. Nothing could
quench his old spirit in this way. But in the intervals
of my official work I saw him frequently that summer,
and never without the impression that America had told
heavily upon him. There was manifest abatement of
his natural force, the elasticity of bearing was impaired,
and the wonderful brightness of eye was dimmed at
times. One day, too, as he walked from his office with
Miss Hogarth to dine at our house, he could read only
the halves of the letters over the shop doors that were
on his right as he looked. He attributed it to medicine.
It was an additional unfavourable symptom that
his right foot had become affected as well as the left,
though not to anything like the same extent, during the
journey from the Canada frontier to Boston. But all
this disappeared, upon any special cause for exertion;
and he was never unprepared to lavish freely for others
the reserved strength that should have been kept for
himself. This indeed was the great danger, for it
dulled the apprehension of us all to the fact that absolute
and pressing danger did positively exist.</p>

<p>He had scarcely begun these last readings than he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_448" id="Page_3_448">[448]</a></span>
was beset by a misgiving, that, for a success large
enough to repay Messrs. Chappell's liberality, the enterprise
would require a new excitement to carry him
over the old ground; and it was while engaged in Manchester
and Liverpool at the outset of October that this
announcement came. "I have made a short reading
of the murder in <i>Oliver Twist</i>. I cannot make up my
mind, however, whether to do it or not. I have no
doubt that I could perfectly petrify an audience by
carrying out the notion I have of the way of rendering
it. But whether the impression would not be so horrible
as to keep them away another time, is what I cannot
satisfy myself upon. What do you think? It is in
three short parts: 1, Where Fagin sets Noah Claypole
on to watch Nancy. 2, The scene on London Bridge.
3, Where Fagin rouses Claypole from his sleep, to tell
his perverted story to Sikes. And the Murder, and the
Murderer's sense of being haunted. I have adapted
and cut about the text with great care, and it is very
powerful. I have to-day referred the book and the
question to the Chappells as so largely interested." I
had a strong dislike to this proposal, less perhaps on
the ground which ought to have been taken of the
physical exertion it would involve, than because such a
subject seemed to be altogether out of the province of
reading; and it was resolved, that, before doing it,
trial should be made to a limited private audience in
St. James's Hall. The note announcing this, from
Liverpool on the 25th of October, is for other reasons
worth printing. "I give you earliest notice that the
Chappells suggest to me the 18th of November" (the
14th was chosen) "for trial of the <i>Oliver Twist</i> murder,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_449" id="Page_3_449">[449]</a></span>
when everything in use for the previous day's reading
can be made available. I hope this may suit you?
We have been doing well here; and how it was arranged,
nobody knows, but we had &pound;410 at St. James's
Hall last Tuesday, having advanced from our previous
&pound;360. The expenses are such, however, on the
princely scale of the Chappells, that we never begin at a
smaller, often at a larger, cost than &pound;180.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have
not been well, and have been heavily tired. However,
I have little to complain of&mdash;nothing, nothing; though,
like Mariana, I am aweary. But think of this. If all
go well, and (like Mr. Dennis) I 'work off' this series
triumphantly, I shall have made of these readings
&pound;28,000 in a year and a half." This did not better
reconcile me to what had been too clearly forced upon
him by the supposed necessity of some new excitement
to ensure a triumphant result; and even the private
rehearsal only led to a painful correspondence between
us, of which a few words are all that need now be preserved.
"We might have agreed," he wrote, "to
differ about it very well, because we only wanted to
find out the truth if we could, and because it was quite
understood that I wanted to leave behind me the recollection
of something very passionate and dramatic,
done with simple means, if the art would justify the
theme." Apart from mere personal considerations,
the whole question lay in these last words. It was
impossible for me to admit that the effect to be produced
was legitimate, or such as it was desirable to
associate with the recollection of his readings.</p>

<p>Mention should not be omitted of two sorrows which
affected him at this time. At the close of the month<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_450" id="Page_3_450">[450]</a></span>
before the readings began his youngest son went forth
from home to join an elder brother in Australia.
"These partings are hard hard things" (26th of September),
"but they are the lot of us all, and might
have to be done without means or influence, and then
would be far harder. God bless him!" Hardly a
month later, the last of his surviving brothers, Frederick,
the next to himself, died at Darlington. "He
had been tended" (24th of October) "with the greatest
care and affection by some local friends. It was a
wasted life, but God forbid that one should be hard
upon it, or upon anything in this world that is not
deliberately and coldly wrong."</p>

<p>Before October closed the renewal of his labour had
begun to tell upon him. He wrote to his sister-in-law
on the 29th of sickness and sleepless nights, and of its
having become necessary, when he had to read, that
he should lie on the sofa all day. After arrival at Edinburgh
in December he had been making a calculation
that the railway travelling over such a distance involved
something more than thirty thousand shocks to the
nerves; but he went on to Christmas, alternating these
far-off places with nights regularly intervening in London,
without much more complaint than of an inability
to sleep. Trade reverses at Glasgow had checked the
success there,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> but Edinburgh made compensation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_451" id="Page_3_451">[451]</a></span>
"The affectionate regard of the people exceeds all
bounds and is shown in every way. The audiences do
everything but embrace me, and take as much pains
with the readings as I do.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The keeper of the
Edinburgh hall, a fine old soldier, presented me on
Friday night with the most superb red camellia for my
button-hole that ever was seen. Nobody can imagine
how he came by it, as the florists had had a considerable
demand for that colour, from ladies in the stalls,
and could get no such thing."</p>

<p>The second portion of the enterprise opened with
the New Year, and the <i>Sikes and Nancy</i> scenes, everywhere
his prominent subject, exacted the most terrible
physical exertion from him. In January he was at
Clifton, where he had given, he told his sister-in-law,
"by far the best Murder yet done;" while at the same
date he wrote to his daughter: "At Clifton on Monday
night we had a contagion of fainting; and yet the
place was not hot. I should think we had from a dozen
to twenty ladies taken out stiff and rigid, at various
times! It became quite ridiculous." He was afterwards
at Cheltenham. "Macready is of opinion that
the Murder is two Macbeths. He declares that he
heard every word of the reading, but I doubt it.
Alas! he is sadly infirm." On the 27th he wrote to
his daughter from Torquay that the place into which
they had put him to read, and where a pantomime had
been played the night before, was something between
a Methodist chapel, a theatre, a circus, a riding-school,
and a cow-house. That day he wrote to me from Bath:
"Landor's ghost goes along the silent streets here before
me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The place looks to me like a cemetery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_452" id="Page_3_452">[452]</a></span>
which the Dead have succeeded in rising and taking.
Having built streets, of their old gravestones, they
wander about scantly trying to 'look alive.' A dead
failure."</p>

<p>In the second week of February he was in London,
under engagement to return to Scotland (which he had
just left) after the usual weekly reading at St. James's
Hall, when there was a sudden interruption. "My
foot has turned lame again!" was his announcement
to me on the 15th, followed next day by this letter.
"Henry Thompson will not let me read to-night, and
will not let me go to Scotland to-morrow. Tremendous
house here, and also in Edinburgh. Here is
the certificate he drew up for himself and Beard to
sign. 'We the undersigned hereby certify that Mr.
C. D. is suffering from inflammation of the foot (caused
by over-exertion), and that we have forbidden his appearance
on the platform this evening, as he must keep
his room for a day or two.' I have sent up to the
Great Western Hotel for apartments, and, if I can get
them, shall move there this evening. Heaven knows
what engagements this may involve in April! It
throws us all back, and will cost me some five hundred
pounds."</p>

<p>A few days' rest again brought so much relief, that,
against the urgent entreaties of members of his family
as well as other friends, he was in the railway carriage
bound for Edinburgh on the morning of the 20th of
February, accompanied by Mr. Chappell himself. "I
came down lazily on a sofa," he wrote to me from
Edinburgh next day, "hardly changing my position
the whole way. The railway authorities had done all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_453" id="Page_3_453">[453]</a></span>
sorts of things, and I was more comfortable than on the
sofa at the hotel. The foot gave me no uneasiness, and
has been quiet and steady all night."<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> He was nevertheless
under the necessity, two days later, of consulting
Mr. Syme; and he told his daughter that this great
authority had warned him against over-fatigue in the
readings, and given him some slight remedies, but
otherwise reported him in "joost pairfactly splendid
condition." With care he thought the pain might be
got rid of. "'Wa'at mad' Thompson think it was
goot?' he said often, and seemed to take that opinion
extremely ill." Again before leaving Scotland he saw
Mr. Syme, and wrote to me on the second of March
of the indignation with which he again treated the
gout diagnosis, declaring the disorder to be an affection
of the delicate nerves and muscles originating in
cold. "I told him that it had shewn itself in America
in the other foot as well. 'Noo I'll joost swear,' said
he, 'that ayond the fatigue o' the readings ye'd been
tramping i' th' snaw, within twa or three days.' I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_454" id="Page_3_454">[454]</a></span>
certainly had. 'Wa'al,' said he triumphantly, 'and
hoo did it first begin? I' th' snaw. Goot! Bah!&mdash;Thompson
knew no other name for it, and just ca'd it
Goot&mdash;Boh!' For which he took two guineas." Yet
the famous pupil, Sir Henry Thompson, went certainly
nearer the mark than the distinguished master, Mr.
Syme, in giving to it a more than local character.</p>

<p>The whole of that March month he went on with the
scenes from <i>Oliver Twist</i>. "The foot goes famously,"
he wrote to his daughter. "I feel the fatigue in it
(four Murders in one week<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>) but not overmuch. It
merely aches at night; and so does the other, sympathetically
I suppose." At Hull on the 8th he heard of
the death of the old and dear friend, Emerson Tennent,
to whom he had inscribed his last book; and on the
morning of the 12th I met him at the funeral. He had
read the <i>Oliver Twist</i> scenes the night before at York;
had just been able to get to the express train, after
shortening the pauses in the reading, by a violent rush
when it was over; and had travelled through the night.
He appeared to, me "dazed" and worn. No man
could well look more so than he did, that sorrowful
morning.</p>

<p>The end was near. A public dinner, which will have
mention on a later page, had been given him in Liverpool
on the 10th of April, with Lord Dufferin in the
chair, and a reading was due from him in Preston on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_455" id="Page_3_455">[455]</a></span>
the 22nd of that month. But on Sunday the 18th we
had ill report of him from Chester, and on the 21st he
wrote from Blackpool to his sister-in-law. "I have
come to this Sea-Beach Hotel (charming) for a day's
rest. I am much better than I was on Sunday; but
shall want careful looking to, to get through the readings.
My weakness and deadness are all on the left
side; and if I don't look at anything I try to touch
with my left hand, I don't know where it is. I am in
(secret) consultation with Frank Beard, who says that
I have given him indisputable evidences of overwork
which he could wish to treat immediately; and so I
have telegraphed for him. I have had a delicious walk
by the sea to-day, and I sleep soundly, and have picked
up amazingly in appetite. My foot is greatly better
too, and I wear my own boot." Next day was appointed
for the reading at Preston; and from that
place he wrote to me, while waiting the arrival of Mr.
Beard. "Don't say anything about it, but the tremendously
severe nature of this work is a little shaking
me. At Chester last Sunday I found myself extremely
giddy, and extremely uncertain of my sense of touch,
both in the left leg and the left hand and arms. I had
been taking some slight medicine of Beard's; and immediately
wrote to him describing exactly what I felt,
and asking him whether those feelings <i>could be</i> referable
to the medicine? He promptly replied: 'There can
be no mistaking them from your exact account. The
medicine cannot possibly have caused them. I recognise
indisputable symptoms of overwork, and I wish to
take you in hand without any loss of time.' They
have greatly modified since, but he is coming down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_456" id="Page_3_456">[456]</a></span>
here this afternoon. To-morrow night at Warrington
I shall have but 25 more nights to work through. If
he can coach me up for them, I do not doubt that I shall
get all right again&mdash;as I did when I became free in
America. The foot has given me very little trouble.
Yet it is remarkable that it is <i>the left foot too;</i> and that
I told Henry Thompson (before I saw his old master
Syme) that I had an inward conviction that whatever
it was, it was not gout. I also told Beard, a year after
the Staplehurst accident, that I was certain that my
heart had been fluttered, and wanted a little helping.
This the stethoscope confirmed; and considering the
immense exertion I am undergoing, and the constant
jarring of express trains, the case seems to me quite
intelligible. Don't say anything in the Gad's direction
about my being a little out of sorts. I have
broached the matter of course; but very lightly. Indeed
there is no reason for broaching it otherwise."</p>

<p>Even to the close of that letter he had buoyed himself
up with the hope that he might yet be "coached"
and that the readings need not be discontinued. But
Mr. Beard stopped them at once, and brought his
patient to London. On Friday morning the 23rd, the
same envelope brought me a note from himself to say
that he was well enough, but tired; in perfectly good
spirits, not at all uneasy, and writing this himself that
I should have it under his own hand; with a note from
his eldest son to say that his father appeared to him to
be very ill, and that a consultation had been appointed
with Sir Thomas Watson. The statement of that distinguished
physician, sent to myself in June 1872,
completes for the present the sorrowful narrative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_457" id="Page_3_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was, I think, on the 23rd of April 1869 that I
was asked to see Charles Dickens, in consultation with
Mr. Carr Beard. After I got home I jotted down, from
their joint account, what follows.</p>

<p>"After unusual irritability, C. D. found himself, last
Saturday or Sunday, giddy, with a tendency to go backwards,
and to turn round. Afterwards, desiring to put
something on a small table, he pushed it and the table
forwards, undesignedly. He had some odd feeling of
insecurity about his left leg, as if there was something
unnatural about his heel; but he could lift, and he did
not drag, his leg. Also he spoke of some strangeness
of his left hand and arm; missed the spot on which
he wished to lay that hand, unless he carefully looked
at it; felt an unreadiness to lift his hands towards his
head, especially his left hand&mdash;when, for instance, he
was brushing his hair.</p>

<p>"He had written thus to Mr. Carr Beard.</p>

<p>"'Is it possible that anything in my medicine can
have made me extremely giddy, extremely uncertain
of my footing, especially on the left side, and extremely
indisposed to raise my hands to my head. These symptoms
made me very uncomfortable on Saturday (qy.
Sunday?) night, and all yesterday, &amp;c.'</p>

<p>"The state thus described showed plainly that C.
D. had been on the brink of an attack of paralysis of
his left side, and possibly of apoplexy. It was, no
doubt, the result of extreme hurry, overwork, and
excitement, incidental to his Readings.</p>

<p>"On hearing from him Mr. Carr Beard had gone at
once to Preston, or Blackburn (I am not sure which),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_458" id="Page_3_458">[458]</a></span>
had forbidden his reading that same evening, and had
brought him to London.</p>

<p>"When I saw him he <i>appeared</i> to be well. His mind
was unclouded, his pulse quiet. His heart was beating
with some slight excess of the natural impulse. He
told me he had of late sometimes, but rarely, lost or
misused a word; that he forgot names, and numbers,
but had always done that; and he promised implicit
obedience to our injunctions.</p>

<p>"We gave him the following certificate.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"'The undersigned certify that Mr. Charles Dickens
has been seriously unwell, through great exhaustion and
fatigue of body and mind consequent upon his public
Readings and long and frequent railway journeys. In
our judgment Mr. Dickens will not be able with safety
to himself to resume his Readings for several months
to come.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"'<span class="smcap">Thos. Watson, M.D.</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"'<span class="smcap">F. Carr Beard.</span>'</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>"However, after some weeks, he expressed a wish
for my sanction to his endeavours to redeem, in a
careful and moderate way, some of the reading engagements
to which he had been pledged before those
threatenings of brain-mischief in the North of England.</p>

<p>"As he had continued uniformly to seem and to
feel perfectly well, I did not think myself warranted
to refuse that sanction: and in writing to enforce great
caution in the trials, I expressed some apprehension
that he might fancy we had been too peremptory in
our injunctions of mental and bodily repose in April;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_459" id="Page_3_459">[459]</a></span>
and I quoted the following remark, which occurs somewhere
in one of Captain Cook's Voyages. 'Preventive
measures are always invidious, for when most successful,
the necessity for them is the least apparent.'</p>

<p>"I mention this to explain the letter which I send
herewith,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> and which I must beg you to return to me,
as a precious remembrance of the writer with whom
I had long enjoyed very friendly and much valued
relations.</p>

<p>"I scarcely need say that if what I have now written
can, <i>in any way</i>, be of use to you, it is entirely at your
service and disposal&mdash;nor need I say with how much
interest I have read the first volume of your late friend's
Life. I cannot help regretting that a great pressure of
professional work at the time, prevented my making a
fuller record of a case so interesting."</p>

<p>The twelve readings to which Sir Thomas Watson
consented, with the condition that railway travel was
not to accompany them, were farther to be delayed
until the opening months of 1870. They were an offering
from Dickens by way of small compensation to
Messrs. Chappell for the breakdown of the enterprise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_460" id="Page_3_460">[460]</a></span>
on which they had staked so much. But here practically
he finished his career as a public reader, and what
remains will come with the end of what is yet to be
told. One effort only intervened, by which he hoped
to get happily back to his old pursuits; but to this, as
to that which preceded it, sterner Fate said also No,
and his Last Book, like his Last Readings, prematurely
closed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>LAST BOOK.</h3>

<h3>1869-1870.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">First Fancy for <i>Edwin Drood</i>&mdash;Story as planned in his Mind&mdash;Nothing
written of his Intentions&mdash;Merits of the Fragment&mdash;Comparison
of his Early and his Late MSS.&mdash;Discovery of Unpublished
Scene&mdash;Probable Reason for writing it in Advance&mdash;How Mr.
Sapsea ceased to be a Member of the Eight Club.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last book undertaken by Dickens was to be published,
in illustrated monthly numbers, of the old form,
but to close with the twelfth.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> It closed, unfinished,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_462" id="Page_3_462">[462]</a></span>
with the sixth number, which was itself underwritten
by two pages.</p>

<p>His first fancy for the tale was expressed in a letter
in the middle of July. "What should you think of
the idea of a story beginning in this way?&mdash;Two people,
boy and girl, or very young, going apart from one another,
pledged to be married after many years&mdash;at the
end of the book. The interest to arise out of the
tracing of their separate ways, and the impossibility of
telling what will be done with that impending fate."
This was laid aside; but it left a marked trace on the
story as afterwards designed, in the position of Edwin
Drood and his betrothed.</p>

<p>I first heard of the later design in a letter dated
"Friday the 6th of August 1869," in which after
speaking, with the usual unstinted praise he bestowed
always on what moved him in others, of a little tale
he had received for his journal,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> he spoke of the change<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_463" id="Page_3_463">[463]</a></span>
that had occurred to him for the new tale by himself.
"I laid aside the fancy I told you of, and have a very
curious and new idea for my new story. Not a communicable
idea (or the interest of the book would be
gone), but a very strong one, though difficult to work."
The story, I learnt immediately afterward, was to be
that of the murder of a nephew by his uncle; the
originality of which was to consist in the review of the
murderer's career by himself at the close, when its
temptations were to be dwelt upon as if, not he the
culprit, but some other man, were the tempted. The
last chapters were to be written in the condemned cell,
to which his wickedness, all elaborately elicited from
him as if told of another, had brought him. Discovery
by the murderer of the utter needlessness of the murder
for its object, was to follow hard upon commission of
the deed; but all discovery of the murderer was to be
baffled till towards the close, when, by means of a gold
ring which had resisted the corrosive effects of the lime
into which he had thrown the body, not only the person
murdered was to be identified but the locality of the
crime and the man who committed it.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> So much was
told to me before any of the book was written; and it
will be recollected that the ring, taken by Drood to be
given to his betrothed only if their engagement went
on, was brought away with him from their last interview.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_464" id="Page_3_464">[464]</a></span>
Rosa was to marry Tartar, and Crisparkle the
sister of Landless, who was himself, I think, to have
perished in assisting Tartar finally to unmask and seize
the murderer.</p>

<p>Nothing had been written, however, of the main
parts of the design excepting what is found in the published
numbers; there was no hint or preparation for
the sequel in any notes of chapters in advance; and
there remained not even what he had himself so sadly
written of the book by Thackeray also interrupted by
death. The evidence of matured designs never to be
accomplished, intentions planned never to be executed,
roads of thought marked out never to be traversed,
goals shining in the distance never to be reached, was
wanting here. It was all a blank. Enough had been
completed nevertheless to give promise of a much
greater book than its immediate predecessor. "I
hope his book is finished," wrote Longfellow when
the news of his death was flashed to America. "It is
certainly one of his most beautiful works, if not the
most beautiful of all. It would be too sad to think
the pen had fallen from his hand, and left it incomplete."
Some of its characters were touched with
subtlety, and in its descriptions his imaginative power
was at its best. Not a line was wanting to the reality,
in the most minute local detail, of places the most
widely contrasted; and we saw with equal vividness
the lazy cathedral town and the lurid opium-eater's
den.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Something like the old lightness and buoyancy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_465" id="Page_3_465">[465]</a></span>
of animal spirits gave a new freshness to the humour;
the scenes of the child-heroine and her luckless betrothed
had both novelty and nicety of character in
them; and Mr. Grewgious in chambers with his clerk
and the two waiters, the conceited fool Sapsea, and
the blustering philanthropist Honeythunder, were first-rate
comedy. Miss Twinkleton was of the family of
Miss La Creevy; and the lodging-house keeper, Miss
Billickin, though she gave Miss Twinkleton but a sorry
account of her blood, had that of Mrs. Todgers in her
veins. "I was put in life to a very genteel boarding-school,
the mistress being no less a lady than yourself,
of about your own age, or it may be, some years
younger, and a poorness of blood flowed from the
table which has run through my life." Was ever anything
better said of a school-fare of starved gentility?</p>

<p>The last page of <i>Edwin Drood</i> was written in the
Ch&acirc;let in the afternoon of his last day of consciousness;
and I have thought there might be some interest
in a facsimile of the greater part of this final page of
manuscript that ever came from his hand, at which he
had worked unusually late in order to finish the chapter.
It has very much the character, in its excessive care of
correction and interlineation, of all his later manuscripts;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_466" id="Page_3_466">[466]</a></span>
and in order that comparison may be made
with his earlier and easier method, I place beside it a
portion of a page of the original of <i>Oliver Twist</i>. His
greater pains and elaboration of writing, it may be
mentioned, become first very obvious in the later parts
of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit;</i> but not the least remarkable
feature in all his manuscripts, is the accuracy with
which the portions of each representing the several
numbers are exactly adjusted to the space the printer
had to fill. Whether without erasure or so interlined
as to be illegible, nothing is wanting, and there is
nothing in excess. So assured was the habit, that he
has himself remarked upon an instance the other way,
in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, as not having happened to him
for thirty years. But <i>Edwin Drood</i> more startlingly
showed him how unsettled the habit he most prized
had become, in the clashing of old and new pursuits.
"When I had written" (22nd of December 1869)
"and, as I thought, disposed of the first two Numbers
of my story, Clowes informed me to my horror that
they were, together, <i>twelve printed pages too short!</i>!!
Consequently I had to transpose a chapter from number
two to number one, and remodel number two altogether!
This was the more unlucky, that it came upon
me at the time when I was obliged to leave the book,
in order to get up the Readings" (the additional twelve
for which Sir Thomas Watson's consent had been obtained),
"quite gone out of my mind since I left them
off. However, I turned to it and got it done, and
both numbers are now in type. Charles Collins has
designed an excellent cover." It was his wish that his
son-in-law should have illustrated the story; but, this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_467" id="Page_3_467">[467]</a></span>
not being practicable, upon an opinion expressed by
Mr. Millais which the result thoroughly justified, choice
was made of Mr. S. L. Fildes.</p>

<p>This reference to the last effort of Dickens's genius
had been written as it thus stands, when a discovery of
some interest was made by the writer. Within the
leaves of one of Dickens's other manuscripts were
found some detached slips of his writing, on paper
only half the size of that used for the tale, so cramped,
interlined, and blotted as to be nearly illegible, which
on close inspection proved to be a scene in which Sapsea
the auctioneer is introduced as the principal figure,
among a group of characters new to the story. The
explanation of it perhaps is, that, having become a
little nervous about the course of the tale, from a fear
that he might have plunged too soon into the incidents
leading on to the catastrophe, such as the Datchery
assumption in the fifth number (a misgiving he had
certainly expressed to his sister-in-law), it had occurred
to him to open some fresh veins of character incidental
to the interest, though not directly part of it, and so to
handle them in connection with Sapsea as a little to
suspend the final development even while assisting to
strengthen it. Before beginning any number of a serial
he used, as we have seen in former instances, to plan
briefly what he intended to put into it chapter by chapter;
and his first number-plan of <i>Drood</i> had the following:
"Mr. Sapsea. Old Tory jackass. Connect Jasper
with him. (He will want a solemn donkey by and
by):" which was effected by bringing together both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_470" id="Page_3_470">[470]</a></span>
Durdles and Jasper, for connection with Sapsea, in the
matter of the epitaph for Mrs. Sapsea's tomb. The
scene now discovered might in this view have been designed
to strengthen and carry forward that element in
the tale; and otherwise it very sufficiently expresses
itself. It would supply an answer, if such were needed,
to those who have asserted that the hopeless decadence
of Dickens as a writer had set in before his death.
Among the lines last written by him, these are the very
last we can ever hope to receive; and they seem to me
a delightful specimen of the power possessed by him in
his prime, and the rarest which any novelist can have,
of revealing a character by a touch. Here are a couple
of people, Kimber and Peartree, not known to us before,
whom we read off thoroughly in a dozen words;
and as to Sapsea himself, auctioneer and mayor of
Cloisterham, we are face to face with what before we
only dimly realised, and we see the solemn jackass, in
his business pulpit, playing off the airs of Mr. Dean in
his Cathedral pulpit, with Cloisterham laughing at the
impostor.</p>


<div class='center'>
"HOW MR. SAPSEA CEASED TO BE A MEMBER OF<br />
THE EIGHT CLUB.<br />
<br />
"TOLD BY HIMSELF.<br />
</div>

<p>"Wishing to take the air, I proceeded by a circuitous
route to the Club, it being our weekly night of meeting.
I found that we mustered our full strength. We were
enrolled under the denomination of the Eight Club.
We were eight in number; we met at eight o'clock
during eight months of the year; we played eight
games of four-handed cribbage, at eightpence the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_471" id="Page_3_471">[471]</a></span>
game; our frugal supper was composed of eight rolls,
eight mutton chops, eight pork sausages, eight baked
potatoes, eight marrow-bones, with eight toasts, and
eight bottles of ale. There may, or may not, be a
certain harmony of colour in the ruling idea of this (to
adopt a phrase of our lively neighbours) reunion. It
was a little idea of mine.</p>

<p>"A somewhat popular member of the Eight Club,
was a member by the name of Kimber. By profession,
a dancing-master. A commonplace, hopeful sort of
man, wholly destitute of dignity or knowledge of the
world.</p>

<p>"As I entered the Club-room, Kimber was making
the remark: 'And he still half-believes him to be very
high in the Church.'</p>

<p>"In the act of hanging up my hat on the eighth peg
by the door, I caught Kimber's visual ray. He lowered
it, and passed a remark on the next change of the
moon. I did not take particular notice of this at the
moment, because the world was often pleased to be a
little shy of ecclesiastical topics in my presence. For
I felt that I was picked out (though perhaps only
through a coincidence) to a certain extent to represent
what I call our glorious constitution in Church and
State. The phrase may be objected to by captious
minds; but I own to it as mine. I threw it off in
argument some little time back. I said: <span class="smcap">'Our Glorious
Constitution</span> in <span class="smcap">Church</span> and <span class="smcap">State</span>.'</p>

<p>"Another member of the Eight Club was Peartree;
also member of the Royal College of Surgeons. Mr.
Peartree is not accountable to me for his opinions, and
I say no more of them here than that he attends the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_472" id="Page_3_472">[472]</a></span>
poor gratis whenever they want him, and is not the
parish doctor. Mr. Peartree may justify it to the
grasp of <i>his</i> mind thus to do his republican utmost to
bring an appointed officer into contempt. Suffice it
that Mr. Peartree can never justify it to the grasp of
<i>mine</i>.</p>

<p>"Between Peartree and Kimber there was a sickly
sort of feeble-minded alliance. It came under my
particular notice when I sold off Kimber by auction.
(Goods taken in execution). He was a widower in a
white under-waistcoat, and slight shoes with bows, and
had two daughters not ill-looking. Indeed the reverse.
Both daughters taught dancing in scholastic establishments
for Young Ladies&mdash;had done so at Mrs. Sapsea's;
nay, Twinkleton's&mdash;and both, in giving lessons, presented
the unwomanly spectacle of having little fiddles
tucked under their chins. In spite of which, the
younger one might, if I am correctly informed&mdash;I will
raise the veil so far as to say I <span class="smcap">know</span> she might&mdash;have
soared for life from this degrading taint, but for having
the class of mind allotted to what I call the common
herd, and being so incredibly devoid of veneration as
to become painfully ludicrous.</p>

<p>"When I sold off Kimber without reserve, Peartree
(as poor as he can hold together) had several prime
household lots knocked down to him. I am not to be
blinded; and of course it was as plain to me what he
was going to do with them, as it was that he was a
brown hulking sort of revolutionary subject who had
been in India with the soldiers, and ought (for the
sake of society) to have his neck broke. I saw the lots
shortly afterwards in Kimber's lodgings&mdash;through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_473" id="Page_3_473">[473]</a></span>
window&mdash;and I easily made out that there had been a
sneaking pretence of lending them till better times. A
man with a smaller knowledge of the world than myself
might have been led to suspect that Kimber had
held back money from his creditors, and fraudulently
bought the goods. But, besides that I knew for certain
he had no money, I knew that this would involve a
species of forethought not to be made compatible with
the frivolity of a caperer, inoculating other people with
capering, for his bread.</p>

<p>"As it was the first time I had seen either of those
two since the sale, I kept myself in what I call Abeyance.
When selling him up, I had delivered a few
remarks&mdash;shall I say a little homely?&mdash;concerning
Kimber, which the world did regard as more than
usually worth notice. I had come up into my pulpit;,
it was said, uncommonly like&mdash;and a murmur of recognition
had repeated his (I will not name whose) title,
before I spoke. I had then gone on to say that all
present would find, in the first page of the catalogue
that was lying before them, in the last paragraph before
the first lot, the following words: 'Sold in pursuance
of a writ of execution issued by a creditor.' I had
then proceeded to remind my friends, that however
frivolous, not to say contemptible, the business by
which a man got his goods together, still his goods were
as dear to him, and as cheap to society (if sold without
reserve), as though his pursuits had been of a character
that would bear serious contemplation. I had then
divided my text (if I may be allowed so to call it) into
three heads: firstly, Sold; secondly, In pursuance of a
writ of execution; thirdly, Issued by a creditor; with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_474" id="Page_3_474">[474]</a></span>
a few moral reflections on each, and winding up
with, 'Now to the first lot' in a manner that was
complimented when I afterwards mingled with my
hearers.</p>

<p>"So, not being certain on what terms I and Kimber
stood, I was grave, I was chilling. Kimber, however,
moving to me, I moved to Kimber. (I was
the creditor who had issued the writ. Not that it
matters.)</p>

<p>"'I was alluding, Mr. Sapsea,' said Kimber, 'to a
stranger who entered into conversation with me in the
street as I came to the Club. He had been speaking
to you just before, it seemed, by the churchyard; and
though you had told him who you were, I could
hardly persuade him that you were not high in the
Church.'</p>

<p>"'Idiot!' said Peartree.</p>

<p>"'Ass!' said Kimber.</p>

<p>"'Idiot and Ass!" said the other five members.</p>

<p>"'Idiot and Ass, gentlemen,' I remonstrated, looking
around me, 'are strong expressions to apply to a
young man of good appearance and address.' My
generosity was roused; I own it.</p>

<p>"'You'll admit that he must be a Fool,' said Peartree.</p>

<p>"'You can't deny that he must be a Blockhead,
said Kimber.</p>

<p>"Their tone of disgust amounted to being offensive.
Why should the young man be so calumniated? What
had he done? He had only made an innocent and
natural mistake. I controlled my generous indignation,
and said so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_475" id="Page_3_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Natural?' repeated Kimber; '<i>He's</i> a Natural!'</p>

<p>"The remaining six members of the Eight Club
laughed unanimously. It stung me. It was a scornful
laugh. My anger was roused in behalf of an absent,
friendless stranger. I rose (for I had been sitting
down).</p>

<p>"'Gentlemen,' I said with dignity, 'I will not remain
one of this Club allowing opprobrium to be cast
on an unoffending person in his absence. I will not
so violate what I call the sacred rites of hospitality.
Gentlemen, until you know how to behave yourselves
better, I leave you. Gentlemen, until then I withdraw,
from this place of meeting, whatever personal qualifications
I may have brought into it. Gentlemen, until
then you cease to be the Eight Club, and must make the
best you can of becoming the Seven.'</p>

<p>"I put on my hat and retired. As I went down
stairs I distinctly heard them give a suppressed cheer.
Such is the power of demeanour and knowledge of
mankind. I had forced it out of them.</p>


<div class='center'>
"II.<br />
</div>

<p>"Whom should I meet in the street, within a few
yards of the door of the inn where the Club was held,
but the self-same young man whose cause I had felt it
my duty so warmly&mdash;and I will add so disinterestedly&mdash;to
take up.</p>

<p>"Is it Mr. Sapsea,' he said doubtfully, 'or is
it&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'It is Mr. Sapsea,' I replied.</p>

<p>"'Pardon me, Mr. Sapsea; you appear warm, sir,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_476" id="Page_3_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I have been warm,' I said, 'and on your account.'
Having stated the circumstances at some length (my
generosity almost overpowered him), I asked him his
name.</p>

<p>"'Mr. Sapsea,' he answered, looking down, 'your
penetration is so acute, your glance into the souls of
your fellow men is so penetrating, that if I was hardy
enough to deny that my name is Poker, what would it
avail me?'</p>

<p>"I don't know that I had quite exactly made out to
a fraction that his name <i>was</i> Poker, but I daresay I had
been pretty near doing it.</p>

<p>"'Well, well,' said I, trying to put him at his ease
by nodding my head in a soothing way. 'Your
name is Poker, and there is no harm in being named
Poker.'</p>

<p>"'Oh Mr. Sapsea!' cried the young man, in a very
well-behaved manner. 'Bless you for those words!'
He then, as if ashamed of having given way to his
feelings, looked down again.</p>

<p>"'Come, Poker,' said I, 'let me hear more about
you. Tell me. Where are you going to, Poker? and
where do you come from?'</p>

<p>"'Ah Mr. Sapsea!' exclaimed the young man.
'Disguise from you is impossible. You know already
that I come from somewhere, and am going somewhere
else. If I was to deny it, what would it avail me?'</p>

<p>"'Then don't deny it,' was my remark.</p>

<p>"'Or,' pursued Poker, in a kind of despondent rapture,
'or if I was to deny that I came to this town to see
and hear you sir, what would it avail me? Or if I was
to deny&mdash;&mdash;'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_477" id="Page_3_477">[477]</a></span>"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Objection</span> has been taken to this biography as likely
to disappoint its readers in not making them "talk to
Dickens as Boswell makes them talk to Johnson." But
where will the blame lie if a man takes up <i>Pickwick</i> and
is disappointed to find that he is not reading <i>Rasselas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_479" id="Page_3_479">[479]</a></span>?</i>
A book must be judged for what it aims to be, and not
for what it cannot by possibility be. I suppose so remarkable
an author as Dickens hardly ever lived who
carried so little of authorship into ordinary social intercourse.
Potent as the sway of his writings was over
him, it expressed itself in other ways. Traces or triumphs
of literary labour, displays of conversational or
other personal predominance, were no part of the influence
he exerted over friends. To them he was only the
pleasantest of companions, with whom they forgot that
he had ever written anything, and felt only the charm
which a nature of such capacity for supreme enjoyment
causes every one around it to enjoy. His talk was
unaffected and natural, never bookish in the smallest
degree. He was quite up to the average of well read
men, but as there was no ostentation of it in his writing,
so neither was there in his conversation. This was so
attractive because so keenly observant, and lighted up
with so many touches of humorous fancy; but, with
every possible thing to give relish to it, there were not
many things to bring away.</p>

<p>Of course a book must stand or fall by its contents.
Macaulay said very truly that the place of books in the
public estimation is fixed, not by what is written about
them, but by what is written in them. I offer no complaint
of any remark made upon these volumes, but
there have been some misapprehensions. Though
Dickens bore outwardly so little of the impress of his
writings, they formed the whole of that inner life
which essentially constituted the man; and as in this
respect he was actually, I have thought that his biography
should endeavour to present him. The story of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_480" id="Page_3_480">[480]</a></span>
his books, therefore, at all stages of their progress, and
of the hopes or designs connected with them, was my
first care. With that view, and to give also to the
memoir what was attainable of the value of autobiography,
letters to myself, such as were never addressed
to any other of his correspondents, and covering all
the important incidents in the life to be retraced, were
used with few exceptions exclusively; and though the
exceptions are much more numerous in the present
volume, this general plan has guided me to the end.
Such were my limits indeed, that half even of those
letters had to be put aside; and to have added all such
others as were open to me would have doubled the size
of my book, not contributed to it a new fact of life or
character, and altered materially its design. It would
have been so much lively illustration added to the subject,
but out of place here. The purpose here was to
make Dickens the sole central figure in the scenes revived,
narrator as well as principal actor; and only by
the means employed could consistency or unity be given
to the self-revelation, and the picture made definite and
clear. It is the peculiarity of few men to be to their
most intimate friend neither more nor less than they
are to themselves, but this was true of Dickens; and
what kind or quality of nature such intercourse expressed
in him, of what strength, tenderness, and delicacy
susceptible, of what steady level warmth, of what
daily unresting activity of intellect, of what unbroken
continuity of kindly impulse through the change and
vicissitude of three-and-thirty years, the letters to myself
given in these volumes could alone express.
Gathered from various and differing sources, their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_481" id="Page_3_481">[481]</a></span>
interest could not have been as the interest of these; in
which everything comprised in the successive stages
of a most attractive career is written with unexampled
candour and truthfulness, and set forth in definite
pictures of what he saw and stood in the midst of,
unblurred by vagueness or reserve. Of the charge of
obtruding myself to which their publication has exposed
me, I can only say that I studied nothing so
hard as to suppress my own personality, and have to
regret my ill success where I supposed I had even too
perfectly succeeded. But we have all of us frequent
occasion to say, parodying Mrs. Peachem's remark,
that we are bitter bad judges of ourselves.</p>

<p>The other properties of these letters are quite subordinate
to this main fact that the man who wrote them
is thus perfectly seen in them. But they do not lessen
the estimate of his genius. Admiration rises higher at
the writer's mental forces, who, putting so much of himself
into his work for the public, had still so much overflowing
for such private intercourse. The sunny health
of nature in them is manifest; its largeness, spontaneity,
and manliness; but they have also that which highest
intellects appreciate best. "I have read them," Lord
Russell wrote to me, "with delight and pain. His
heart, his imagination, his qualities of painting what is
noble, and finding diamonds hidden far away, are
greater here than even his works convey to me. How
I lament he was not spared to us longer. I shall have
a fresh grief when he dies in your volumes." Shallower
people are more apt to find other things. If the
bonhommie of a man's genius is obvious to all the
world, there are plenty of knowing ones ready to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_482" id="Page_3_482">[482]</a></span>
the shine out of the genius, to discover that after all
it is not so wonderful, that what is grave in it wants
depth, and the humour has something mechanical.
But it will be difficult even for these to look over letters
so marvellous in the art of reproducing to the sight
what has once been seen, so natural and unstudied in
their wit and fun, and with such a constant well-spring
of sprightly runnings of speech in them, point of epigram,
ingenuity of quaint expression, absolute freedom
from every touch of affectation, and to believe that the
source of this man's humour, or of whatever gave
wealth to his genius, was other than habitual, unbounded,
and resistless.</p>

<p>There is another consideration of some importance.
Sterne did not more incessantly fall back from his
works upon himself than Dickens did, and undoubtedly
one of the impressions left by the letters is that of the
intensity and tenacity with which he recognized, realized,
contemplated, cultivated, and thoroughly enjoyed,
his own individuality in even its most trivial manifestations.
But if any one is led to ascribe this to self-esteem,
to a narrow exclusiveness, or to any other
invidious form of egotism, let him correct the impression
by observing how Dickens bore himself amid the
universal blazing-up of America, at the beginning and
at the end of his career. Of his hearty, undisguised,
and unmistakeable enjoyment of his astonishing and
indeed quite bewildering popularity, there can be as
little doubt as that there is not a particle of vanity in
it, any more than of false modesty or grimace.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> While<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_483" id="Page_3_483">[483]</a></span>
realizing fully the fact of it, and the worth of the fact,
there is not in his whole being a fibre that answers
falsely to the charmer's voice. Few men in the world,
one fancies, could have gone through such grand displays
of fireworks, not merely with so marvellous an
absence of what the French call <i>pose</i>, but unsoiled by
the smoke of a cracker. No man's strong individuality
was ever so free from conceit.</p>

<p>Other personal incidents and habits, and especially
some matters of opinion of grave importance, will help
to make his character better known. Much questioning
followed a brief former reference to his religious
belief, but, inconsistent or illogical as the conduct
described may be, there is nothing to correct or to
modify in my statement of it;<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> and, to what otherwise
appeared to be in doubt, explicit answer will be
afforded by a letter, written upon the youngest of his
children leaving home in September 1868 to join his
brother in Australia, than which none worthier appears
in his story. "I write this note to-day because your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_484" id="Page_3_484">[484]</a></span>
going away is much upon my mind, and because I want
you to have a few parting words from me, to think of
now and then at quiet times. I need not tell you that
I love you dearly, and am very, very sorry in my heart
to part with you. But this life is half made up of partings,
and these pains must be borne. It is my comfort
and my sincere conviction that you are going to
try the life for which you are best fitted. I think its
freedom and wildness more suited to you than any experiment
in a study or office would have been; and
without that training, you could have followed no other
suitable occupation. What you have always wanted until
now, has been a set, steady, constant purpose. I therefore
exhort you to persevere in a thorough determination
to do whatever you have to do, as well as you can do it.
I was not so old as you are now, when I first had to win
my food, and to do it out of this determination; and
I have never slackened in it since. Never take a mean
advantage of any one in any transaction, and never be
hard upon people who are in your power. Try to do
to others as you would have them do to you, and do
not be discouraged if they fail sometimes. It is much
better for you that they should fail in obeying the
greatest rule laid down by Our Saviour than that you
should. I put a New Testament among your books for
the very same reasons, and with the very same hopes,
that made me write an easy account of it for you, when
you were a little child. Because it is the best book
that ever was, or will be, known in the world; and because
it teaches you the best lessons by which any
human creature, who tries to be truthful and faithful
to duty, can possibly be guided. As your brothers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_485" id="Page_3_485">[485]</a></span>
have gone away, one by one, I have written to each such
words as I am now writing to you, and have entreated
them all to guide themselves by this Book, putting aside
the interpretations and inventions of Man. You will
remember that you have never at home been harassed
about religious observances, or mere formalities. I
have always been anxious not to weary my children
with such things, before they are old enough to form
opinions respecting them. You will therefore understand
the better that I now most solemnly impress
upon you the truth and beauty of the Christian Religion,
as it came from Christ Himself, and the impossibility
of your going far wrong if you humbly but
heartily respect it. Only one thing more on this
head. The more we are in earnest as to feeling it,
the less we are disposed to hold forth about it. Never
abandon the wholesome practice of saying your own
private prayers, night and morning. I have never
abandoned it myself, and I know the comfort of it. I
hope you will always be able to say in after life, that
you had a kind father. You cannot show your affection
for him so well, or make him so happy, as by doing
your duty." They who most intimately knew Dickens
will know best that every word there is written from
his heart, and is radiant with the truth of his nature.</p>

<p>To the same effect, in the leading matter, he expressed
himself twelve years before, and again the day
before his death; replying in both cases to correspondents
who had addressed him as a public writer. A
clergyman, the Rev. R. H. Davies, had been struck by
the hymn in the Christmas tale of the Wreck of the
Golden Mary (<i>Household Words</i>, 1856). "I beg to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_486" id="Page_3_486">[486]</a></span>
thank you" Dickens answered (Christmas Eve, 1856)
"for your very acceptable letter&mdash;not the less gratifying
to me because I am myself the writer you refer to.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
There cannot be many men, I believe, who have a more
humble veneration for the New Testament, or a more
profound conviction of its all-sufficiency, than I have.
If I am ever (as you tell me I am) mistaken on this
subject, it is because I discountenance all obtrusive
professions of and tradings in religion, as one of the
main causes why real Christianity has been retarded in
this world; and because my observation of life induces
me to hold in unspeakable dread and horror, those unseemly
squabbles about the letter which drive the spirit
out of hundreds of thousands." In precisely similar
tone, to a reader of <i>Edwin Drood</i> (Mr. J. M. Makeham),
who had pointed out to him that his employment
as a figure of speech of a line from Holy Writ in his
tenth chapter might be subject to misconstruction, he
wrote from Gadshill on Wednesday the eighth of June,
1870. "It would be quite inconceivable to me, but
for your letter, that any reasonable reader could possibly
attach a scriptural reference to that passage.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am
truly shocked to find that any reader can make the
mistake. I have always striven in my writings to express
veneration for the life and lessons of our Saviour;
because I feel it; and because I re-wrote that history
for my children&mdash;every one of whom knew it, from
having it repeated to them, long before they could
read, and almost as soon as they could speak. But I have
never made proclamation of this from the house tops."<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_487" id="Page_3_487">[487]</a></span></p>
<p>A dislike of all display was rooted in him; and his
objection to posthumous honours, illustrated by the instructions
in his will, was very strikingly expressed two
years before his death, when Mr. Thomas Fairbairn
asked his help to a proposed recognition of Rajah
Brooke's services by a memorial in Westminster Abbey.
"I am very strongly impelled" (24th of June 1868)
"to comply with any request of yours. But these
posthumous honours of committee, subscriptions, and
Westminster Abbey are so profoundly unsatisfactory in
my eyes that&mdash;plainly&mdash;I would rather have nothing to
do with them in any case. My daughter and her aunt
unite with me in kindest regards to Mrs. Fairbairn, and
I hope you will believe in the possession of mine until
I am quietly buried without any memorial but such as
I have set up in my lifetime." Asked a year later
(August 1869) to say something on the inauguration
of Leigh Hunt's bust at his grave in Kensal-green, he
told the committee that he had a very strong objection
to speech-making beside graves. "I do not expect or
wish my feelings in this wise to guide other men; still,
it is so serious with me, and the idea of ever being the
subject of such a ceremony myself is so repugnant to
my soul, that I must decline to officiate."</p>

<p>His aversion to every form of what is called patronage
of literature<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> was part of the same feeling. A few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_488" id="Page_3_488">[488]</a></span>
months earlier a Manchester gentleman<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> wrote for his
support to such a scheme. "I beg to be excused," was
his reply, "from complying with the request you do me
the honour to prefer, simply because I hold the opinion
that there is a great deal too much patronage in England.
The better the design, the less (as I think)
should it seek such adventitious aid, and the more composedly
should it rest on its own merits." This was
the belief Southey held; it extended to the support by
way of patronage given by such societies as the Literary
Fund, which Southey also strongly resisted; and it
survived the failure of the Guild whereby it was hoped
to establish a system of self-help, under which men engaged
in literary pursuits might be as proud to receive
as to give. Though there was no project of his life
into which he flung himself with greater eagerness than
the Guild, it was not taken up by the class it was meant
to benefit, and every renewed exertion more largely
added to the failure. There is no room in these pages
for the story, which will add its chapter some day to
the vanity of human wishes; but a passage from a letter
to Bulwer Lytton at its outset will be some measure
of the height from which the writer fell, when all hope
for what he had so set his heart upon ceased. "I do
devoutly believe that this plan, carried by the support
which I trust will be given to it, will change the status
of the literary man in England, and make a revolution
in his position which no government, no power on earth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_489" id="Page_3_489">[489]</a></span>
but his own, could ever effect. I have implicit confidence
in the scheme&mdash;so splendidly begun&mdash;if we carry
it out with a stedfast energy. I have a strong conviction
that we hold in our hands the peace and honour
of men of letters for centuries to come, and that you
are destined to be their best and most enduring benefactor.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Oh what a procession of new years may
walk out of all this for the class we belong to, after we
are dust."</p>

<p>These views about patronage did not make him more
indulgent to the clamour with which it is so often invoked
for the ridiculously small. "You read that life
of Clare?" he wrote (15th of August 1865). "Did
you ever see such preposterous exaggeration of small
claims? And isn't it expressive, the perpetual prating
of him in the book as <i>the Poet?</i> So another Incompetent
used to write to the Literary Fund when I was on
the committee: 'This leaves the Poet at his divine mission
in a corner of the single room. The Poet's father
is wiping his spectacles. The Poet's mother is weaving'&mdash;Yah!'"
He was equally intolerant of every
magnificent proposal that should render the literary
man independent of the bookseller, and he sharply
criticized even a compromise to replace the half-profits
system by one of royalties on copies sold. "What
does it come to?" he remarked of an ably-written
pamphlet in which this was urged (10th of November
1866): "what is the worth of the remedy after all?
You and I know very well that in nine cases out of ten
the author is at a disadvantage with the publisher because
the publisher has capital and the author has not.
We know perfectly well that in nine cases out of ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_490" id="Page_3_490">[490]</a></span>
money is advanced by the publisher before the book is
producible&mdash;often, long before. No young or unsuccessful
author (unless he were an amateur and an independent
gentleman) would make a bargain for having
that royalty, to-morrow, if he could have a certain sum
of money, or an advance of money. The author who
could command that bargain, could command it to-morrow,
or command anything else. For the less fortunate
or the less able, I make bold to say&mdash;with some
knowledge of the subject, as a writer who made a publisher's
fortune long before he began to share in the
real profits of his books&mdash;that if the publishers met
next week, and resolved henceforth to make this royalty
bargain and no other, it would be an enormous hardship
and misfortune because the authors could not live while
they wrote. The pamphlet seems to me just another
example of the old philosophical chess-playing, with
human beings for pieces. 'Don't want money.' 'Be
careful to be born with means, and have a banker's account.'
'Your publisher will settle with you, at such
and such long periods according to the custom of his
trade, and you will settle with your butcher and baker
weekly, in the meantime, by drawing cheques as I do.'
'You must be sure not to want money, and then I have
worked it out for you splendidly.'"</p>

<p>Less has been said in this work than might perhaps
have been wished, of the way in which his editorship
of <i>Household Words</i> and <i>All the Year Round</i> was discharged.
It was distinguished above all by liberality;
and a scrupulous consideration and delicacy, evinced
by him to all his contributors, was part of the esteem
in which he held literature itself. It was said in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_491" id="Page_3_491">[491]</a></span>
newspaper after his death, evidently by one of his contributors,
that he always brought the best out of a man
by encouragement and appreciation; that he liked his
writers to feel unfettered; and that his last reply to a
proposition for a series of articles had been: "Whatever
you see your way to, I will see mine to, and we
know and understand each other well enough to make
the best of these conditions." Yet the strong feeling
of personal responsibility was always present in his
conduct of both journals; and varied as the contents
of a number might be, and widely apart the writers, a
certain individuality of his own was never absent. He
took immense pains (as indeed was his habit about
everything) with numbers in which he had written
nothing; would often accept a paper from a young or
unhandy contributor, because of some single notion in
it which he thought it worth rewriting for; and in this
way, or by helping generally to give strength and attractiveness
to the work of others, he grudged no
trouble.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> "I have had a story" he wrote (22nd of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_492" id="Page_3_492">[492]</a></span>
June 1856) "to hack and hew into some form for
<i>Household Words</i> this morning, which has taken me
four hours of close attention. And I am perfectly
addled by its horrible want of continuity after all, and
the dreadful spectacle I have made of the proofs&mdash;which
look like an inky fishing-net." A few lines
from another letter will show the difficulties in which
he was often involved by the plan he adopted for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_493" id="Page_3_493">[493]</a></span>
Christmas numbers, of putting within a framework by
himself a number of stories by separate writers to whom
the leading notion had before been severally sent.
"As yet" (25th of November 1859), "not a story has
come to me in the least belonging to the idea (the
simplest in the world; which I myself described in
writing, in the most elaborate manner); and everyone
of them turns, by a strange fatality, on a criminal
trial!" It had all to be set right by him, and editorship
on such terms was not a sinecure.</p>

<p>It had its pleasures as well as pains, however, and
the greatest was when he fancied he could descry unusual
merit in any writer. A letter will give one
instance for illustration of many; the lady to whom it
was addressed, admired under her assumed name of
Holme Lee, having placed it at my disposal. (Folkestone:
14th of August 1855.) "I read your tale with
the strongest emotion, and with a very exalted admiration
of the great power displayed in it. Both in
severity and tenderness I thought it masterly. It
moved me more than I can express to you. I wrote
to Mr. Wills that it had completely unsettled me for
the day, and that by whomsoever it was written, I felt
the highest respect for the mind that had produced it.
It so happened that I had been for some days at work
upon a character externally like the Aunt. And it was
very strange to me indeed to observe how the two
people seemed to be near to one another at first, and
then turned off on their own ways so wide asunder. I
told Mr. Wills that I was not sure whether I could
have prevailed upon myself to present to a large audience
the terrible consideration of hereditary madness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_494" id="Page_3_494">[494]</a></span>
when it was reasonably probable that there must be
many&mdash;or some&mdash;among them whom it would awfully,
because personally, address. But I was not obliged to
ask myself the question, inasmuch as the length of the
story rendered it unavailable for <i>Household Words</i>. I
speak of its length in reference to that publication
only; relatively to what is told in it, I would not spare
a page of your manuscript. Experience shows me that
a story in four portions is best suited to the peculiar
requirements of such a journal, and I assure you it will
be an uncommon satisfaction to me if this correspondence
should lead to your enrolment among its contributors.
But my strong and sincere conviction of
the vigour and pathos of this beautiful tale, is quite
apart from, and not to be influenced by, any ulterior
results. You had no existence to me when I read it.
The actions and sufferings of the characters affected me
by their own force and truth, and left a profound impression
on me."<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The experience there mentioned
did not prevent him from admitting into his later
periodical, <i>All the Year Round</i>, longer serial stories
published with the names of known writers; and to
his own interference with these he properly placed
limits. "When one of my literary brothers does me
the honour to undertake such a task, I hold that he
executes it on his own personal responsibility, and for
the sustainment of his own reputation; and I do not
consider myself at liberty to exercise that control over
his text which I claim as to other contributions." Nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_495" id="Page_3_495">[495]</a></span>
had he any greater pleasure, even in these cases, than
to help younger novelists to popularity. "You asked
me about new writers last night. If you will read
<i>Kissing the Rod</i>, a book I have read to-day, you will
not find it hard to take an interest in the author of
such a book." That was Mr. Edmund Yates, in whose
literary successes he took the greatest interest himself,
and with whom he continued to the last an intimate
personal intercourse which had dated from kindness
shown at a very trying time. "I think" he wrote of
another of his contributors, Mr. Percy Fitzgerald, for
whom he had also much personal liking, and of whose
powers he thought highly, "you will find <i>Fatal Zero</i> a
very curious bit of mental development, deepening as
the story goes on into a picture not more startling than
true." My mention of these pleasures of editorship
shall close with what I think to him was the greatest.
He gave to the world, while yet the name of the writer
was unknown to him, the pure and pathetic verse of
Adelaide Procter. "In the spring of the year 1853 I
observed a short poem among the proffered contributions,
very different, as I thought, from the shoal of
verses perpetually setting through the office of such a
periodical."<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> The contributions had been large and
frequent under an assumed name, when at Christmas
1854 he discovered that Miss Mary Berwick was the
daughter of his old and dear friend Barry Cornwall.</p>

<p>But periodical writing is not without its drawbacks,
and its effect on Dickens, who engaged in it largely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_496" id="Page_3_496">[496]</a></span>
from time to time, was observable in the increased impatience
of allusion to national institutions and conventional
distinctions to be found in his later books.
Party divisions he cared for less and less as life moved
on; but the decisive, peremptory, dogmatic style, into
which a habit of rapid remark on topics of the day
will betray the most candid and considerate commentator,
displayed its influence, perhaps not always
consciously to himself, in the underlying tone of bitterness
that runs through the books which followed <i>Copperfield</i>.
The resentment against remediable wrongs
is as praiseworthy in them as in the earlier tales; but
the exposure of Chancery abuses, administrative incompetence,
politico-economic shortcomings, and social
flunkeyism, in <i>Bleak House</i>, <i>Little Dorrit</i>, <i>Hard
Times</i>, and <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, would not have been
made less odious by the cheerier tone that had struck
with much sharper effect at prison abuses, parish
wrongs, Yorkshire schools, and hypocritical humbug,
in <i>Pickwick</i>, <i>Oliver Twist</i>, <i>Nickleby</i>, and <i>Chuzzlewit</i>.
It will be remembered of him always that he desired to
set right what was wrong, that he held no abuse to be
unimprovable, that he left none of the evils named
exactly as he found them, and that to influences drawn
from his writings were due not a few of the salutary
changes which marked the age in which he lived; but
anger does not improve satire, and it gave latterly,
from the causes named, too aggressive a form to what,
after all, was but a very wholesome hatred of the cant
that everything English is perfect, and that to call a
thing <i>un</i>English is to doom it to abhorred extinction.</p>

<p>"I have got an idea for occasional papers in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_497" id="Page_3_497">[497]</a></span> <i>Household Words</i>
called the Member for Nowhere. They
will contain an account of his views, votes, and
speeches; and I think of starting with his speeches on
the Sunday question. He is a member of the Government
of course. The moment they found such a
member in the House, they felt that he must be dragged
(by force, if necessary) into the Cabinet." "I give
it up reluctantly," he wrote afterwards, "and with it
my hope to have made every man in England feel
something of the contempt for the House of Commons
that I have. We shall never begin to do anything
until the sentiment is universal." That was in August
1854; and the break-down in the Crimea that winter
much embittered his radicalism. "I am hourly
strengthened in my old belief," he wrote (3rd of
February 1855) "that our political aristocracy and our
tuft-hunting are the death of England. In all this
business I don't see a gleam of hope. As to the popular
spirit, it has come to be so entirely separated from
the Parliament and Government, and so perfectly
apathetic about them both, that I seriously think it a
most portentous sign." A couple of months later:
"I have rather a bright idea, I think, for <i>Household
Words</i> this morning: a fine little bit of satire: an
account of an Arabic MS. lately discovered very like
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>&mdash;called the Thousand and One
Humbugs. With new versions of the best known
stories." This also had to be given up, and is only
mentioned as another illustration of his political discontents
and of their connection with his journal-work.
The influences from his early life which unconsciously
strengthened them in certain social directions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_498" id="Page_3_498">[498]</a></span>
has been hinted at, and of his absolute sincerity in the
matter there can be no doubt. The mistakes of
Dickens were never such as to cast a shade on his
integrity. What he said with too much bitterness, in
his heart he believed; and had, alas! too much ground
for believing. "A country," he wrote (27th of April
1855) "which is discovered to be in this tremendous
condition as to its war affairs; with an enormous black
cloud of poverty in every town which is spreading and
deepening every hour, and not one man in two thousand
knowing anything about, or even believing in, its
existence; with a non-working aristocracy, and a silent
parliament, and everybody for himself and nobody for
the rest; this is the prospect, and I think it a very
deplorable one." Admirably did he say, of a notorious
enquiry at that time: "O what a fine aspect of
political economy it is, that the noble professors of the
science on the adulteration committee should have
tried to make Adulteration a question of Supply and
Demand! We shall never get to the Millennium, sir,
by the rounds of that ladder; and I, for one, won't
hold by the skirts of that Great Mogul of impostors,
Master M'Culloch!" Again he wrote (30th of September
1855): "I really am serious in thinking&mdash;and I
have given as painful consideration to the subject as a
man with children to live and suffer after him can
honestly give to it&mdash;that representative government is
become altogether a failure with us, that the English
gentilities and subserviences render the people unfit for
it, and that the whole thing has broken down since
that great seventeenth-century time, and has no hope
in it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_499" id="Page_3_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p>With the good sense that still overruled all his
farthest extremes of opinion he yet never thought of
parliament for himself. He could not mend matters,
and for him it would have been a false position. The
people of the town of Reading and others applied to
him during the first half of his life, and in the last
half some of the Metropolitan constituencies. To one
of the latter a reply is before me in which he says: "I
declare that as to all matters on the face of this teeming
earth, it appears to me that the House of Commons and
Parliament altogether is become just the dreariest failure
and nuisance that ever bothered this much-bothered
world." To a private enquiry of apparently about the
same date he replied: "I have thoroughly satisfied
myself, having often had occasion to consider the question,
that I can be far more usefully and independently
employed in my chosen sphere of action than I could
hope to be in the House of Commons; and I believe
that no consideration would induce me to become a
member of that extraordinary assembly." Finally,
upon a reported discussion in Finsbury whether or
not he should be invited to sit for that borough, he
promptly wrote (November 1861): "It may save some
trouble if you will kindly confirm a sensible gentleman
who doubted at that meeting whether I was quite the
man for Finsbury. I am not at all the sort of man;
for I believe nothing would induce me to offer myself
as a parliamentary representative of that place, or of
any other under the sun." The only direct attempt
to join a political agitation was his speech at Drury-lane
for administrative reform, and he never repeated
it. But every movement for practical social reforms, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_500" id="Page_3_500">[500]</a></span>
obtain more efficient sanitary legislation, to get the
best compulsory education practicable for the poor,
and to better the condition of labouring people, he
assisted earnestly to his last hour; and the readiness
with which he took the chair at meetings having such
objects in view, the help he gave to important societies
working in beneficent ways for themselves or the community,
and the power and attractiveness of his oratory,
made him one of the forces of the time. His speeches
derived singular charm from the buoyancy of his perfect
self-possession, and to this he added the advantages
of a person and manner which had become as familiar
and as popular as his books. The most miscellaneous
assemblages listened to him as to a personal friend.</p>

<p>Two incidents at the close of his life will show what
upon these matters his latest opinions were. At the
great Liverpool dinner after his country readings in
1869, over which Lord Dufferin eloquently presided,
he replied to a remonstrance from Lord Houghton
against his objection to entering public life,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> that when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_501" id="Page_3_501">[501]</a></span>
he took literature for his profession he intended it to
be his sole profession; that at that time it did not
appear to him to be so well understood in England, as
in some other countries, that literature was a dignified
profession by which any man might stand or fall; and
he resolved that in his person at least it should stand
"by itself, of itself, and for itself;" a bargain which
"no consideration on earth would now induce him to
break." Here however he probably failed to see the
entire meaning of Lord Houghton's regret, which
would seem to have been meant to say, in more polite
form, that to have taken some part in public affairs
might have shown him the difficulty in a free state of
providing remedies very swiftly for evils of long growth.
A half reproach from the same quarter for alleged unkindly
sentiments to the House of Lords, he repelled
with vehement warmth; insisting on his great regard
for individual members, and declaring that there was
no man in England he respected more in his public
capacity, loved more in his private capacity, or from
whom he had received more remarkable proofs of his
honour and love of literature, than Lord Russell.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_502" id="Page_3_502">[502]</a></span>
Birmingham shortly after, discoursing on education to
the members of the Midland Institute, he told them
they should value self-improvement not because it led
to fortune but because it was good and right in itself;
counselled them in regard to it that Genius was not
worth half so much as Attention, or the art of taking
an immense deal of pains, which he declared to be, in
every study and pursuit, the one sole, safe, certain,
remunerative quality; and summed up briefly his political
belief.&mdash;"My faith in the people governing is, on
the whole, infinitesimal; my faith in the People governed
is, on the whole, illimitable." This he afterwards
(January 1870) explained to mean that he had
very little confidence in the people who govern us
("with a small p"), and very great confidence in the
People whom they govern ("with a large P"). "My
confession being shortly and elliptically stated, was,
with no evil intention I am absolutely sure, in some
quarters inversely explained." He added that his
political opinions had already been not obscurely stated
in an "idle book or two"; and he reminded his
hearers that he was the inventor "of a certain fiction
called the Circumlocution Office, said to be very extravagant,
but which I <i>do</i> see rather frequently quoted
as if there were grains of truth at the bottom of it."
It may nevertheless be suspected, with some confidence,
that the construction of his real meaning was not far
wrong which assumed it as the condition precedent to
his illimitable faith, that the people, even with the big
P, should be "governed." It was his constant complaint
that, being much in want of government, they
had only sham governors; and he had returned from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_503" id="Page_3_503">[503]</a></span>
his second American visit, as he came back from his
first, indisposed to believe that the political problem
had been solved in the land of the free. From the
pages of his last book, the bitterness of allusion so
frequent in the books just named was absent altogether;
and his old unaltered wish to better what was bad in
English institutions, carried with it no desire to replace
them by new ones.</p>

<p>In a memoir published shortly after his death there
appeared this statement. "For many years past Her
Majesty the Queen has taken the liveliest interest in
Mr. Dickens's literary labours, and has frequently expressed
a desire for an interview with him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This
interview took place on the 9th of April, when he
received her commands to attend her at Buckingham
Palace, and was introduced by his friend Mr. Arthur
Helps, the clerk of the Privy Council.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Since our
author's decease the journal with which he was formerly
connected has said: 'The Queen was ready to confer
any distinction which Mr. Dickens's known views and
tastes would permit him to accept, and after more than
one title of honour had been declined, Her Majesty
desired that he would, at least, accept a place in her
Privy Council.'" As nothing is too absurd<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> for belief,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_504" id="Page_3_504">[504]</a></span>
it will not be superfluous to say that Dickens knew
of no such desire on her Majesty's part; and though all
the probabilities are on the side of his unwillingness to
accept any title or place of honour, certainly none was
offered to him.</p>

<p>It had been hoped to obtain her Majesty's name for
the Jerrold performances in 1857, but, being a public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_505" id="Page_3_505">[505]</a></span>
effort in behalf of an individual, assent would have involved
"either perpetual compliance or the giving of
perpetual offence." Her Majesty however then sent,
through Colonel Phipps, a request to Dickens that he
would select a room in the palace, do what he would
with it, and let her see the play there. "I said to Col.
Phipps thereupon" (21st of June 1857) "that the idea
was not quite new to me; that I did not feel easy as to
the social position of my daughters, &amp;c. at a Court
under those circumstances; and that I would beg her
Majesty to excuse me, if any other way of her seeing
the play could be devised. To this Phipps said he had
not thought of the objection, but had not the slightest
doubt I was right. I then proposed that the Queen
should come to the Gallery of Illustration a week before
the subscription night, and should have the room entirely
at her own disposal, and should invite her own
company. This, with the good sense that seems to
accompany her good nature on all occasions, she resolved
within a few hours to do." The effect of the
performance was a great gratification. "My gracious
sovereign" (5th of July 1857) "was so pleased that she
sent round begging me to go and see her and accept
her thanks. I replied that I was in my Farce dress,
and must beg to be excused. Whereupon she sent
again, saying that the dress 'could not be so ridiculous
as that,' and repeating the request. I sent my duty in
reply, but again hoped her Majesty would have the
kindness to excuse my presenting myself in a costume
and appearance that were not my own. I was mighty
glad to think, when I woke this morning, that I had
carried the point."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_506" id="Page_3_506">[506]</a></span></p>

<p>The opportunity of presenting himself in his own
costume did not arrive till the year of his death, another
effort meanwhile made having proved also unsuccessful.
"I was put into a state of much perplexity on
Sunday" (30th of March 1858). "I don't know who
had spoken to my informant, but it seems that the
Queen is bent upon hearing the <i>Carol</i> read, and has
expressed her desire to bring it about without offence;
hesitating about the manner of it, in consequence of
my having begged to be excused from going to her
when she sent for me after the <i>Frozen Deep</i>. I parried
the thing as well as I could; but being asked to be
prepared with a considerate and obliging answer, as it
was known the request would be preferred, I said,
'Well! I supposed Col. Phipps would speak to me
about it, and if it were he who did so, I should assure
him of my desire to meet any wish of her Majesty's,
and should express my hope that she would indulge me
by making one of some audience or other&mdash;for I
thought an audience necessary to the effect.' Thus it
stands: but it bothers me." The difficulty was not
surmounted, but her Majesty's continued interest in
the <i>Carol</i> was shown by her purchase of a copy of it
with Dickens's autograph at Thackeray's sale;<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_507" id="Page_3_507">[507]</a></span>
last there came, in the year of his death, the interview
with the author whose popularity dated from her accession,
whose books had entertained larger numbers of
her subjects than those of any other contemporary
writer, and whose genius will be counted among the
glories of her reign. Accident led to it. Dickens had
brought with him from America some large and striking
photographs of the Battle Fields of the Civil War,
which the Queen, having heard of them through Mr.
Helps, expressed a wish to look at. Dickens sent them
at once; and went afterwards to Buckingham Palace
with Mr. Helps, at her Majesty's request, that she
might see and thank him in person.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of March, not April. "Come
now sir, this is an interesting matter, do favour us with
it," was the cry of Johnson's friends after his conversation
with George the Third; and again and again the
story was told to listeners ready to make marvels of its
commonplaces. But the romance even of the eighteenth
century in such a matter is clean gone out of the
nineteenth. Suffice it that the Queen's kindness left a
strong impression on Dickens. Upon her Majesty's
regret not to have heard his Readings, Dickens intimated
that they were become now a thing of the past,
while he acknowledged gratefully her Majesty's compliment
in regard to them. She spoke to him of the
impression made upon her by his acting in the <i>Frozen
Deep;</i> and on his stating, in reply to her enquiry, that
the little play had not been very successful on the public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_508" id="Page_3_508">[508]</a></span>
stage, said this did not surprise her, since it no longer
had the advantage of his performance in it. Then
arose a mention of some alleged discourtesy shown to
Prince Arthur in New York, and he begged her Majesty
not to confound the true Americans of that city with
the Fenian portion of its Irish population; on which
she made the quiet comment that she was convinced
the people about the Prince had made too much of the
affair. He related to her the story of President Lincoln's
dream on the night before his murder. She
asked him to give her his writings, and could she have
them that afternoon? but he begged to be allowed to
send a bound copy. Her Majesty then took from a
table her own book upon the Highlands, with an autograph
inscription "to Charles Dickens"; and, saying
that "the humblest" of writers would be ashamed to
offer it to "one of the greatest" but that Mr. Helps,
being asked to give it, had remarked that it would be
valued most from herself, closed the interview by placing
it in his hands. "Sir," said Johnson, "they may
say what they like of the young King, but Louis the
Fourteenth could not have shown a more refined courtliness";
and Dickens was not disposed to say less of
the young King's granddaughter. That the grateful
impression sufficed to carry him into new ways, I had
immediate proof, coupled with intimation of the still
surviving strength of old memories. "As my sovereign
desires" (26th of March 1870) "that I should attend
the next levee, don't faint with amazement if you see
my name in that unwonted connexion. I have scrupulously
kept myself free for the second of April, in case
you should be accessible." The name appeared at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_509" id="Page_3_509">[509]</a></span>
levee accordingly, his daughter was at the drawing-room
that followed, and Lady Houghton writes to me
"I never saw Mr. Dickens more agreeable than at a
dinner at our house about a fortnight before his death,
when he met the King of the Belgians and the Prince
of Wales at the special desire of the latter." Up to
nearly the hour of dinner, it was doubtful if he could
go. He was suffering from the distress in his foot; and
on arrival at the house, being unable to ascend the
stairs, had to be assisted at once into the dining-room.</p>

<p>The friend who had accompanied Dickens to Buckingham
Palace, writing of him<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> after his death, briefly
but with admirable knowledge and taste, said that he
ardently desired, and confidently looked forward to, a
time when there would be a more intimate union than
exists at present between the different classes in the
state, a union that should embrace alike the highest
and the lowest. This perhaps expresses, as well as a
few words could, what certainly was always at his heart;
and he might have come to think it, when his life was
closing, more possible of realisation some day than he
ever thought it before. The hope of it was on his
friend Talfourd's lips when he died, and his own most
jarring opinions might at last have joined in the effort
to bring about such reconcilement. More on this head
it needs not to say. Whatever may be the objection
to special views held by him, he would, wanting even
the most objectionable, have been less himself. It was
by something of the despot seldom separable from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_510" id="Page_3_510">[510]</a></span>
genius, joined to a truthfulness of nature belonging to
the highest characters, that men themselves of a rare
faculty were attracted to find in Dickens what Sir
Arthur Helps has described, "a man to confide in,
and look up to as a leader, in the midst of any great
peril."</p>

<p>Mr. Layard also held that opinion of him. He was
at Gadshill during the Christmas before Dickens went
for the last time to America, and witnessed one of those
scenes, not infrequent there, in which the master of the
house was pre-eminently at home. They took generally
the form of cricket matches; but this was, to use the
phrase of his friend Bobadil, more popular and diffused;
and of course he rose with the occasion. "The more
you want of the master, the more you'll find in him,"
said the gasman employed about his readings. "Foot-races
for the villagers," he wrote on Christmas Day,
"come off in my field to-morrow. We have been all
hard at work all day, building a course, making countless
flags, and I don't know what else. Layard is chief
commissioner of the domestic police. The country
police predict an immense crowd." There were between
two and three thousand people; and somehow,
by a magical kind of influence, said Layard, Dickens
seemed to have bound every creature present, upon
what honour the creature had, to keep order. What
was the special means used, or the art employed, it
might have been difficult to say; but that was the
result. Writing on New Year's Day, Dickens himself
described it to me. "We had made a very pretty
course, and taken great pains. Encouraged by the
cricket matches experience, I allowed the landlord of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_511" id="Page_3_511">[511]</a></span>
the Falstaff to have a drinking-booth on the ground.
Not to seem to dictate or distrust, I gave all the prizes
(about ten pounds in the aggregate) in money. The
great mass of the crowd were labouring men of all
kinds, soldiers, sailors, and navvies. They did not,
between half-past ten, when we began, and sunset,
displace a rope or a stake; and they left every barrier
and flag as neat as they found it. There was not a
dispute, and there was no drunkenness whatever. I
made them a little speech from the lawn, at the end of
the games, saying that please God we would do it again
next year. They cheered most lustily and dispersed.
The road between this and Chatham was like a Fair all
day; and surely it is a fine thing to get such perfect
behaviour out of a reckless seaport town. Among
other oddities we had a Hurdle Race for Strangers.
One man (he came in second) ran 120 yards and leaped
over ten hurdles, in twenty seconds, <i>with a pipe in his
mouth, and smoking it all the time</i>. 'If it hadn't been
for your pipe,' I said to him at the winning-post, 'you
would have been first.' 'I beg your pardon, sir,' he
answered, 'but if it hadn't been for my pipe, I should
have been nowhere.'" The close of the letter had
this rather memorable announcement. "The sale of
the Christmas number was, yesterday evening, 255,380."
Would it be absurd to say that there is something in
such a vast popularity in itself electrical, and, though
founded on books, felt where books never reach?</p>

<p>It is also very noticeable that what would have constituted
the strength of Dickens if he had entered public
life, the attractive as well as the commanding side of
his nature, was that which kept him most within the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_512" id="Page_3_512">[512]</a></span>
circle of home pursuits and enjoyments. This "better
part" of him had now long survived that sorrowful
period of 1857-8, when, for reasons which I have not
thought myself free to suppress, a vaguely disturbed
feeling for the time took possession of him, and occurrences
led to his adoption of other pursuits than those
to which till then he had given himself exclusively. It
was a sad interval in his life; but, though changes incident
to the new occupation then taken up remained,
and with them many adverse influences which brought
his life prematurely to a close, it was, with any reference
to that feeling, an interval only; and the dominant
impression of the later years, as of the earlier, takes
the marvellously domestic home-loving shape in which
also the strength of his genius is found. It will not do
to draw round any part of such a man too hard a line,
and the writer must not be charged with inconsistency
who says that Dickens's childish sufferings,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> and the
sense they burnt into him of the misery of loneliness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_513" id="Page_3_513">[513]</a></span>
and a craving for joys of home, though they led to
what was weakest in him, led also to what was greatest.
It was his defect as well as his merit in maturer life not
to be able to live alone. When the fancies of his novels
were upon him and he was under their restless influence,
though he often talked of shutting himself up in out
of the way solitary places, he never went anywhere
unaccompanied by members of his family. His habits
of daily life he carried with him wherever he went. In
Albaro and Genoa, at Lausanne and Geneva, in Paris
and Boulogne, his ways were as entirely those of home
as in London and Broadstairs. If it is the property of
a domestic nature to be personally interested in every
detail, the smallest as the greatest, of the four walls
within which one lives, then no man had it so essentially
as Dickens. No man was so inclined naturally
to derive his happiness from home concerns. Even
the kind of interest in a house which is commonly
confined to women, he was full of. Not to speak of
changes of importance, there was not an additional
hook put up wherever he inhabited, without his knowledge,
or otherwise than as part of some small ingenuity
of his own. Nothing was too minute for his personal
superintendence. Whatever might be in hand, theatricals
for the little children, entertainments for those of
larger growth, cricket matches, dinners, field sports,
from the first new year's eve dance in Doughty Street
to the last musical party in Hyde Park Place, he was
the centre and soul of it. He did not care to take
measure of its greater or less importance. It was
enough that a thing was to do, to be worth his while
to do it as if there was nothing else to be done in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_514" id="Page_3_514">[514]</a></span>
world. The cry of Laud and Wentworth was his, alike
in small and great things; and to no man was more
applicable the German "Echt," which expresses reality
as well as thoroughness. The usual result followed,
in all his homes, of an absolute reliance on him for
everything. Under every difficulty, and in every
emergency, his was the encouraging influence, the
bright and ready help. In illness, whether of the
children or any of the servants, he was better than a
doctor. He was so full of resource, for which every
one eagerly turned to him, that his mere presence in
the sick-room was a healing influence, as if nothing
could fail if he were only there. So that at last,
when, all through the awful night which preceded his
departure, he lay senseless in the room where he had
fallen, the stricken and bewildered ones who tended
him found it impossible to believe that what they saw
before them alone was left, or to shut out wholly the
strange wild hope that he might again be suddenly
among them <i>like</i> himself, and revive what they could
not connect, even then, with death's despairing helplessness.</p>

<p>It was not a feeling confined to the relatives whom
he had thus taught to have such exclusive dependence
on him. Among the consolations addressed to those
mourners came words from one whom in life he had
most honoured, and who also found it difficult to connect
him with death, or to think that he should never
see that blithe face anymore. "It is almost thirty
years," Mr. Carlyle wrote, "since my acquaintance
with him began; and on my side, I may say, every
new meeting ripened it into more and more clear discernment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_515" id="Page_3_515">[515]</a></span>
of his rare and great worth as a brother man:
a most cordial, sincere, clear-sighted, quietly decisive,
just and loving man: till at length he had grown to
such a recognition with me as I have rarely had for
any man of my time. This I can tell you three, for it
is true and will be welcome to you: to others less concerned
I had as soon <i>not</i> speak on such a subject." "I
am profoundly sorry, for <i>you</i>," Mr. Carlyle at the same
time wrote to me; "and indeed for myself and for us
all. It is an event world-wide; a <i>unique</i> of talents
suddenly extinct; and has 'eclipsed,' we too may say,
'the harmless gaiety of nations.' No death since 1866
has fallen on me with such a stroke. No literary man's
hitherto ever did. The good, the gentle, high-gifted,
ever-friendly, noble Dickens,&mdash;every inch of him an
Honest Man."</p>

<p>Of his ordinary habits of activity I have spoken, and
they were doubtless carried too far. In youth it was
all well, but he did not make allowance for years. This
has had abundant illustration, but will admit of a few
words more. To all men who do much, rule and order
are essential; method in everything was Dickens's peculiarity;
and between breakfast and luncheon, with
rare exceptions, was his time of work. But his daily
walks were less of rule than of enjoyment and necessity.
In the midst of his writing they were indispensable, and
especially, as it has often been shown, at night. Mr.
Sala is an authority on London streets, and, in the
eloquent and generous tribute he was among the first
to offer to his memory, has described himself encountering
Dickens in the oddest places and most inclement
weather, in Ratcliffe-highway, on Haverstock-hill, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_516" id="Page_3_516">[516]</a></span>
Camberwell-green, in Gray's-inn-lane, in the Wandsworth-road,
at Hammersmith Broadway, in Norton
Folgate, and at Kensal New Town. "A hansom
whirled you by the Bell and Horns at Brompton, and
there he was striding, as with seven-league boots, seemingly
in the direction of North-end, Fulham. The
Metropolitan Railway sent you forth at Lisson-grove,
and you met him plodding speedily towards the Yorkshire
Stingo. He was to be met rapidly skirting the
grim brick wall of the prison in Coldbath-fields, or
trudging along the Seven Sisters-road at Holloway, or
bearing, under a steady press of sail, underneath Highgate
Archway, or pursuing the even tenor of his way
up the Vauxhall-bridge-road." But he was equally at
home in the intricate byways of narrow streets and in
the lengthy thoroughfares. Wherever there was "matter
to be heard and learned," in back streets behind
Holborn, in Borough courts and passages, in city wharfs
or alleys, about the poorer lodging-houses, in prisons,
workhouses, ragged-schools, police-courts, rag-shops,
chandlers' shops, and all sorts of markets for the poor,
he carried his keen observation and untiring study. "I
was among the Italian Boys from 12 to 2 this morning,"
says one of his letters. "I am going out to-night in
their boat with the Thames Police," says another. It
was the same when he was in Italy or Switzerland, as
we have seen; and when, in later life, he was in French
provincial places. "I walk miles away into the country,
and you can scarcely imagine by what deserted ramparts
and silent little cathedral closes, or how I pass over
rusty drawbridges and stagnant ditches out of and into
the decaying town." For several consecutive years I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_517" id="Page_3_517">[517]</a></span>
accompanied him every Christmas Eve to see the marketings
for Christmas down the road from Aldgate to
Bow; and he had a surprising fondness for wandering
about in poor neighbourhoods on Christmas-day, past
the areas of shabby genteel houses in Somers or Kentish
Towns, and watching the dinners preparing or coming
in. But the temptations of his country life led him on
to excesses in walking. "Coming in just now," he
wrote in his third year at Gadshill, "after twelve miles
in the rain, I was so wet that I have had to change and
get my feet into warm water before I could do anything."
Again, two years later: "A south-easter
blowing, enough to cut one's throat. I am keeping
the house for my cold, as I did yesterday. But the
remedy is so new to me, that I doubt if it does me
half the good of a dozen miles in the snow. So, if
this mode of treatment fails to-day, I shall try that
to-morrow." He tried it perhaps too often. In the
winter of 1865 he first had the attack in his left foot
which materially disabled his walking-power for the
rest of his life. He supposed its cause to be overwalking
in the snow, and that this had aggravated the suffering
is very likely; but, read by the light of what
followed, it may now be presumed to have had more
serious origin. It recurred at intervals, before America,
without any such provocation; in America it came
back, not when he had most been walking in the snow,
but when nervous exhaustion was at its worst with him;
after America, it became prominent on the eve of the
occurrence at Preston which first revealed the progress
that disease had been making in the vessels of the brain;
and in the last year of his life, as will immediately be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_518" id="Page_3_518">[518]</a></span>
seen, it was a constant trouble and most intense suffering,
extending then gravely to his left hand also, which
had before been only slightly affected.</p>

<p>It was from a letter of the 21st of February 1865 I
first learnt that he was suffering tortures from a "frost-bitten"
foot, and ten days later brought more detailed
account. "I got frost-bitten by walking continually
in the snow, and getting wet in the feet daily. My
boots hardened and softened, hardened and softened,
my left foot swelled, and I still forced the boot on;
sat in it to write, half the day; walked in it through
the snow, the other half; forced the boot on again
next morning; sat and walked again; and being
accustomed to all sorts of changes in my feet, took no
heed. At length, going out as usual, I fell lame on the
walk, and had to limp home dead lame, through the
snow, for the last three miles&mdash;to the remarkable terror,
by-the-bye, of the two big dogs." The dogs were
Turk and Linda. Boisterous companions as they
always were, the sudden change in him brought them
to a stand-still; and for the rest of the journey they
crept by the side of their master as slowly as he did,
never turning from him. He was greatly moved by
the circumstance, and often referred to it. Turk's
look upward to his face was one of sympathy as well as
fear, he said; but Linda was wholly struck down.</p>

<p>The saying in his letter to his youngest son that he
was to do to others what he would that they should do
to him, without being discouraged if they did not do
it; and his saying to the Birmingham people that they
were to attend to self-improvement not because it led
to fortune, but because it was right; express a principle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_519" id="Page_3_519">[519]</a></span>
that at all times guided himself. Capable of strong
attachments, he was not what is called an effusive man;
but he had no half-heartedness in any of his likings.
The one thing entirely hateful to him, was indifference.
"I give my heart to very few people; but I would
sooner love the most implacable man in the world than
a careless one, who, if my place were empty to-morrow,
would rub on and never miss me." There was nothing
he more repeatedly told his children than that they
were not to let indifference in others appear to justify
it in themselves. "All kind things," he wrote, "must
be done on their own account, and for their own sake,
and without the least reference to any gratitude."
Again he laid it down, while he was making some exertion
for the sake of a dead friend that did not seem
likely to win proper appreciation from those it was to
serve. "As to gratitude from the family&mdash;as I have
often remarked to you, one does a generous thing because
it is right and pleasant, and not for any response
it is to awaken in others." The rule in another form
frequently appears in his letters; and it was enforced
in many ways upon all who were dear to him. It is
worth while to add his comment on a regret of a member
of his family at an act of self-devotion supposed to
have been thrown away: "Nothing of what is nobly
done can ever be lost." It is also to be noted as in the
same spirit, that it was not the loud but the silent heroisms
he most admired. Of Sir John Richardson, one
of the few who have lived in our days entitled to the
name of a hero, he wrote from Paris in 1856. "Lady
Franklin sent me the whole of that Richardson memoir;
and I think Richardson's manly friendship, and love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_520" id="Page_3_520">[520]</a></span>
of Franklin, one of the noblest things I ever knew in
my life. It makes one's heart beat high, with a sort
of sacred joy." (It is the feeling as strongly awakened
by the earlier exploits of the same gallant man to be
found at the end of Franklin's first voyage, and never
to be read without the most exalted emotion.) It was
for something higher than mere literature he valued the
most original writer and powerful teacher of the age.
"I would go at all times farther to see Carlyle than
any man alive."</p>

<p>Of his attractive points in society and conversation
I have particularized little, because in truth they were
himself. Such as they were, they were never absent
from him. His acute sense of enjoyment gave such
relish to his social qualities that probably no man, not
a great wit or a professed talker, ever left, in leaving
any social gathering, a blank so impossible to fill up.
In quick and varied sympathy, in ready adaptation to
every whim or humour, in help to any mirth or game,
he stood for a dozen men. If one may say such a
thing, he seemed to be always the more himself for
being somebody else, for continually putting off his
personality. His versatility made him unique. What
he said once of his own love of acting, applied to him
equally when at his happiest among friends he loved;
sketching a character, telling a story, acting a charade,
taking part in a game; turning into comedy an incident
of the day, describing the last good or bad thing
he had seen, reproducing in quaint, tragical, or humorous
form and figure, some part of the passionate life
with which all his being overflowed. "Assumption
has charms for me so delightful&mdash;I hardly know for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_521" id="Page_3_521">[521]</a></span>
how many wild reasons&mdash;that I feel a loss of Oh I can't
say what exquisite foolery, when I lose a chance of
being some one not in the remotest degree like myself."
How it was, that, from one of such boundless resource
in contributing to the pleasure of his friends, there was
yet, as I have said, so comparatively little to bring
away, may be thus explained. But it has been also
seen that no one at times said better things, and to
happy examples formerly given I will add one or two
of a kind he more rarely indulged. "He is below par
on the Exchange," a friend remarked of a notorious
puffing actor; "he doesn't stand well at Lloyds."
"Yet no one stands so well with the under-writers,"
said Dickens; a pun that Swift would have envied.
"I call him an Incubus!" said a non-literary friend, at a
loss to express the boredom inflicted on him by a
popular author. "Pen-and-ink-ubus, you mean," interposed
Dickens. So, when Stanfield said of his mid-shipman
son, then absent on his first cruise, "the boy
has got his sea-legs on by this time!" "I don't know,"
remarked Dickens, "about his getting his sea-legs on;
but if I may judge from his writing, he certainly has
not got his A B C legs on."</p>

<p>Other agreeable pleasantries might be largely cited
from his letters. "An old priest" (he wrote from
France in 1862), "the express image of Frederic Lemaitre
got up for the part, and very cross with the
toothache, told me in a railway carriage the other day,
that we had no antiquities in heretical England. 'None
at all?' I said. 'You have some ships however.'
'Yes; a few.' 'Are they strong?' 'Well,' said I,
'your trade is spiritual, my father: ask the ghost of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_522" id="Page_3_522">[522]</a></span>
Nelson.' A French captain who was in the carriage,
was immensely delighted with this small joke. I met
him at Calais yesterday going somewhere with a detachment;
and he said&mdash;Pardon! But he had been so
limited as to suppose an Englishman incapable of that
bonhommie!" In humouring a joke he was excellent,
both in letters and talk; and for this kind of enjoyment
his least important little notes are often worth preserving.
Take one small instance. So freely had
he admired a tale told by his friend and solicitor Mr.
Frederic Ouvry, that he had to reply to a humorous
proposal for publication of it, in his own manner, in
his own periodical. "Your modesty is equal to your
merit.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think your way of describing that rustic
courtship in middle life, quite matchless.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A cheque
for &pound;1000 is lying with the publisher. We would
willingly make it more, but that we find our law
charges so exceedingly heavy." His letters have also
examples now and then of what he called his conversational
triumphs. "I have distinguished myself"
(28th of April 1861) "in two respects lately. I took
a young lady, unknown, down to dinner, and, talking
to her about the Bishop of Durham's nepotism in the
matter of Mr. Cheese, I found she was Mrs. Cheese.
And I expatiated to the member for Marylebone, Lord
Fermoy, generally conceiving him to be an Irish member,
on the contemptible character of the Marylebone
constituency and Marylebone representation."</p>

<p>Among his good things should not be omitted his
telling of a ghost story. He had something of a
hankering after them, as the readers of his briefer
pieces will know; and such was his interest generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_523" id="Page_3_523">[523]</a></span>
in things supernatural that, but for the strong restraining
power of his common sense, he might have fallen
into the follies of spiritualism. As it was, the fanciful
side of his nature stopped short at such pardonable
superstitions as those of dreams, and lucky days, or
other marvels of natural coincidence; and no man
was readier to apply sharp tests to a ghost story or a
haunted house, though there was just so much tendency
to believe in any such, "well-authenticated," as made
perfect his manner of telling one. Such a story is related
in the 125th number of <i>All the Year Round</i>,
which before its publication both Mr. Layard and myself
saw at Gadshill, and identified as one related by
Lord Lytton. It was published in September, and in
a day or two led to what Dickens will relate. "The
artist himself who is the hero of that story" (to Lord
Lytton, 15th of September 1861) "has sent me in
black and white his own account of the whole experience,
so very original, so very extraordinary, so very
far beyond the version I have published, that all other
like stories turn pale before it." The ghost thus reinforced
came out in the number published on the 5th
of October; and the reader who cares to turn to it,
and compare what Dickens in the interval (17th of
September) wrote to myself, will have some measure
of his readiness to believe in such things. "Upon the
publication of the ghost story, up has started the portrait-painter
who saw the phantoms! His own written
story is out of all distance the most extraordinary that
ever was produced; and is as far beyond my version or
Bulwer's, as Scott is beyond James. Everything connected
with it is amazing; but conceive this&mdash;the portrait-painter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_524" id="Page_3_524">[524]</a></span>
had been engaged to write it elsewhere as
a story for next Christmas, and not unnaturally supposed,
when he saw himself anticipated in <i>All the Year
Round</i>, that there had been treachery at his printer's.
'In particular,' says he, 'how else was it possible
that the date, the 13th of September, could have been
got at? For I never told the date, until I wrote it.'
Now, <i>my</i> story had <span class="smcap">no date</span>; but seeing, when I looked
over the proof, the great importance of having <i>a</i> date,
I (C. D.) wrote in, unconsciously, the exact date on
the margin of the proof!" The reader will remember
the Doncaster race story; and to other like illustrations
of the subject already given, may be added this dream.
"Here is a curious case at first-hand" (30th of May
1863). "On Thursday night in last week, being at
the office here, I dreamed that I saw a lady in a red
shawl with her back towards me (whom I supposed to
be E.). On her turning round I found that I didn't
know her, and she said 'I am Miss Napier.' All the
time I was dressing next morning, I thought&mdash;What a
preposterous thing to have so very distinct a dream
about nothing! and why Miss Napier? for I never
heard of any Miss Napier. That same Friday night, I
read. After the reading, came into my retiring-room,
Mary Boyle and her brother, and <i>the</i> Lady in the red
shawl whom they present as 'Miss Napier!' These
are all the circumstances, exactly told."</p>

<p>Another kind of dream has had previous record, with
no superstition to build itself upon but the loving devotion
to one tender memory. With longer or shorter
intervals this was with him all his days. Never from
his waking thoughts was the recollection altogether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_525" id="Page_3_525">[525]</a></span>
absent; and though the dream would leave him for a
time, it unfailingly came back. It was the feeling of
his life that always had a mastery over him. What he
said on the sixth anniversary of the death of his sister-in-law,
that friend of his youth whom he had made his
ideal of all moral excellence, he might have said as truly
after twenty-six years more. In the very year before
he died, the influence was potently upon him. "She
is so much in my thoughts at all times, especially when
I am successful, and have greatly prospered in anything,
that the recollection of her is an essential part of my
being, and is as inseparable from my existence as the
beating of my heart is." Through later troubled years,
whatever was worthiest in him found in this an ark
of safety; and it was the nobler part of his being which
had thus become also the essential. It gave to success
what success by itself had no power to give; and
nothing could consist with it, for any length of time,
that was not of good report and pure. What more
could I say that was not better said from the pulpit of
the Abbey where he rests?</p>

<p>"He whom we mourn was the friend of mankind, a
philanthropist in the true sense; the friend of youth,
the friend of the poor, the enemy of every form of
meanness and oppression. I am not going to attempt
to draw a portrait of him. Men of genius are different
from what we suppose them to be. They have greater
pleasures and greater pains, greater affections and
greater temptations, than the generality of mankind,
and they can never be altogether understood by their
fellow men.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But we feel that a light has gone out,
that the world is darker to us, when they depart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_526" id="Page_3_526">[526]</a></span>
There are so very few of them that we cannot afford to
lose them one by one, and we look vainly round for
others who may supply their places. He whose loss
we now mourn occupied a greater space than any other
writer in the minds of Englishmen during the last thirty-three
years. We read him, talked about him, acted
him; we laughed with him; we were roused by him
to a consciousness of the misery of others, and to a
pathetic interest in human life. Works of fiction, indirectly,
are great instructors of this world; and we can
hardly exaggerate the debt of gratitude which is due to
a writer who has led us to sympathize with these good,
true, sincere, honest English characters of ordinary life,
and to laugh at the egotism, the hypocrisy, the false
respectability of religious professors and others. To
another great humourist who lies in this Church the
words have been applied that his death eclipsed the
gaiety of nations. But of him who has been recently
taken I would rather say, in humbler language, that no
one was ever so much beloved or so much mourned."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> summer and autumn of 1869 were passed quietly
at Gadshill. He received there, in June, the American
friends to whom he had been most indebted for unwearying
domestic kindness at his most trying time in
the States. In August, he was at the dinner of the
International boat-race; and, in a speech that might
have gone far to reconcile the victors to changing places
with the vanquished, gave the healths of the Harvard
and the Oxford crews. He went to Birmingham, in
September, to fulfil a promise that he would open the
session of the Institute; and there, after telling his
audience that his invention, such as it was, never would
have served him as it had done, but for the habit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_528" id="Page_3_528">[528]</a></span>
commonplace, patient, drudging attention, he declared
his political creed to be infinitesimal faith in the people
governing and illimitable faith in the People governed.
In such engagements as these, with nothing of the kind
of strain he had most to dread, there was hardly more
movement or change than was necessary to his enjoyment
of rest.</p>

<p>He had been able to show Mr. Fields something of
the interest of London as well as of his Kentish home.
He went over its "general post-office" with him, took
him among its cheap theatres and poor lodging-houses,
and piloted him by night through its most notorious
thieves' quarter. Its localities that are pleasantest to a
lover of books, such as Johnson's Bolt-court and Goldsmith's
Temple-chambers, he explored with him; and,
at his visitor's special request, mounted a staircase he
had not ascended for more than thirty years, to show
the chambers in Furnival's Inn where the first page of
<i>Pickwick</i> was written. One more book, unfinished,
was to close what that famous book began; and the
original of the scene of its opening chapter, the opium-eater's
den, was the last place visited. "In a miserable
court at night," says Mr. Fields, "we found a
haggard old woman blowing at a kind of pipe made of
an old ink-bottle; and the words which Dickens puts
into the mouth of this wretched creature in <i>Edwin
Drood</i>, we heard her croon as we leaned over the tattered
bed in which she was lying."</p>

<p>Before beginning his novel he had written his last
paper for his weekly publication. It was a notice of
my <i>Life of Landor</i>, and contained some interesting
recollections of that remarkable man. His memory at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_529" id="Page_3_529">[529]</a></span>
this time dwelt much, as was only natural, with past
pleasant time, as he saw familiar faces leaving us or
likely to leave; and, on the death of one of the comedians
associated with the old bright days of Covent
Garden, I had intimation of a fancy that had never
quitted him since the Cheltenham reading. "I see in
the paper to-day that Meadows is dead. I had a talk
with him at Coutts's a week or two ago, when he said
he was seventy-five, and very weak. Except for having
a tearful eye, he looked just the same as ever. My mind
still constantly misgives me concerning Macready.
Curiously, I don't think he has been ever, for ten minutes
together, out of my thoughts since I talked with
Meadows last. Well, the year that brings trouble
brings comfort too: I have a great success in the boy-line
to announce to you. Harry has won the second
scholarship at Trinity Hall, which gives him &pound;50 a
year as long as he stays there; and I begin to hope that
he will get a fellowship." I doubt if anything ever
more truly pleased him than this little success of his
son Henry at Cambridge. Henry missed the fellowship,
but was twenty-ninth wrangler in a fair year, when
the wranglers were over forty.</p>

<p>He finished his first number of <i>Edwin Drood</i> in the
third week of October, and on the 26th read it at my
house with great spirit. A few nights before we had
seen together at the Olympic a little drama taken from
his <i>Copperfield</i>, which he sat out with more than patience,
even with something of enjoyment; and another pleasure
was given him that night by its author, Mr. Halliday,
who brought into the box another dramatist, Mr.
Robertson, to whom Dickens, who then first saw him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_530" id="Page_3_530">[530]</a></span>
said that to himself the charm of his little comedies
was "their unassuming form," which had so happily
shown that "real wit could afford to put off any airs of
pretension to it." He was at Gadshill till the close of
the year; coming up for a few special occasions, such
as Procter's eighty-second birthday; and at my house
on new-year's eve he read to us, again aloud, a fresh
number of his book. Yet these very last days of December
had not been without a reminder of the grave
warnings of April. The pains in somewhat modified
form had returned in both his left hand and his left
foot a few days before we met; and they were troubling
him still on that day. But he made so light of them
himself; so little thought of connecting them with the
uncertainties of touch and tread of which they were
really part; and read with such an overflow of humour
Mr. Honeythunder's boisterous philanthropy; that there
was no room, then, for anything but enjoyment. His
only allusion to an effect from his illness was his mention
of a now invincible dislike which he had to railway
travel. This had decided him to take a London
house for the twelve last readings in the early months
of 1870, and he had become Mr. Milner-Gibson's
tenant at 5, Hyde Park Place.</p>

<p>St. James's Hall was to be the scene of these Readings,
and they were to occupy the interval from the
11th of January to the 15th of March; two being given
in each week to the close of January, and the remaining
eight on each of the eight Tuesdays following. Nothing
was said of any kind of apprehension as the time approached;
but, with a curious absence of the sense of
danger, there was certainly both distrust and fear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_531" id="Page_3_531">[531]</a></span>
Sufficient precaution was supposed to have been taken<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
by arrangement for the presence, at each reading, of
his friend and medical attendant, Mr. Carr Beard; but
this resolved itself, not into any measure of safety, the
case admitting of none short of stopping the reading
altogether, but simply into ascertainment of the exact
amount of strain and pressure, which, with every fresh
exertion, he was placing on those vessels of the brain
where the Preston trouble too surely had revealed that
danger lay. No supposed force in reserve, no dominant
strength of will, can turn aside the penalties sternly
exacted for disregard of such laws of life as were here
plainly overlooked; and though no one may say that it
was not already too late for any but the fatal issue,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_532" id="Page_3_532">[532]</a></span>
there will be no presumption in believing that life
might yet have been for some time prolonged if these
readings could have been stopped.</p>

<p>"I am a little shaken," he wrote on the 9th of January,
"by my journey to Birmingham to give away the
Institution's prizes on Twelfth Night, but I am in good
heart; and, notwithstanding Lowe's worrying scheme
for collecting a year's taxes in a lump, which they tell
me is damaging books, pictures, music, and theatres
beyond precedent, our 'let' at St. James's Hall is
enormous." He opened with <i>Copperfield</i> and the
<i>Pickwick Trial;</i> and I may briefly mention, from the
notes taken by Mr. Beard and placed at my disposal,
at what cost of exertion to himself he gratified the
crowded audiences that then and to the close made
these evenings memorable. His ordinary pulse on the
first night was at 72; but never on any subsequent
night was lower than 82, and had risen on the later
nights to more than 100. After <i>Copperfield</i> on the
first night it went up to 96, and after <i>Marigold</i> on the
second to 99; but on the first night of the <i>Sikes and
Nancy</i> scenes (Friday the 21st of January) it went
from 80 to 112, and on the second night (the 1st of
February) to 118. From this, through the six remaining
nights, it never was lower than 110 after the first
piece read; and after the third and fourth readings of
the <i>Oliver Twist</i> scenes it rose, from 90 to 124 on the
15th of February, and from 94 to 120 on the 8th of
March; on the former occasion, after twenty minutes'
rest, falling to 98, and on the latter, after fifteen minutes'
rest, falling to 82. His ordinary pulse on entering
the room, during these last six nights, was more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_533" id="Page_3_533">[533]</a></span>
than once over 100, and never lower than 84; from
which it rose, after <i>Nickleby</i> on the 22nd of February,
to 112. On the 8th of February, when he read <i>Dombey</i>,
it had risen from 91 to 114; on the 1st of March,
after <i>Copperfield</i>, it rose from 100 to 124; and when he
entered the room on the last night it was at 108, having
risen only two beats more when the reading was done.
The pieces on this occasion were the <i>Christmas Carol</i>,
followed by the <i>Pickwick Trial;</i> and probably in all
his life he never read so well. On his return from the
States, where he had to address his effects to audiences
composed of immense numbers of people, a certain loss
of refinement had been observable; but the old delicacy
was now again delightfully manifest, and a subdued
tone, as well in the humorous as the serious portions,
gave something to all the reading as of a quiet sadness
of farewell. The charm of this was at its height when
he shut the volume of <i>Pickwick</i> and spoke in his own
person. He said that for fifteen years he had been
reading his own books to audiences whose sensitive
and kindly recognition of them had given him instruction
and enjoyment in his art such as few men could
have had; but that he nevertheless thought it well
now to retire upon older associations, and in future to
devote himself exclusively to the calling which had
first made him known. "In but two short weeks from
this time I hope that you may enter, in your own
homes, on a new series of readings at which my assistance
will be indispensable; but from these garish
lights I vanish now for evermore, with a heartfelt,
grateful, respectful, affectionate farewell." The brief
hush of silence as he moved from the platform; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_534" id="Page_3_534">[534]</a></span>
the prolonged tumult of sound that followed suddenly,
stayed him, and again for another moment brought him
back; will not be forgotten by any present.</p>

<p>Little remains to be told that has not in it almost
unmixed pain and sorrow. Hardly a day passed, while
the readings went on or after they closed, unvisited by
some effect or other of the disastrous excitement shown
by the notes of Mr. Beard. On the 23rd of January,
when for the last time he met Carlyle, he came to us
with his left hand in a sling; on the 7th of February,
when he passed with us his last birthday, and on the
25th, when he read the third number of his novel, the
hand was still swollen and painful; and on the 21st of
March, when he read admirably his fourth number, he
told us that as he came along, walking up the length
of Oxford-street, the same incident had recurred as on
the day of a former dinner with us, and he had not
been able to read, all the way, more than the right-hand
half of the names over the shops. Yet he had
the old fixed persuasion that this was rather the effect
of a medicine he had been taking than of any grave
cause, and he still strongly believed his other troubles
to be exclusively local. Eight days later he wrote:
"My uneasiness and hemorrhage, after having quite
left me, as I supposed, has come back with an aggravated
irritability that it has not yet displayed. You
have no idea what a state I am in to-day from a sudden
violent rush of it; and yet it has not the slightest effect
on my general health that I know of." This was a disorder
which troubled him in his earlier life; and during
the last five years, in his intervals of suffering from other
causes, it had from time to time taken aggravated form.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_535" id="Page_3_535">[535]</a></span></p>

<p>His last public appearances were in April. On the
5th he took the chair for the Newsvendors, whom he
helped with a genial address in which even his apology
for little speaking overflowed with irrepressible humour.
He would try, he said, like Falstaff, "but with a modification
almost as large as himself," less to speak himself
than to be the cause of speaking in others. "Much
in this manner they exhibit at the door of a snuff-shop
the effigy of a Highlander with an empty mull in his
hand, who, apparently having taken all the snuff he
can carry, and discharged all the sneezes of which he
is capable, politely invites his friends and patrons to
step in and try what they can do in the same line."
On the 30th of the same month he returned thanks for
"Literature" at the Royal Academy dinner, and I may
preface my allusion to what he then said with what he
had written to me the day before. Three days earlier
Daniel Maclise had passed away. "Like you at Ely,
so I at Higham, had the shock of first reading at a
railway station of the death of our old dear friend and
companion. What the shock would be, you know too
well. It has been only after great difficulty, and after
hardening and steeling myself to the subject by at once
thinking of it and avoiding it in a strange way, that I
have been able to get any command over it or over
myself. If I feel at the time that I can be sure of the
necessary composure, I shall make a little reference to
it at the Academy to-morrow. I suppose you won't be
there."<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> The reference made was most touching and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_536" id="Page_3_536">[536]</a></span>
manly. He told those who listened that since he first
entered the public lists, a very young man indeed, it
had been his constant fortune to number among his
nearest and dearest friends members of that Academy
who had been its pride; and who had now, one by
one, so dropped from his side that he was grown to
believe, with the Spanish monk of whom Wilkie spoke,
that the only realities around him were the pictures
which he loved, and all the moving life but a shadow
and a dream. "For many years I was one of the two
most intimate friends and most constant companions
of Mr. Maclise, to whose death the Prince of Wales
has made allusion, and the President has referred with
the eloquence of genuine feeling. Of his genius in his
chosen art, I will venture to say nothing here; but of
his fertility of mind and wealth of intellect I may confidently
assert that they would have made him, if he
had been so minded, at least as great a writer as he was
a painter. The gentlest and most modest of men, the
freshest as to his generous appreciation of young aspirants
and the frankest and largest hearted as to his peers,
incapable of a sordid or ignoble thought, gallantly sustaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_537" id="Page_3_537">[537]</a></span>
the true dignity of his vocation, without one
grain of self-ambition, wholesomely natural at the last
as at the first, 'in wit a man, simplicity a child,'&mdash;no
artist of whatsoever denomination, I make bold to say,
ever went to his rest leaving a golden memory more
pure from dross, or having devoted himself with a truer
chivalry to the art-goddess whom he worshipped."
These were the last public words of Dickens, and he
could not have spoken any worthier.</p>

<p>Upon his appearance at the dinner of the Academy
had followed some invitations he was led to accept;
greatly to his own regret, he told me on the night (7th
of May) when he read to us the fifth number of <i>Edwin
Drood;</i> for he was now very eager to get back to the
quiet of Gadshill. He dined with Mr. Motley, then
American minister; had met Mr. Disraeli at a dinner
at Lord Stanhope's; had breakfasted with Mr. Gladstone;
and on the 17th was to attend the Queen's ball
with his daughter. But she had to go there without
him; for on the 16th I had intimation of a sudden
disablement. "I am sorry to report, that, in the old
preposterous endeavour to dine at preposterous hours
and preposterous places, I have been pulled up by a
sharp attack in my foot. And serve me right. I hope
to get the better of it soon, but I fear I must not think
of dining with you on Friday. I have cancelled everything
in the dining way for this week, and that is a
very small precaution after the horrible pain I have had
and the remedies I have taken." He had to excuse
himself also from the General Theatrical Fund dinner,
where the Prince of Wales was to preside; but at another
dinner a week later, where the King of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_538" id="Page_3_538">[538]</a></span>
Belgians and the Prince were to be present, so much
pressure was put upon him that he went, still suffering
as he was, to dine with Lord Houghton.</p>

<p>We met for the last time on Sunday the 22nd of May,
when I dined with him in Hyde Park Place. The
death of Mr. Lemon, of which he heard that day, had
led his thoughts to the crowd of friendly companions
in letters and art who had so fallen from the ranks since
we played Ben Jonson together that we were left almost
alone. "And none beyond his sixtieth year," he said,
"very few even fifty." It is no good to talk of it, I
suggested. "We shall not think of it the less" was
his reply; and an illustration much to the point was
before us, afforded by an incident deserving remembrance
in his story. Not many weeks before, a correspondent
had written to him from Liverpool describing
himself as a self-raised man, attributing his prosperous
career to what Dickens's writings had taught him at its
outset of the wisdom of kindness, and sympathy for
others; and asking pardon for the liberty he took in
hoping that he might be permitted to offer some acknowledgment
of what not only had cheered and
stimulated him through all his life, but had contributed
so much to the success of it. The letter enclosed
&pound;500. Dickens was greatly touched by this; and told
the writer, in sending back his cheque, that he would
certainly have taken it if he had not been, though not
a man of fortune, a prosperous man himself; but that
the letter, and the spirit of its offer, had so gratified
him, that if the writer pleased to send him any small
memorial of it in another form he would gladly receive
it. The memorial soon came. A richly worked basket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_539" id="Page_3_539">[539]</a></span>
of silver, inscribed "from one who has been cheered
and stimulated by Mr. Dickens's writings, and held the
author among his first remembrances when he became
prosperous," was accompanied by an extremely handsome
silver centrepiece for the table, of which the
design was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'for'">four</ins> figures representing the Seasons. But
the kindly donor shrank from sending Winter to one
whom he would fain connect with none but the brighter
and milder days, and he had struck the fourth figure
from the design. "I never look at it," said Dickens,
"that I don't think most of the Winter."</p>

<p>A matter discussed that day with Mr. Ouvry was
briefly resumed in a note of the 29th of May, the last
I ever received from him; which followed me to
Exeter, and closed thus. "You and I can speak of it
at Gads by and by. Foot no worse. But no better."
The old trouble was upon him when we parted, and
this must have been nearly the last note written before
he quitted London. He was at Gadshill on the 30th
of May; and I heard no more until the telegram
reached me at Launceston on the night of the 9th of
June, which told me that the "by and by" was not to
come in this world.</p>

<p>The few days at Gadshill had been given wholly to
work on his novel. He had been easier in his foot and
hand; and, though he was suffering severely from the
local hemorrhage before named, he made no complaint
of illness. But there was observed in him a very unusual
appearance of fatigue. "He seemed very weary."
He was out with his dogs for the last time on Monday
the 6th of June, when he walked with his letters into
Rochester. On Tuesday the 7th, after his daughter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_540" id="Page_3_540">[540]</a></span>
Mary had left on a visit to her sister Kate, not finding
himself equal to much fatigue, he drove to Cobhamwood
with his sister-in-law, there dismissed the carriage,
and walked round the park and back. He returned
in time to put up in his new conservatory some
Chinese lanterns sent from London that afternoon;
and, the whole of the evening, he sat with Miss Hogarth
in the dining-room that he might see their effect
when lighted. More than once he then expressed his
satisfaction at having finally abandoned all intention
of exchanging Gadshill for London; and this he had
done more impressively some days before. While he
lived, he said, he should like his name to be more and
more associated with the place; and he had a notion
that when he died he should like to lie in the little
graveyard belonging to the Cathedral at the foot of the
Castle wall.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June he passed all the day writing in
the Ch&acirc;let. He came over for luncheon; and, much
against his usual custom, returned to his desk. Of the
sentences he was then writing, the last of his long life
of literature, a portion has been given in facsimile on
a previous page; and the reader will observe with a
painful interest, not alone its evidence of minute labour
at this fast-closing hour of time with him, but the
direction his thoughts had taken. He imagines such
a brilliant morning as had risen with that eighth of
June shining on the old city of Rochester. He sees
in surpassing beauty, with the lusty ivy gleaming in the
sun, and the rich trees waving in the balmy air, its
antiquities and its ruins; its Cathedral and Castle.
But his fancy, then, is not with the stern dead forms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_541" id="Page_3_541">[541]</a></span>
of either; but with that which makes warm the cold
stone tombs of centuries, and lights them up with flecks
of brightness, "fluttering there like wings." To him,
on that sunny summer morning, the changes of glorious
light from moving boughs, the songs of birds, the
scents from garden, woods, and fields, have penetrated
into the Cathedral, have subdued its earthy odour,
and are preaching the Resurrection and the Life.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He was late in leaving the Ch&acirc;let; but before dinner,
which was ordered at six o'clock with the intention
of walking afterwards in the lanes, he wrote some letters,
among them one to his friend Mr. Charles Kent
appointing to see him in London next day; and dinner
was begun before Miss Hogarth saw, with alarm, a
singular expression of trouble and pain in his face.
"For an hour," he then told her, "he had been very
ill;" but he wished dinner to go on. These were the
only really coherent words uttered by him. They were
followed by some, that fell from him disconnectedly,
of quite other matters; of an approaching sale at a
neighbour's house, of whether Macready's son was
with his father at Cheltenham, and of his own intention
to go immediately to London; but at these latter
he had risen, and his sister-in-law's help alone prevented
him from falling where he stood. Her effort
then was to get him on the sofa, but after a slight
struggle he sank heavily on his left side. "On the
ground" were the last words he spoke. It was now a
little over ten minutes past six o'clock. His two
daughters came that night with Mr. Beard, who had
also been telegraphed for, and whom they met at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_542" id="Page_3_542">[542]</a></span>
station. His eldest son arrived early next morning, and
was joined in the evening (too late) by his younger
son from Cambridge. All possible medical aid had
been summoned. The surgeon of the neighbourhood
was there from the first, and a physician from London
was in attendance as well as Mr. Beard. But all human
help was unavailing. There was effusion on the brain;
and though stertorous breathing continued all night,
and until ten minutes past six o'clock on the evening
of Thursday the 9th of June, there had never been a
gleam of hope during the twenty-four hours. He had
lived four months beyond his 58th year.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The excitement and sorrow at his death are within
the memory of all. Before the news of it even reached
the remoter parts of England, it had been flashed
across Europe; was known in the distant continents
of India, Australia, and America; and not in English-speaking
communities only, but in every country of
the civilised earth, had awakened grief and sympathy.
In his own land it was as if a personal bereavement
had befallen every one. Her Majesty the Queen telegraphed
from Balmoral "her deepest regret at the sad
news of Charles Dickens's death;" and this was the
sentiment alike of all classes of her people. There was
not an English journal that did not give it touching
and noble utterance; and the <i>Times</i> took the lead in
suggesting<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> that the only fit resting-place for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_543" id="Page_3_543">[543]</a></span>
remains of a man so dear to England was the Abbey
in which the most illustrious Englishmen are laid.</p>

<p>With the expression thus given to a general wish,
the Dean of Westminster lost no time in showing ready
compliance; and on the morning of the day when it
appeared was in communication with the family and
representatives. The public homage of a burial in the
Abbey had to be reconciled with his own instructions
to be privately buried without previous announcement
of time or place, and without monument or memorial.
He would himself have preferred to lie in the small
graveyard under Rochester Castle wall, or in the little
churches of Cobham or Shorne; but all these were
found to be closed; and the desire of the Dean and
Chapter of Rochester to lay him in their Cathedral had
been entertained, when the Dean of Westminster's
request, and the considerate kindness of his generous
assurance that there should be only such ceremonial as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_544" id="Page_3_544">[544]</a></span>
would strictly obey all injunctions of privacy, made it
a grateful duty to accept that offer. The spot already
had been chosen by the Dean; and before mid-day on
the following morning, Tuesday the 14th of June, with
knowledge of those only who took part in the burial,
all was done. The solemnity had not lost by the simplicity.
Nothing so grand or so touching could have
accompanied it, as the stillness and the silence of the
vast Cathedral. Then, later in the day and all the
following day, came unbidden mourners in such crowds,
that the Dean had to request permission to keep open
the grave until Thursday; but after it was closed they
did not cease to come, and "all day long," Doctor
Stanley wrote on the 17th, "there was a constant pressure
to the spot, and many flowers were strewn upon it
by unknown hands, many tears shed from unknown
eyes." He alluded to this in the impressive funeral
discourse delivered by him in the Abbey on the morning
of Sunday the 19th, pointing to the fresh flowers
that then had been newly thrown (as they still are
thrown, in this fourth year after the death), and saying
that "the spot would thenceforward be a sacred one
with both the New World and the Old, as that of the
representative of the literature, not of this island only,
but of all who speak our English tongue." The stone
placed upon it is inscribed</p>

all my real and personal estate (except such as is vested in me as
a trustee or mortgagee) unto the said Georgina Hogarth and the
said John Forster, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns
respectively, upon trust that they the said Georgina Hogarth
and John Forster, or the survivor of them or the executors or administrators
of such survivor, do and shall, at their, his, or her
uncontrolled and irresponsible direction, either proceed to an immediate
sale or conversion into money of the said real and personal
estate (including my copyrights), or defer and postpone any
sale or conversion into money, till such time or times as they, he,
or she shall think fit, and in the meantime may manage and let
the said real and personal estate (including my copyrights), in such
manner in all respects as I myself could do, if I were living and
acting therein; it being my intention that the trustees or trustee
for the time being of this my Will shall have the fullest power
over the said real and personal estate which I can give to them,
him, or her. <span class="smcap">And I declare</span> that, until the said real and personal
estate shall be sold and converted into money, the rents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_563" id="Page_3_563">[563]</a></span>
and annual income thereof respectively shall be paid and applied
to the person or persons in the manner and for the purposes to
whom and for which the annual income of the monies to arise
from the sale or conversion thereof into money would be payable
or applicable under this my Will in case the same were sold or
converted into money. <span class="smcap">And I declare</span> that my real estate shall
for the purposes of this my Will be considered as converted into
personalty upon my decease. <span class="smcap">And I declare</span> that the said
trustees or trustee for the time being, do and shall, with and out
of the monies which shall come to their, his, or her hands, under
or by virtue of this my Will and the trusts thereof, pay my just
debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, and legacies. <span class="smcap">And I
declare</span> that the said trust funds or so much thereof as shall
remain after answering the purposes aforesaid, and the annual
income thereof, shall be in trust for all my children (but subject
as to my daughter Mary to the proviso hereinbefore contained),
who being a son or sons shall have attained or shall attain the age
of twenty-one years, and being a daughter or daughters shall have
attained or shall attain that age or be previously married, in equal
shares if more than one. <span class="smcap">Provided always</span>, that, as regards my
copyrights and the produce and profits thereof, my said daughter
Mary, notwithstanding the proviso hereinbefore contained with
reference to her, shall share with my other children therein
whether she be married or not. <span class="smcap">And I devise</span> the estates vested
in me at my decease as a trustee or mortgagee unto the use of the
said Georgina Hogarth and John Forster, their heirs and assigns,
upon the trusts and subject to the equities affecting the same respectively.
<span class="smcap">And I appoint</span> the said <span class="smcap">Georgina Hogarth</span> and
<span class="smcap">John Forster</span> executrix and executor of this my Will, and
<span class="smcap">Guardians</span> of the persons of my children during their respective
minorities. <span class="smcap">And lastly</span>, as I have now set down the form of
words which my legal advisers assure me are necessary to the
plain objects of this my Will, I solemnly enjoin my dear children
always to remember how much they owe to the said Georgina
Hogarth, and never to be wanting in a grateful and affectionate
attachment to her, for they know well that she has been,
through all the stages of their growth and progress, their ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_564" id="Page_3_564">[564]</a></span>
useful self-denying and devoted friend. <span class="smcap">And I desire</span> here
simply to record the fact that my wife, since our separation by
consent, has been in the receipt from me of an annual income of
&pound;600, while all the great charges of a numerous and expensive
family have devolved wholly upon myself. I emphatically direct
that I be buried in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly
private manner; that no public announcement be made of the
time or place of my burial; that at the utmost not more than three
plain mourning coaches be employed; and that those who attend
my funeral wear no scarf, cloak, black bow, long hat-band, or
other such revolting absurdity. I <span class="smcap">direct</span> that my name be inscribed
in plain English letters on my tomb, without the addition
of 'Mr.' or 'Esquire.' I conjure my friends on no account to
make me the subject of any monument, memorial, or testimonial
whatever. I rest my claims to the remembrance of my country
upon my published works, and to the remembrance of my friends
upon their experience of me in addition thereto. I commit my
soul to the mercy of God through our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ, and I exhort my dear children humbly to try to guide
themselves by the teaching of the New Testament in its broad
spirit, and to put no faith in any man's narrow construction of its
letter here or there. <span class="smcap">In witness</span> whereof I the said Charles
Dickens, the testator, have to this my last Will and Testament set
my hand this 12th day of May in the year of our Lord 1869.</p>

<h3>CORRECTIONS MADE IN THE LATER EDITIONS
OF THE SECOND VOLUME.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">I regret</span> to have had no opportunity until now (May, 1873) of
making the corrections which appear in this impression of my
second volume. All the early reprints having been called for
before the close of 1872, the only change I at that time found
possible was amendment of an error at p. <a href="#Page_2_397">397</a>, as to the date of
the first performance at Devonshire House, and of a few others of
small importance at pp. <a href="#Page_2_262">262</a>, <a href="#Page_2_291">291</a>, <a href="#Page_2_320">320</a>, <a href="#Page_2_360">360</a>, <a href="#Page_2_444">444</a>, and <a href="#Page_2_446">446</a>.</p>

<p>Premising that additional corrections, also unimportant, are now
made at pp. <a href="#Page_2_57">57</a>, <a href="#Page_2_135">135</a>, <a href="#Page_2_136">136</a>, <a href="#Page_2_142">142</a>, <a href="#Page_2_301">301</a>, <a href="#Page_2_329">329</a>, <a href="#Page_2_405">405</a>, and <a href="#Page_2_483">483</a>, I proceed
to indicate what may seem to require more detailed mention.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>P. <a href="#Page_2_50">50</a>. "Covent-garden" is substituted for "Drury-lane." The
<i>Chronicle</i> atoned for its present silence by a severe
notice of the man's subsequent appearance at the Haymarket;
and of this I am glad to be reminded by Mr.
Gruneisen, who wrote the criticism.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2_50">50</a>. The son of the publican referred to (Mr. Whelpdale of
Streatham), pointing out my error in not having made
the Duke of Brunswick the defendant, says he was himself
a witness in the case, and has had pride in repeating
to his own children what the Chief Justice said of
his father.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2_117">117</a>. The "limpet on the rock" and the "green boots" refer
to a wonderful piece by Turner in the previous year's
Academy, exhibiting a rock overhanging a magnificent
sea, a booted figure appearing on the rock, and at its
feet a blotch to represent a limpet: the subject being
Napoleon at St. Helena.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_567" id="Page_3_567">[567]</a></span></p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_2_168">168</a>. "Assumption" is substituted for "Transfiguration."</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2_182">182</a>. Six words are added to the first note.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2_193">193</a>, <a href="#Page_2_194">194</a>. An error in my former statement of the circumstances
of Mr. Fletcher's death, which I much regret to
have made, is now corrected.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2_195">195</a>. The proper names of the ship and her captain are here
given, as the Fant&ocirc;me, commanded by Sir Frederick
(now Vice-Admiral) Nicolson.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2_229">229</a>. A correspondent familiar with Lausanne informs me
that the Castle of Chillon is not visible from Rosemont,
and that Dickens in these first days must have mistaken
some other object for it. "A long mass of mountain
hides Chillon from view, and it only becomes visible
when you get about six miles from Lausanne on the
Vevay road, when a curve in the road or lake shows it
visible behind the bank of mountains." The error at p.
<a href="#Page_2_257">257</a>, now corrected, was mine.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2_247">247</a>. "Clinking," the right word, replaces "drinking."</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2_263">263</a>. A passage which stood in the early editions is removed,
the portrait which it referred to having been not that of the
lady mentioned, but of a relative bearing the same name.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2_267">267</a>, <a href="#Page_2_268">268</a>. I quote a letter to myself from one of the baronet's
family present at the outbreak goodnaturedly exaggerated
in Mr. Cerjat's account to Dickens. "I well remember
the dinner at Mr. Cerjat's alluded to in one of
the letters from Lausanne in your Life of Dickens. It
was not however our first acquaintance with the 'distinguished
writer,' as he came with his family to stay at
a Pension on the border of the Lake of Geneva where
my father and his family were then living, and notwithstanding
the gallant captain's 'habit' the families
subsequently became very intimate."</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2_270">270</a>. Lord Vernon is more correctly described as the fifth
Baron, who succeeded to the title in 1835 and died in
1866 in his 64th year.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2_283">283</a>. The distance of Mont Blanc from the Neuch&acirc;tel road is
now properly given as sixty not six miles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_568" id="Page_3_568">[568]</a></span></p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_2_341">341</a>, second line from bottom. Not "subsequent" but "modified"
is the proper word.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2_398">398</a>. In mentioning the painters who took an interest in the
Guild scheme I omitted the distinguished name of Mr.
E. M. Ward, R.A., by whom an admirable design,
taken from Defoe's life, was drawn for the card of
membership.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2_455">455</a>, <a href="#Page_2_456">456</a>. In supposing that the Child's Dream of a Star was
not among Dickens's Reprinted Pieces, I fell into an
error, which is here corrected.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2_468">468</a>. I did not mean to imply that Lady Graham was herself
a Sheridan. She was only connected with the family
she so well "represented" by being the sister of the
lady whom Tom Sheridan married.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The incident at Mr. Hone's funeral quoted at pp. <a href="#Page_2_31">31</a>-<a href="#Page_2_33">33</a> from a
letter to Mr. Felton written by Dickens shortly after the occurrence
(2nd of March, 1843), and published, a year before my volume, in
Mr. Field's <i>Yesterdays with Authors</i> (pp. <a href="#Page_2_146">146</a>-<a href="#Page_2_148">8</a>), has elicited from
the "Independent clergyman" referred to a counter statement of
the alleged facts, of which I here present an abridgement, omitting
nothing that is in any way material. "Though it is thirty
years since .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. several who were present survive to this day, and
have a distinct recollection of all that occurred. One of these is
the writer of this article&mdash;another, the Rev. Joshua Harrison.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The Independent clergyman never wore bands, and had no Bible
under his arm.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. An account of Mr. Hone had appeared in some
of the newspapers, containing an offensive paragraph to the effect
that one 'speculation' having failed, Mr. Hone was disposed, and
persuaded by the Independent clergyman, to try another, that
other being 'to try his powers in the pulpit.' This was felt by the
family to be an insult alike to the living and the dead.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mr.
Harrison's account is, that the Independent clergyman was observed
speaking to Miss Hone about something apparently annoying
to both, and that, turning to Mr. Cruikshank, he said 'Have
you seen the sketch of Mr. Hone's life in the <i>Herald?</i>' Mr. C.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3_569" id="Page_3_569">[569]</a></span>
replied 'Yes.' 'Don't you think it very discreditable? It is a
gross reflection on our poor friend, as if he would use the most
sacred things merely for a piece of bread; and it is a libel on me
and the denomination I belong to, as if we could be parties to
such a proceeding.' Mr. C. said in reply, 'I know something of
the article, but what you complain of was not in it originally&mdash;it
was an addition by another hand.' Mr. C. afterwards stated that
he wrote the article, 'but <i>not</i> the offensive paragraph.' The vulgar
nonsense put into the mouth of the clergyman by Mr. Dickens was
wound up, it is said, by 'Let us pray' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but this <i>cannot</i> be true;
and for this reason, the conversation with Mr. Cruikshank took
place before the domestic service, and that service, according to
Nonconformist custom, is always begun by reading an appropriate
passage of Scripture.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mr. Dickens says that while they were
kneeling at prayer Mr. Cruikshank whispered to him what he
relates. Mr. C. denies it; and I believe him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In addition to
the improbability, one of the company remembers that Mr. Dickens
and Mr. Cruikshank did not sit together, and could not have knelt
side by side." The reader must be left to judge between what is
said of the incident in the text and these recollections of it after
thirty years.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At the close of the corrections to the first volume, prefixed to
the second, the intention was expressed to advert at the end of the
work to information, not in correction but in illustration of my
text, forwarded by obliging correspondents who had been scholars
at the Wellington House Academy (i. <a href="#Page_74">74</a>). But inexorable limits
of space prevent, for the present, a fulfilment of this intention.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The reader will forgive my quoting from a letter of the date of the
22d April, 1848. "I desire no better for my fame, when my personal
dustiness shall be past the control of my love of order, than such a
biographer and such a critic." "You know me better," he wrote, resuming
the same subject on the 6th of July, 1862, "than any other
man does, or ever will." In an entry of my diary during the interval
between these years, I find a few words that not only mark the time
when I first saw in its connected shape the autobiographical fragment
which will form the substance of the second chapter of this biography,
but also express his own feeling respecting it when written: "20 January,
1849. The description may make none of the impression on
others that the reality made on him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Highly probable that it may
never see the light. No wish. Left to J. F. or others." The first
number of <i>David Copperfield</i> appeared five months after this date; but
though I knew, even before he adapted his fragment of autobiography
to the eleventh number, that he had now abandoned the notion of
completing it under his own name, the "<i>no wish</i>," or the discretion
left me, was never in any way subsequently modified. What follows,
from the same entry, refers to the manuscript of the fragment: "No
blotting, as when writing fiction; but straight on, as when writing ordinary
letter."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The reader will probably think them worth subjoining. Dr. Danson
wrote: "<i>April, 1864.</i> <span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>, On the recent occasion of the
U. C. H. dinner, you would probably have been amused and somewhat
surprised to learn that one of those whom you addressed had
often accompanied you over that 'field of forty footsteps' to which you
so aptly and amusingly alluded. It is now some years since I was
accidentally reading a paper written by yourself in the <i>Household
Words</i>, when I was first impressed with the idea that the writer described
scenes and persons with which I was once familiar, and that
he must necessarily be the veritable Charles Dickens of 'our school,'&mdash;the
school of Jones! I did not then, however, like to intrude myself
upon you, for I could hardly hope that you would retain any recollection
of myself; indeed, it was only barely possible you should do
so, however vividly <i>I</i> might recall you in many scenes of fun and frolic
of my school-days. I happened to be present at the dinner of Tuesday
last (being interested as an old student in the school of the hospital),
and was seated very near you; I was tempted during the evening
to introduce myself to you, but feared lest an explanation such as this
in a public room might attract attention and be disagreeable to yourself.
A man who has attained a position and celebrity such as yours
will probably have many early associates and acquaintances claiming
his notice. I beg of you to believe that such is not my object, but
that having so recently met you I feel myself unable to repress the
desire to assure you that no one in the room could appreciate the
fame and rank you have so fairly won, or could wish you more
sincerely long life and happiness to enjoy them, than, Dear Sir, your
old schoolfellow, <span class="smcap">Henry Danson</span>." To this Dickens replied: "<span class="smcap">Gadshill
Place</span>, <i>Thursday, 5th May, 1864</i>. <span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>, I should have
assured you before now that the receipt of your letter gave me great
pleasure, had I not been too much occupied to have leisure for correspondence.
I perfectly recollect your name as that of an old schoolfellow,
and distinctly remember your appearance and dress as a boy,
and believe you had a brother who was unfortunately drowned in the
Serpentine. If you had made yourself personally known to me at the
dinner, I should have been well pleased; though in that case I should
have lost your modest and manly letter. Faithfully yours, <span class="smcap">Charles
Dickens.</span>"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> I take other fanciful allusions to the lady from two of his occasional
writings. The first from his visit to the city churches (written
during the Dombey time, when he had to select a church for the marriage
of Florence): "Its drowsy cadence soon lulls the three old
women asleep, and the unmarried tradesman sits looking out at
window, and the married tradesman sits looking at his wife's bonnet,
and the lovers sit looking at one another, so superlatively happy, that
I mind when I, turned of eighteen, went with my Angelica to a city
church on account of a shower (by this special coincidence that it was
in Huggin Lane), and when I said to my Angelica, 'Let the blessed
event, Angelica, occur at no altar but this!' and when my Angelica
consented that it should occur at no other&mdash;which it certainly never
did, for it never occurred anywhere. And O, Angelica, what has become
of you, this present Sunday morning when I can't attend to the
sermon? and, more difficult question than that, what has become of
Me as I was when I sat by your side?" The second, from his pleasant
paper on birthdays: "I gave a party on the occasion. She was there.
It is unnecessary to name Her, more particularly; She was older than
I, and had pervaded every chink and crevice of my mind for three or
four years. I had held volumes of Imaginary Conversations with her
mother on the subject of our union, and I had written letters more in
number than Horace Walpole's, to that discreet woman, soliciting her
daughter's hand in marriage. I had never had the remotest intention
of sending any of those letters; but to write them, and after a few
days tear them up, had been a sublime occupation."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> To this date belongs a visit paid him at Furnival's Inn in Mr. Macrone's
company by the notorious Mr. N. P. Willis, who calls him "a
young paragraphist for the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>," and thus sketches his
residence and himself: "In the most crowded part of Holborn, within
a door or two of the Bull-and-Mouth Inn, we pulled up at the entrance
of a large building used for lawyers' chambers. I followed by
a long flight of stairs to an upper story, and was ushered into an uncarpeted
and bleak-looking room, with a deal table, two or three
chairs and a few books, a small boy and Mr. Dickens, for the contents.
I was only struck at first with one thing (and I made a memorandum
of it that evening as the strongest instance I had seen of English
obsequiousness to employers), the degree to which the poor author
was overpowered with the honor of his publisher's visit! I remember
saying to myself, as I sat down on a rickety chair, 'My good fellow,
if you were in America with that fine face and your ready quill, you
would have no need to be condescended to by a publisher.' Dickens
was dressed very much as he has since described Dick Swiveller,
<i>minus</i> the swell look. His hair was cropped close to his head, his
clothes scant, though jauntily cut, and, after changing a ragged office-coat
for a shabby blue, he stood by the door, collarless and buttoned
up, the very personification, I thought, of a close sailer to the wind."
I remember, while my friend lived, our laughing heartily at this description,
hardly a word of which is true; and I give it now as no unfair
specimen of the kind of garbage that since his death also has been
served up only too plentifully by some of his own as well as by others
of Mr. Willis's countrymen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Not quoted in detail, on that or any other occasion; though referred
to. It was, however, placed in my hands, for use if occasion
should arise, when Dickens went to America in 1867. The letter
bears date the 7th July, 1849, and was Mr. Chapman's answer to the
question Dickens had asked him, whether the account of the origin of
<i>Pickwick</i> which he had given in the preface to the cheap edition in
1847 was not strictly correct. "It is so correctly described," was Mr.
Chapman's opening remark, "that I can throw but little additional
light on it." The name of his hero, I may add, Dickens took from
that of a celebrated coach-proprietor of Bath.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The appeal was then made to him because of recent foolish statements
by members of Mr. Seymour's family, which Dickens thus contradicted:
"It is with great unwillingness that I notice some intangible
and incoherent assertions which have been made, professedly on behalf
of Mr. Seymour, to the effect that he had some share in the invention
of this book, or of anything in it, not faithfully described in the foregoing
paragraph. With the moderation that is due equally to my
respect for the memory of a brother-artist, and to my self-respect, I
confine myself to placing on record here the facts&mdash;That Mr. Seymour
never originated or suggested an incident, a phrase, or a word, to be
found in this book. That Mr. Seymour died when only twenty-four
pages of this book were published, and when assuredly not forty-eight
were written. That I believe I never saw Mr. Seymour's handwriting
in my life. That I never saw Mr. Seymour but once in my life,
and that was on the night but one before his death, when he certainly
offered no suggestion whatsoever. That I saw him then in the presence
of two persons, both living, perfectly acquainted with all these
facts, and whose written testimony to them I possess. Lastly, that Mr.
Edward Chapman (the survivor of the original firm of Chapman &amp; Hall)
has set down in writing, for similar preservation, his personal knowledge
of the origin and progress of this book, of the monstrosity of the baseless
assertions in question, and (tested by details) even of the self-evident
impossibility of there being any truth in them." The "written
testimony" alluded to is also in my possession, having been inclosed to
me by Dickens, in 1867, with Mr. Chapman's letter here referred to.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Whether Mr. Chapman spelt the name correctly, or has unconsciously
deprived his fat beau of the letter "r," I cannot say; but experience
tells me that the latter is probable. I have been trying all my
life to get my own name spelt correctly, and have only very imperfectly
succeeded.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Her epitaph, written by him, remains upon a gravestone in the
cemetery at Kensal Green: "Young, beautiful, and good, God numbered
her among his angels at the early age of seventeen."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> I have a memorandum in Dickens's writing that five hundred
pounds was to have been given for it, and an additional two hundred
and fifty pounds on its sale reaching three thousand copies; but I feel
certain it was surrendered on more favorable terms.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The allusion was to the supposed author of a paper in the <i>Quarterly
Review</i> (Oct. 1837), in the course of which there was much high
praise, but where the writer said at the close, "Indications are not
wanting that the particular vein of humor which has hitherto yielded
so much attractive metal is worked out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The fact is, Mr. Dickens
writes too often and too fast.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If he persists much longer in this
course, it requires no gift of prophecy to foretell his fate:&mdash;he has risen
like a rocket, and he will come down like the stick."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> There is an earlier allusion I may quote, from a letter in January,
for its mention of a small piece written by him at this time, but not included
in his acknowledged writings: "I am as badly off as you. I
have not done the <i>Young Gentlemen</i>, nor written the preface to <i>Grimaldi</i>,
nor thought of <i>Oliver Twist</i>, or even supplied a subject for the
plate." The <i>Young Gentlemen</i> was a small book of sketches which he
wrote anonymously as the companion to a similar half-crown volume
of <i>Young Ladies</i> (not written by him), for Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall.
He added subsequently a like volume of <i>Young Couples</i>, also without
his name.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Here is another of the same month: "All day I have been at work
on <i>Oliver</i>, and hope to finish the chapter by bedtime. I wish you'd
let me know what Sir Francis Burdett has been saying about him at
some Birmingham meeting. B. has just sent me the <i>Courier</i> containing
some reference to his speech; but the speech I haven't seen."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Reproduced as below, in large type, and without a word of contradiction
or even doubt, in a biography of Mr. Dickens put forth by
Mr. Hotten: "Dr. Shelton McKenzie, in the American <i>Round Table</i>,
relates this anecdote of <i>Oliver Twist:</i> In London I was intimate with
the brothers Cruikshank, Robert and George, but more particularly
with the latter. Having called upon him one day at his house (it was
then in Myddelton Terrace, Pentonville), I had to wait while he was
finishing an etching, for which a printer's boy was waiting. To while
away the time, I gladly complied with his suggestion that I should look
over a portfolio crowded with etchings, proofs, and drawings, which
lay upon the sofa. Among these, carelessly tied together in a wrap of
brown paper, was a series of some twenty-five or thirty drawings, very
carefully finished, through most of which were carried the well-known
portraits of Fagin, Bill Sikes and his dog, Nancy, the Artful Dodger,
and Master Charles Bates&mdash;all well known to the readers of <i>Oliver
Twist</i>. There was no mistake about it; and when Cruikshank turned
round, his work finished, I said as much. He told me that it had long
been in his mind to show the life of a London thief by a series of
drawings engraved by himself, in which, without a single line of letter-press,
the story would be strikingly and clearly told. 'Dickens,' he
continued, 'dropped in here one day, just as you have done, and,
while waiting until I could speak with him, took up that identical portfolio,
and ferreted out that bundle of drawings. When he came to
that one which represents Fagin in the condemned cell, he studied it
for half an hour, and told me that he was tempted to change the whole
plot of his story; not to carry Oliver Twist through adventures in the
country, but to take him up into the thieves' den in London, show what
their life was, and bring Oliver through it without sin or shame. I
consented to let him write up to as many of the designs as he thought
would suit his purpose; and that was the way in which Fagin, Sikes,
and Nancy were created. My drawings suggested them, rather than
his strong individuality suggested my drawings.'"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> This question has been partly solved, since my last edition, by
Mr. Cruikshank's announcement in the <i>Times</i>, that, though Dr. Mackenzie
had "confused some circumstances with respect to Mr. Dickens
looking over some drawings and sketches," the substance of his information
as to who it was that originated <i>Oliver Twist</i>, and all its
characters, had been derived from Mr. Cruikshank himself. The worst
part of the foregoing fable, therefore, has not Dr. Mackenzie for its
author; and Mr. Cruikshank is to be congratulated on the prudence
of his rigid silence respecting it as long as Mr. Dickens lived.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Upon receiving this letter I gently reminded him that I had made
objection at the time to the arrangement on the failure of which he
empowered me to bring about the settlement it was now proposed to
supersede. I cannot give his reply, as it would be unbecoming to repeat
the warmth of its expression to myself, but I preserve its first few
lines to guard against any possible future misstatement: "If you suppose
that anything in my letter could by the utmost latitude of construction
imply the smallest dissatisfaction on my part, for God's sake
dismiss such a thought from your mind. I have never had a momentary
approach to doubt or discontent where you have been mediating for
me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I could say more, but you would think me foolish and rhapsodical;
and such feeling as I have for you is better kept within one's
own breast than vented in imperfect and inexpressive words."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> "I cannot call to mind now how I came to hear about Yorkshire
schools when I was a not very robust child, sitting in by-places near
Rochester castle, with a head full of Partridge, Strap, Tom Pipes, and

picked up at that time."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> This portrait was given to Dickens by his publishers, for whom it
was painted with a view to an engraving for <i>Nickleby</i>, which, however,
was poorly executed, and of a size too small to do the original any
kind of justice. To the courtesy of its present possessor, the Rev. Sir
Edward Repps Joddrell, and to the careful art of Mr. Robert Graves,
A.R.A., I owe the illustration at the opening of this volume, in which
the head is for the first time worthily expressed. In some sort to help
also the reader's fancy to a complete impression, Maclise having caught
as happily the figure as the face, a skillful outline of the painting has
been executed for the present page by Mr. Jeens. "As a likeness,"
said Mr. Thackeray of the work, and no higher praise could be given
to it, "it is perfectly amazing. A looking-glass could not render a
better fac-simile. We have here the real identical man Dickens, the
inward as well as the outward of him."</p></div>

on Heaven knows where in my portmanteau. I have only time to say,
go straight to Liverpool by the first Birmingham train on Monday
morning, and at the Adelphi Hotel in that town you will find me. I
trust to you to see my dear Kate and bring the latest intelligence of
her and the darlings. My best love to them."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> One of these disputes is referred to by Charles Knight in his Autobiography;
and I see in Dickens's letters the mention of another in
which I seem to have been turned by his kindly counsel from some
folly I was going to commit: "I need not, I am sure, impress upon
you the sincerity with which I make this representation. Our close and
hearty friendship happily spares me the necessity. But I will add this&mdash;that
feeling for you an attachment which no ties of blood or other
relationship could ever awaken, and hoping to be to the end of my life
your affectionate and chosen friend, I am convinced that I counsel you
now as you would counsel me if I were in the like case; and I hope
and trust that you will be led by an opinion which I am sure cannot
be wrong when it is influenced by such feelings as I bear towards you,
and so many warm and grateful considerations."</p></div>

friends whose hospitality we had enjoyed with Mr. Ainsworth,
and whose shrewd, quaint, old-world ways come delightfully
back to me as I write his once well-known and widely-honored name.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> I have mentioned the fact in my <i>Life of Landor;</i> and to the passage
I here add the comment made by Dickens when he read it: "It
was at a celebration of his birthday in the first of his Bath lodgings, 35,
St. James's Square, that the fancy which took the form of Little Nell
in the <i>Curiosity Shop</i> first dawned on the genius of its creator. No
character in prose fiction was a greater favorite with Landor. He
thought that, upon her, Juliet might for a moment have turned her
eyes from Romeo, and that Desdemona might have taken her hair-breadth
escapes to heart, so interesting and pathetic did she seem to
him; and when, some years later, the circumstance I have named was
recalled to him, he broke into one of those whimsical bursts of comical
extravagance out of which arose the fancy of Boythorn. With tremendous
emphasis he confirmed the fact, and added that he had never
in his life regretted anything so much as his having failed to carry out
an intention he had formed respecting it; for he meant to have purchased
that house, 35, St. James's Square, and then and there to have
burnt it to the ground, to the end that no meaner association should
ever desecrate the birthplace of Nell. Then he would pause a little,
become conscious of our sense of his absurdity, and break into a
thundering peal of laughter." Dickens had himself proposed to tell
this story as a contribution to my biography of our common friend,
but his departure for America prevented him. "I see," he wrote to
me, as soon as the published book reached him, "you have told, with
what our friend would have called <i>won</i>-derful accuracy, the little St.
James's Square story, which a certain faithless wretch was to have
related."</p></div>

address in resuming his work (30th June, 1837), he said, "By one set
of intimate acquaintances, especially well informed, he has been killed
outright; by another, driven mad; by a third, imprisoned for debt;
by a fourth, sent per steamer to the United States; by a fifth, rendered

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> The speeches generally were good, but the descriptions in the text
by himself will here be thought sufficient. One or two sentences
ought, however, to be given to show the tone of Wilson's praise, and
I will only preface them by the remark that Dickens's acknowledgments,
as well as his tribute to Wilkie, were expressed with great
felicity, and that Peter Robertson seems to have thrown the company
into convulsions of laughter by his imitation of Dominie Sampson's
<span class="smcap">Pro-di-gi-ous</span>, in a supposed interview between that worthy schoolmaster
and Mr. Squeers of Dotheboys. I now quote from Professor
Wilson's speech:</p>
<p>
"Our friend has mingled in the common walks of life; he has made
himself familiar with the lower orders of society. He has not been
deterred by the aspect of vice and wickedness, and misery and guilt,
from seeking a spirit of good in things evil, but has endeavored by the
might of genius to transmute what was base into what is precious as
the beaten gold.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I shall be betrayed, if I go on much longer,&mdash;which
it would be improper for me to do,&mdash;into something like a
critical delineation of the genius of our illustrious guest. I shall not
attempt that; but I cannot but express, in a few ineffectual words, the
delight which every human bosom feels in the benign spirit which
pervades all his creations. How kind and good a man he is, I need
not say; nor what strength of genius he has acquired by that profound
sympathy with his fellow-creatures, whether in prosperity and happiness,
or overwhelmed with unfortunate circumstances, but who yet do
not sink under their miseries, but trust to their own strength of endurance,
to that principle of truth and honor and integrity which is no
stranger to the uncultivated bosom, and which is found in the lowest
abodes in as great strength as in the halls of nobles and the palaces of
kings. Mr. Dickens is also a satirist. He satirizes human life, but he
does not satirize it to degrade it. He does not wish to pull down what
is high into the neighborhood of what is low. He does not seek to
represent all virtue as a hollow thing, in which no confidence can be
placed. He satirizes only the selfish, and the hard-hearted, and the
cruel. Our distinguished guest may not have given us, as yet, a full
and complete delineation of the female character. But this he has
done: he has not endeavored to represent women as charming merely
by the aid of accomplishments, however elegant and graceful. He has
not depicted those accomplishments as their essentials, but has spoken
of them rather as always inspired by a love of domesticity, by fidelity,
by purity, by innocence, by charity, and by hope, which makes them
discharge, under the most difficult circumstances, their duties, and
which brings over their path in this world some glimpses of the light
of heaven. Mr. Dickens may be assured that there is felt for him all
over Scotland a sentiment of kindness, affection, admiration, and love;
and I know for certain that the knowledge of these sentiments must
make him happy."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> On this occasion, as he told me afterwards, the orchestra did a
double stroke of business, much to the amazement of himself and his
friends, by improvising at his entrance <i>Charley is my Darling</i>, amid
tumultuous shouts of delight.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> Poor good Mr. Fletcher had, among his other peculiarities, a habit
of venting any particular emotion in a wildness of cry that went beyond
even the descriptive power of his friend, who referred to it frequently
in his Broadstairs letters. Here is an instance (20th Sept, 1840):
"Mrs. M. being in the next machine the other day heard him howl
like a wolf (as he does) when he first touched the cold water. I am
glad to have my former story in that respect confirmed. There is no
sound on earth like it. In the infernal regions there may be, but
elsewhere there is no compound addition of wild beasts that could
produce its like for their total. The description of the wolves in <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i> is the nearest thing; but it's feeble&mdash;very feeble&mdash;in comparison."
Of the generally amiable side to all his eccentricities I am
tempted to give an illustration from the same letter: "An alarming
report being brought to me the other day that he was preaching, I
betook myself to the spot, and found he was reading Wordsworth to a
family on the terrace, outside the house, in the open air and public
way. The whole town were out. When he had given them a taste
of Wordsworth, he sent home for Mrs. Norton's book, and entertained
them with selections from that. He concluded with an imitation of
Mrs. Hemans reading her own poetry, which he performed with a
pocket-handkerchief over his head to imitate her veil&mdash;all this in
public, before everybody."</p></div>

1868, Dickens, replying to a letter in which Irving was named, thus
describes the last meeting and leave-taking to which he alludes above:
"Your reference to my dear friend Washington Irving renews the vivid
impressions reawakened in my mind at Baltimore but the other day.
I saw his fine face for the last time in that city. He came there from
New York to pass a day or two with me before I went westward; and
they were made among the most memorable of my life by his delightful
fancy and genial humor. Some unknown admirer of his books and
mine sent to the hotel a most enormous mint-julep, wreathed with
flowers. We sat, one on either side of it, with great solemnity (it
filled a respectably-sized round table), but the solemnity was of very
short duration. It was quite an enchanted julep, and carried us
among innumerable people and places that we both knew. The julep
held out far into the night, and my memory never saw him afterwards
otherwise than as bending over it, with his straw, with an attempted
air of gravity (after some anecdote involving some wonderfully droll
and delicate observation of character), and then, as his eye caught
mine, melting into that captivating laugh of his, which was the brightest
and best I have ever heard."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59_59" id="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> A young lady's account of this party, written next morning, and
quoted in one of the American memoirs of Dickens, enables us to
contemplate his suffering from the point of view of those who inflicted
it: "I went last evening to a party at Judge Walker's, given to the
hero of the day.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When we reached the house, Mr. Dickens had
left the crowded rooms, and was in the hall with his wife, about taking
his departure when we entered the door. We were introduced to him
in our wrapping; and in the flurry and embarrassment of the meeting,
one of the party dropped a parcel, containing shoes, gloves, etc. Mr.
Dickens, stooping, gathered them up and restored them with a laughing
remark, and we bounded up-stairs to get our things off. Hastening
down again, we found him with Mrs. Dickens seated upon a sofa, surrounded
by a group of ladies; Judge Walker having requested him
to delay his departure for a few moments, for the gratification of some
tardy friends who had just arrived, ourselves among the number.
Declining to re-enter the rooms where he had already taken leave of
the guests, he had seated himself in the hall. He is young and handsome,
has a mellow, beautiful eye, fine brow, and abundant hair. His
mouth is large, and his smile so bright it seemed to shed light and
happiness all about him. His manner is easy, negligent, but not elegant.
His dress was foppish; in fact, he was overdressed, yet his
garments were worn so easily they appeared to be a necessary part of
him. (!) He had a dark coat, with lighter pantaloons; a black waistcoat,
embroidered with colored flowers; and about his neck, covering
his white shirt-front, was a black neckcloth, also embroidered in colors,
in which were placed two large diamond pins connected by a chain.
A gold watch-chain, and a large red rose in his button-hole, completed
his toilet. He appeared a little weary, but answered the remarks
made to him&mdash;for he originated none&mdash;in an agreeable manner. Mr.
Beard's portrait of Fagin was so placed in the room that we could see
it from where we stood surrounding him. One of the ladies asked
him if it was his idea of the Jew. He replied, 'Very nearly.' Another,
laughingly, requested that he would give her the rose he wore, as a
memento. He shook his head and said, 'That will not do; he could
not give it to one; the others would be jealous.' A half-dozen then
insisted on having it, whereupon he proposed to divide the leaves
among them. In taking the rose from his coat, either by design or
accident, the leaves loosened and fell upon the floor, and amid considerable
laughter the ladies stooped and gathered them. He remained
some twenty minutes, perhaps, in the hall, and then took his leave. I
must confess to considerable disappointment in the personal of my
idol. I felt that his throne was shaken, although it never could be
destroyed." This appalling picture supplements and very sufficiently
explains the mournful passage in the text.</p></div>

much harder for the poor to be virtuous than it is for the rich; and the
good that is in them, shines the brighter for it. In many a noble
mansion lives a man, the best of husbands and of fathers, whose private
worth in both capacities is justly lauded to the skies. But bring him
here, upon this crowded deck. Strip from his fair young wife her
silken dress and jewels, unbind her braided hair, stamp early wrinkles
on her brow, pinch her pale cheek with care and much privation, array
her faded form in coarsely patched attire, let there be nothing but his
love to set her forth or deck her out, and you shall put it to the proof
indeed. So change his station in the world that he shall see, in those
young things who climb about his knee, not records of his wealth and
name, but little wrestlers with him for his daily bread; so many
poachers on his scanty meal; so many units to divide his every sum
of comfort, and farther to reduce its small amount. In lieu of the
endearments of childhood in its sweetest aspect, heap upon him all its
pains and wants, its sicknesses and ills, its fretfulness, caprice, and
querulous endurance: let its prattle be, not of engaging infant fancies,
but of cold, and thirst, and hunger: and if his fatherly affection outlive
all this, and he be patient, watchful, tender; careful of his children's
lives, and mindful always of their joys and sorrows; then send him
back to parliament, and pulpit, and to quarter sessions, and when he
hears fine talk of the depravity of those who live from hand to mouth,
and labour hard to do it, let him speak up, as one who knows, and tell
those holders-forth that they, by parallel with such a class, should be
high angels in their daily lives, and lay but humble siege to heaven at
last.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Which of us shall say what he would be, if such realities,
with small relief or change all through his days, were his! Looking
round upon these people: far from home, houseless, indigent, wandering,
weary with travel and hard living: and seeing how patiently they
nursed and tended their young children: how they consulted ever their
wants first, then half supplied their own; what gentle ministers of hope
and faith the women were; how the men profited by their example;
and how very, very seldom even a moment's petulance or harsh complaint
broke out among them: I felt a stronger love and honour of my
kind come glowing on my heart, and wished to God there had been
many atheists in the better part of human nature there, to read this
simple lesson in the book of life."</p></div>

They have a superstition in the East,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Allah, written on a piece of paper,</span><br />
Is better unction than can come of priest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of rolling incense, and of lighted taper:</span><br />
Holding, that any scrap which bears that name<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In any characters its front impress'd on,</span><br />
Shall help the finder thro' the purging flame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And give his toasted feet a place to rest on.</span><br />
<br />
Accordingly, they make a mighty fuss<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With every wretched tract and fierce oration,</span><br />
And hoard the leaves&mdash;for they are not, like us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A highly civilized and thinking nation:</span><br />
And, always stooping in the miry ways<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To look for matter of this earthly leaven,</span><br />
They seldom, in their dust-exploring days,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have any leisure to look up to Heaven.</span><br />
<br />
So have I known a country on the earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where darkness sat upon the living waters,</span><br />
And brutal ignorance, and toil, and dearth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were the hard portion of its sons and daughters:</span><br />
And yet, where they who should have oped the door<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of charity and light, for all men's finding</span><br />
Squabbled for words upon the altar-floor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rent The Book, in struggles for the binding.</span><br />
<br />
The gentlest man among those pious Turks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God's living image ruthlessly defaces;</span><br />
Their best High-Churchman, with no faith in works,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bowstrings the Virtues in the market-places.</span><br />
The Christian Pariah, whom both sects curse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(They curse all other men, and curse each other),</span><br />

infants, the work has grown into a cluster of some 300 schools, an
aggregate of nearly 30,000 children, and a body of 3000 voluntary
teachers, most of them the sons and daughters of toil.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of more
than 300,000 children which, on the most moderate calculation, we
have a right to conclude have passed through these schools since their
commencement, I venture to affirm that more than 100,000 of both
sexes have been placed out in various ways, in emigration, in the
marine, in trades, and in domestic service. For many consecutive
years I have contributed prizes to thousands of the scholars; and let
no one omit to call to mind what these children were, whence they
came, and whither they were going without this merciful intervention.
They would have been added to the perilous swarm of the wild, the
lawless, the wretched, and the ignorant, instead of being, as by God's
blessing they are, decent and comfortable, earning an honest livelihood,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_72_72" id="Footnote_72_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> In November 1865 he wrote to me that the sale of his Christmas
fancy for that year (<i>Dr. Marigold's Prescriptions</i>) had gone up, in the
first week, to 250,000.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_73_73" id="Footnote_73_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> A characteristic letter of this date, which will explain itself, has
been kindly sent to me by the gentleman it was written to, Mr. James
Verry Staples, of Bristol:&mdash;"Third of April, 1844. I have been very
much gratified by the receipt of your interesting letter, and I assure
you that it would have given me heartfelt satisfaction to have been in
your place when you read my little <i>Carol</i> to the Poor in your neighbourhood.
I have great faith in the poor; to the best of my ability I
always endeavour to present them in a favourable light to the rich;
and I shall never cease, I hope, until I die, to advocate their being
made as happy and as wise as the circumstances of their condition, in
its utmost improvement, will admit of their becoming. I mention this
to assure you of two things. Firstly, that I try to deserve their attention;
and secondly, that any such marks of their approval and confidence
as you relate to me are most acceptable to my feelings, and go
at once to my heart."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_74_74" id="Footnote_74_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> In a letter on the subject of copyright published by Thomas Hood
after Dickens's return from America, he described what had passed
between himself and one of these pirates who had issued a Master
Humphrey's Clock edited by Bos. "Sir," said the man to Hood, "if
you had observed the name, it was <i>Bos</i>, not <i>Boz;</i> s, sir, not z; and,
besides, it would have been no piracy, sir, even with the z, because
<i>Master Humphrey's Clock</i>, you see, sir, was not published as by Boz,
but by Charles Dickens!"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> The reader may be amused if I add in a note what he said of the
pirates in those earlier days when grave matters touched him less
gravely. On the eve of the first number of <i>Nickleby</i> he had issued a
proclamation. "Whereas we are the only true and lawful Boz. And
whereas it hath been reported to us, who are commencing a new work,
that some dishonest dullards resident in the by-streets and cellars of
this town impose upon the unwary and credulous, by producing cheap
and wretched imitations of our delectable works. And whereas we
derive but small comfort under this injury from the knowledge that
the dishonest dullards aforesaid cannot, by reason of their mental
smallness, follow near our heels, but are constrained to creep along by
dirty and little-frequented ways, at a most respectful and humble distance
behind. And whereas, in like manner, as some other vermin
are not worth the killing for the sake of their carcases, so these kennel
pirates are not worth the powder and shot of the law, inasmuch as
whatever damages they may commit they are in no condition to pay
any. This is to give notice, that we have at length devised a mode of
execution for them, so summary and terrible, that if any gang or gangs
thereof presume to hoist but one shred of the colours of the good ship
<i>Nickleby</i>, we will hang them on gibbets so lofty and enduring that
their remains shall be a monument of our just vengeance to all succeeding
ages; and it shall not lie in the power of any lord high admiral,
on earth, to cause them to be taken down again." The last paragraph
of the proclamation informed the potentates of Paternoster-row, that
from the then ensuing day of the thirtieth of March, until farther
notice, "we shall hold our Levees, as heretofore, on the last evening
but one of every month, between the hours of seven and nine, at our
Board of Trade, number one hundred and eighty-six in the Strand,
London; where we again request the attendance (in vast crowds) of
their accredited agents and ambassadors. Gentlemen to wear knots
upon their shoulders; and patent cabs to draw up with their doors
towards the grand entrance, for the convenience of loading."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_76_76" id="Footnote_76_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76_76"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> This might seem not very credible if I did not give the passage
literally, and I therefore quote it from the careful translation of <i>Taine's
History of English Literature</i> by Mr. Van Laun, one of the masters
of the Edinburgh Academy, where I will venture to hope that other
authorities on English Literature are at the same time admitted.
"Jonas" (also in <i>Chuzzlewit</i>) "is on the verge of madness. There
are other characters quite mad. Dickens has drawn three or four
portraits of madmen, very agreeable at first sight, but so true that they
are in reality horrible. It needed an imagination like his, irregular,
excessive, capable of fixed ideas, to exhibit the derangements of
reason. Two especially there are, which make us laugh, and which
make us shudder. Augustus, the gloomy maniac, who is on the point
of marrying Miss Pecksniff; and poor Mr. Dick, half an idiot, half a
monomaniac, who lives with Miss Trotwood.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The play of these
shattered reasons is like the creaking of a dislocated door; it makes
one sick to hear it." (Vol. ii. p. <a href="#Page_2_346">346</a>.) The original was published
before Dickens's death, but he certainly never saw it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_77_77" id="Footnote_77_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> He wrote from Marseilles (17th Dec. 1844). "When poor Overs
was dying he suddenly asked for a pen and ink and some paper, and
made up a little parcel for me which it was his last conscious act to
direct. She (his wife) told me this and gave it me. I opened it last
night. It was a copy of his little book in which he had written my
name, 'With his devotion.' I thought it simple and affecting of the
poor fellow." From a later letter a few lines may be added. "Mrs.
Overs tells me" (Monte Vacchi, 30th March, 1845) "that Miss Coutts
has sent her, at different times, sixteen pounds, has sent a doctor to
her children, and has got one of the girls into the Orphan School.
When I wrote her a word in the poor woman's behalf, she wrote me
back to the effect that it was a kindness to herself to have done so, 'for
what is the use of my means but to try and do some good with them?'"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_78_78" id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> He regretted one chance missed by his eccentric friend, which he
described to me just before he left Italy. "I saw last night an old
palazzo of the Doria, six miles from here, upon the sea, which De la
Rue urged Fletcher to take for us, when he was bent on that detestable
villa Bagnerello; which villa the Genoese have hired, time out of
mind, for one-fourth of what I paid, as they told him again and again
before he made the agreement. This is one of the strangest old palaces
in Italy, surrounded by beautiful <i>woods</i> of great trees (an immense
rarity here) some miles in extent: and has upon the terrace a high
tower, formerly a prison for offenders against the family, and a defence
against the pirates. The present Doria lets it as it stands for &pound;40
English&mdash;for the year.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the grounds are no expense; being
proudly maintained by the Doria, who spends this rent, when he gets
it, in repairing the roof and windows. It is a wonderful house; full
of the most unaccountable pictures and most incredible furniture:
every room in it like the most quaint and fanciful of Cattermole's pictures;
and how many rooms I am afraid to say." 2nd of June, 1845.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_79_79" id="Footnote_79_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> "We have had a London sky until to-day," he wrote on the 20th
of July, "gray and cloudy as you please: but I am most disappointed,
I think, in the evenings, which are as commonplace as need be; for
there is no twilight, and as to the stars giving more light here than
elsewhere, that is humbug." The summer of 1844 seems to have been,
however, an unusually stormy and wet season. He wrote to me on
the 21st of October that they had had, so far, only four really clear
days since they came to Italy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_80_80" id="Footnote_80_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80_80"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> "My faith on that-point is decidedly shaken, which reminds me to
ask you whether you ever read Simond's Tour in Italy. It is a most
charming book, and eminently remarkable for its excellent sense, and
determination not to give in to conventional lies." In a later letter he
says: "None of the books are unaffected and true but Simond's, which
charms me more and more by its boldness, and its frank exhibition of
that rare and admirable quality which enables a man to form opinions
for himself without a miserable and slavish reference to the pretended
opinions of other people. His notices of the leading pictures enchant
me. They are so perfectly just and faithful, and so whimsically
shrewd." Rome, 9th of March, 1845.</p></div>

but the place is so oddly contrived that one has to go a full mile round

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_83_83" id="Footnote_83_83"></a><a href="#FNanchor_83_83"><span class="label">[83]</span></a> Not however, happily for them, in another important particular,
for on the eve of their return to England she declared her intention of
staying behind and marrying an Italian. "She will have to go to
Florence, I find" (12th of May 1845), "to be married in Lord Holland's
house: and even then is only married according to the English
law: having no legal rights from such a marriage, either in France or
Italy. The man hasn't a penny. If there were an opening for a nice
clean restaurant in Genoa&mdash;which I don't believe there is, for the
Genoese have a natural enjoyment of dirt, garlic, and oil&mdash;it would
still be a very hazardous venture; as the priests will certainly damage
the man, if they can, for marrying a Protestant woman. However,
the utmost I can do is to take care, if such a crisis should arrive, that
she shall not want the means of getting home to England. As my
father would observe, she has sown and must reap."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_84_84" id="Footnote_84_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> He had carried with him, I may here mention, letters of introduction
to residents in all parts of Italy, of which I believe he delivered
hardly one. Writing to me a couple of months before he left the
country he congratulated himself on this fact. "We are living very
quietly; and I am now more than ever glad that I have kept myself
aloof from the 'receiving' natives always, and delivered scarcely any
of my letters of introduction. If I had, I should have seen nothing
and known less. I have observed that the English women who have
married foreigners are invariably the most audacious in the license
they assume. Think of one lady married to a royal chamberlain (not
here) who said at dinner to the master of the house at a place where I
was dining&mdash;that she had brought back his <i>Satirist</i>, but didn't think
there was quite so much 'fun' in it as there used to be. I looked at
the paper afterwards, and found it crammed with such vile obscenity
as positively made one's hair stand on end."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_85_85" id="Footnote_85_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> What his poor little dog suffered should not be omitted from the
troubles of the master who was so fond of him. "Timber has had
every hair upon his body cut off because of the fleas, and he looks like
the ghost of a drowned dog come out of a pond after a week or so. It
is very awful to see him slide into a room. He knows the change upon
him, and is always turning round and round to look for himself. I think
he'll die of grief." Three weeks later: "Timber's hair is growing
again, so that you can dimly perceive him to be a dog. The fleas
only keep three of his legs off the ground now, and he sometimes
moves of his own accord towards some place where they don't want to
go." His improvement was slow, but after this continuous.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_86_86" id="Footnote_86_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> A characteristic message for Jerrold came in a later letter (12th
of May, 1845): "I wish you would suggest to Jerrold for me as a
Caudle subject (if he pursue that idea). 'Mr. Caudle has incidentally
remarked that the house-maid is good-looking.'"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_87_87" id="Footnote_87_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87_87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> Of the dangers of the bay he had before written to me (10th of
August). "A monk was drowned here on Saturday evening. He
was bathing with two other monks, who bolted when he cried out that

Tuesday night the 12th of November), "with the intention of describing
my travels as I went on. But I have seen so much, and travelled
so hard (seldom dining, and being almost always up by candle light),
that I must reserve my crayons for the greater leisure of the Peschiere
after we have met, and I have again returned to it. As soon as I have
fixed a place in my mind, I bolt&mdash;at such strange seasons and at such
unexpected angles, that the brave C stares again. But in this way,
and by insisting on having everything shewn to me whether or no, and
against all precedents and orders of proceeding, I get on wonderfully."
Two days before he had written to me from Ferrara, after the very
pretty description of the vineyards between Piacenza and Parma which
will be found in the <i>Pictures from Italy</i> (pp. 203-4): "If you want an
antidote to this, I may observe that I got up, this moment, to fasten
the window; and the street looked as like some byeway in Whitechapel&mdash;or&mdash;I
look again&mdash;like Wych Street, down by the little barber's
shop on the same side of the way as Holywell Street&mdash;or&mdash;I look again&mdash;as
like Holywell Street itself&mdash;as ever street was like to street, or
ever will be, in this world."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_91_91" id="Footnote_91_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_91"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> Four months later, after he had seen the galleries at Rome and the
other great cities, he sent me a remark which has since had eloquent
reinforcement from critics of undeniable authority. "The most
famous of the oil paintings in the Vatican you know through the
medium of the finest line-engravings in the world; and as to some of
them I much doubt, if you had seen them with me, whether you
might not think you had lost little in having only known them hitherto
in that translation. Where the drawing is poor and meagre, or alloyed
by time,&mdash;it is so, and it must be, often; though no doubt it is a heresy
to hint at such a thing&mdash;the engraving presents the forms and the idea
to you, in a simple majesty which such defects impair. Where this is
not the case, and all is stately and harmonious, still it is somehow in
the very grain and nature of a delicate engraving to suggest to you
(I think) the utmost delicacy, finish, and refinement, as belonging to
the original. Therefore, though the Picture in this latter case will
greatly charm and interest you, it does not take you by surprise. You
are quite prepared beforehand for the fullest excellence of which it is
capable." In the same letter he wrote of what remained always a
delight in his memory, the charm of the more private collections. He
found magnificent portraits and paintings in the private palaces, where
he thought them seen to greater advantage than in galleries; because
in numbers not so large as to distract attention or confuse the eye.
"There are portraits innumerable by Titian, Rubens, Rembrandt and
Vandyke; heads by Guido, and Domenichino, and Carlo Dolci;
subjects by Raphael, and Correggio, and Murillo, and Paul Veronese,
and Salvator; which it would be difficult indeed to praise too highly,
or to praise enough. It is a happiness to me to think that they cannot
be felt, as they should be felt, by the profound connoisseurs who fall
into fits upon the longest notice and the most unreasonable terms.
Such tenderness and grace, such noble elevation, purity, and beauty,
so shine upon me from some well-remembered spots in the walls of
these galleries, as to relieve my tortured memory from legions of
whining friars and waxy holy families. I forgive, from the bottom
of my soul, whole orchestras of earthy angels, and whole groves of St.
Sebastians stuck as full of arrows according to pattern as a lying-in
pincushion is stuck with pins. And I am in no humour to quarrel
even with that priestly infatuation, or priestly doggedness of purpose,
which persists in reducing every mystery of our religion to some literal
development in paint and canvas, equally repugnant to the reason and
the sentiment of any thinking man."</p></div>

servants, I must tell you of a child-bearing handmaiden of some friends
of ours, a thorough out and outer, who, by way of expiating her
sins, caused herself, the other day, to be received into the bosom of
the infallible church. She had two marchionesses for her sponsors;

forged. By ties never to be broken, weakened, changed in any way&mdash;but
to be knotted tighter up, if that be possible, until the same end
comes to them as has come to these. That end but the bright beginning
of a happier union, I believe; and have never more strongly and
religiously believed (and oh! Forster, with what a sore heart I have
thanked God for it) than when that shadow has fallen on my own
hearth, and made it cold and dark as suddenly as in the home of that
poor girl you tell me of.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When you write to me again, the pain
of this will have passed. No consolation can be so certain and so
lasting to you as that softened and manly sorrow which springs up
from the memory of the Dead. I read your heart as easily as if I held
it in my hand, this moment. And I know&mdash;I <i>know</i>, my dear friend&mdash;that
before the ground is green above him, you will be content that
what was capable of death in him, should lie there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am glad to

Naples, to which the reference made in his letters is striking enough
for preservation. "In Naples, the burying place of the poor people is
a great paved yard with three hundred and sixty-five pits in it: every
one covered by a square stone which is fastened down. One of these
pits is opened every night in the year; the bodies of the pauper dead
are collected in the city; brought out in a cart (like that I told you
of at Rome); and flung in, uncoffined. Some lime is then cast down
into the pit; and it is sealed up until a year is past, and its turn again
comes round. Every night there is a pit opened; and every night that
same pit is sealed up again, for a twelvemonth. The cart has a red
lamp attached, and at about ten o'clock at night you see it glaring
through the streets of Naples: stopping at the doors of hospitals and
prisons, and such places, to increase its freight: and then rattling off
again. Attached to the new cemetery (a very pretty one, and well kept:
immeasurably better in all respects than P&egrave;re-la-Chaise) there is
another similar yard, but not so large."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In connection with the
same subject he adds: "About Naples, the dead are borne along the
street, uncovered, on an open bier; which is sometimes hoisted on a
sort of palanquin, covered with a cloth of scarlet and gold. This exposure
of the deceased is not peculiar to that part of Italy; for about
midway between Rome and Genoa we encountered a funeral procession
attendant on the body of a woman, which was presented in its
usual dress, to my eyes (looking from my elevated seat on the box of
a travelling carriage) as if she were alive, and resting on her bed. An
attendant priest was chanting lustily&mdash;and as badly as the priests invariably
do. Their noise is horrible.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p></div>

There is probably no country in the world where they are treated with

Naples correspondent of the <i>Times</i>, writing under date of February 1872.</p></div>

roads in Tuscany more than in any others, of wayside crosses and religious
memorials, may be worth preserving.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "You know that in
the streets and corners of roads, there are all sorts of crosses and similar
memorials to be seen in Italy. The most curious are, I think, in
Tuscany. There is very seldom a figure on the cross, though there is
sometimes a face; but they are remarkable for being garnished with
little models in wood of every possible object that can be connected
with the Saviour's death. The cock that crowed when Peter had
denied his master thrice, is generally perched on the tip-top; and an
ornithological phenomenon he always is. Under him is the inscription.
Then, hung on to the cross-beam, are the spear, the reed with the
sponge of vinegar and water at the end, the coat without seam for
which the soldiers cast lots, the dice-box with which they threw for it,
the hammer that drove in the nails, the pincers that pulled them out,
the ladder which was set against the cross, the crown of thorns, the
instrument of flagellation, the lantern with which Mary went to the
tomb&mdash;I suppose; I can think of no other&mdash;and the sword with which
Peter smote the high priest's servant. A perfect toyshop of little objects;
repeated at every four or five miles all along the highway."</p></div>

"Ten years after Landor had lost this home, an Englishman travelling
in Italy, his friend and mine, visited the neighbourhood for his sake,
drove out from Florence to Fiesole, and asked his coachman which was
the villa in which the Landor family lived. 'He was a dull dog, and
pointed to Boccaccio's. I didn't believe him. He was so deuced
ready that I knew he lied. I went up to the convent, which is on a
height, and was leaning over a dwarf wall basking in the noble view
over a vast range of hill and valley, when a little peasant girl came up
and began to point out the localities. <i>Ecco la villa Landora!</i> was
one of the first half-dozen sentences she spoke. My heart swelled as
Landor's would have done when I looked down upon it, nestling
among its olive-trees and vines, and with its upper windows (there are
five above the door) open to the setting sun. Over the centre of these
there is another story, set upon the housetop like a tower; and all Italy,
except its sea, is melted down into the glowing landscape it commands.
I plucked a leaf of ivy from the convent-garden as I looked; and here
it is. 'For Landor. With my love.' So wrote Mr. Dickens to me
from Florence on the and of April 1845; and when I turned over
Landor's papers in the same month after an interval of exactly twenty
years, the ivy-leaf was found carefully enclosed, with the letter in which
I had sent it." Dickens had asked him before leaving what he would
most wish to have in remembrance of Italy. "An ivy-leaf from Fiesole,"
said Landor.</p></div>

in one of his minor writings, "for coaches of all colours are alike to
poor Kindheart, and he rests far north of the little cemetery with the
cypress trees, by the city walls where the Mediterranean is so beautiful."
What was said on a former page (<i>ante</i>, 182) may here be completed
by a couple of stories told to Dickens by Mr. Walton, suggestive
strongly of the comment that it required indeed a kind heart and
many attractive qualities (which undoubtedly Fletcher possessed) to
render tolerable such eccentricities. Dickens made one of these stories
wonderfully amusing. It related the introduction by Fletcher of an
unknown Englishman to the marble-merchant's house; the stay there
of the Englishman, unasked, for ten days; and finally the walking
off of the Englishman in a shirt, pair of stockings, neckcloth, pocket-handkerchief,
and other etceteras belonging to Mr. Walton, which
never reappeared after that hour. On another occasion, Fletcher confessed
to Mr. Walton his having given a bill to a man in Carrara for
&pound;30; and the marble-merchant having asked, "And pray, Fletcher,
have you arranged to meet it when it falls due?" Fletcher at once replied,
"Yes," and to the marble-merchant's farther enquiry "how?"
added, in his politest manner, "I have arranged to blow my brains out
the day before!" The poor fellow did afterwards almost as much self-violence
without intending it, dying of fever caught in night-wanderings
through Liverpool half-clothed amid storms of rain.</p></div>

I believe in such enormous numbers as on the Mediterranean coast-road,
between Genoa and Spezzia. I will ascertain for curiosity's sake,
whether there are any at this time in Rome, or between it and the
country-house of M&aelig;cenas&mdash;on the ground of Horace's journey. I

letter of the 19th of August 1845. "Perhaps it is a fair specimen of
the odd adventures which befall the inimitable, that the cab in which
the children and the luggage were (I and my womankind being in the
other) got its shafts broken in the city, last Friday morning, through
the horse stumbling on the greasy pavement; <i>and was drawn to the
wharf (about a mile) by a stout man</i>, amid such frightful howlings and
derisive yellings on the part of an infuriated populace, as I never heard
before. Conceive the man in the broken shafts with his back towards
the cab; all the children looking out of the windows; and the muddy
portmanteaus and so forth (which were all tumbled down when the
horse fell) tottering and nodding on the box! The best of it was, that
<i>our</i> cabman, being an intimate friend of the damaged cabman, insisted
on keeping him company; and proceeded at a solemn walk, in front
of the procession; thereby securing to me a liberal share of the popular
curiosity and congratulation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Everything here at Broadstairs is
the same as of old. I have walked 20 miles a day since I came down,
and I went to a circus at Ramsgate on Saturday night, where <i>Mazeppa</i>
was played in three long acts without an H in it: as if for a wager.
Evven, and edds, and errors, and ands, were as plentiful as blackberries;
but the letter H was neither whispered in Evven, nor muttered
in Ell, nor permitted to dwell in any form on the confines of the sawdust."
With this I will couple another theatrical experience of this
holiday, when he saw a Giant played by a village comedian with a
quite Gargantuesque felicity, and singled out for my admiration his
fine manner of sitting down to a hot supper (of children), with the self-lauding
exalting remark, by way of grace, "How pleasant is a quiet
conscience and an approving mind!"</p></div>

of the narrative in the Four Gospels. Allusion was made, shortly after
his death, to the existence of such a manuscript, with expression of a

himself so much as any suggestion of that kind. The little piece was
of a peculiarly private character, written for his children, and exclusively

fallen on better society. It is a small circle certainly, but quite large
enough. The Watsons improve very much on acquaintance. Everybody
is very well informed; and we are all as social and friendly as
people can be, and very merry. We play whist with great dignity and

roofs of the houses, and the quantity of wood employed in their construction
(where they use tile and brick in Italy), render them perfect
forcing-houses. The walls and floors, hot to the hand all the night
through, interfere with sleep; and thunder is almost always booming
and rumbling among the mountains." Besides this, though there were
no mosquitoes as in Genoa, there was at first a plague of flies, more
distressing even than at Albaro. "They cover everything eatable, fall
into everything drinkable, stagger into the wet ink of newly-written
words and make tracks on the writing paper, clog their legs in the

among them, presided over by my landlord, who was 18 years in the
English navy, and is the Sous Prefet of the town&mdash;a very good fellow
indeed; quite an Englishman. Our landlady, nearly twice his age,

by the liners the Wholesale Matrimonial Speculator. My opinion is,
that in any well-ordered state of society, and advanced spirit of social
jurisprudence, he would have been flogged more than once (privately),
and certainly sentenced to transportation for no less a term than the

The same letter told me: "We had a regatta at Ouchy the other day,

concluded with a rowing-match by women, which was very funny. I

but the weather had become unsettled, and he thus referred
to the rainfall which made that summer so disastrous in England.
"What a storm that must have been in London! I wish we could get
something like it, here.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is thundering while I write, but I fear
it don't look black enough for a clearance. The echoes in the mountains
are of such a stupendous sort, that a peal of thunder five or ten
minutes long, is here the commonest of circumstances.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." That
was early in August, and at the close of the month he wrote: "I
forgot to tell you that yesterday week, at half-past 7 in the morning,
we had a smart shock of an earthquake, lasting, perhaps, a quarter of
a minute. It awoke me in bed. The sensation was so curious and
unlike any other, that I called out at the top of my voice I was sure it

sunk so, I felt myself in serious danger. Yet I had little pain in my
side; excepting that time at Genoa I have hardly had any since poor
Mary died, when it came on so badly; and I walked my fifteen miles

periodical which was still and always present to his mind, and which
settled down at last, as the reader knows, into <i>Household Words</i>.
"As to the Review, I strongly incline to the notion of a kind of <i>Spectator</i>
(Addison's)&mdash;very cheap, and pretty frequent. We must have
it thoroughly discussed. It would be a great thing to found something.
If the mark between a sort of <i>Spectator</i>, and a different sort
of <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, could be well hit, my belief is that a deal might be
done. But it should be something with a marked and distinctive and
obvious difference, in its design, from any other existing periodical."</p></div>

"Mamey and Katey have come out in Parisian dresses, and look very
fine. They are not proud, and send their loves. Skittles is cutting
teeth, and gets cross towards evening. Frankey is smaller than ever,
and Walter very large. Charley in statu quo. Everything is enormously
dear. Fuel, stupendously so. In airing the house, we burnt
five pounds' worth of firewood in one week!! We mix it with coal
now, as we used to do in Italy, and find the fires much warmer. To
warm the house thoroughly, this singular habitation requires fires on
the ground floor. We burn three.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p></div>

remember my writing a letter to the prefet of police about that coachman?
I heard no more about it until this very day" (12th of February),
"when, at the moment of your letter arriving, Roche put his
head in at the door (I was busy writing in the Baronial drawing-room)
and said, 'Here is datter cocher!'&mdash;Sir, he had been in prison ever
since! and being released this morning, was sent by the police to pay
back the franc and a half, and to beg pardon, and to get a certificate
that he had done so, or he could not go on the stand again! Isn't this
admirable? But the culminating point of the story (it could happen
with nobody but me) is that he <span class="smcap">was drunk when he came</span>!!
Not very, but his eye was fixed, and he swayed in his sabots, and
smelt of wine, and told Roche incoherently that he wouldn't have done
it (committed the offence, that is) if the people hadn't made him. He
seemed to be troubled with a phantasmagorial belief that all Paris had
gathered round us that night in the Rue St. Honor&eacute;, and urged him
on with frantic shouts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Snow, frost, and cold.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Duke of
Bordeaux is very well, and dines at the Tuileries to-morrow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>When</i>
I have done, I will write you a brilliant letter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Loves from all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Your blue and golden bed looks desolate." The allusion to the Duc
de Bordeaux was to remind me pleasantly of a slip of his own during
our talk with Chateaubriand, when, at a loss to say something interesting
to the old royalist, he bethought him to enquire with sympathy
when he had last seen the representative of the elder branch of
Bourbons, as if he were resident in the city then and there!</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_134_134" id="Footnote_134_134"></a><a href="#FNanchor_134_134"><span class="label">[134]</span></a> This was on Sunday, the 21st of February, when a party were
assembled of whom I think the French Emperor, his cousin the Prince
Napoleon, Doctor Quin, Dickens's eldest son, and myself, are now the
only survivors. Lady Blessington had received the day before from
her brother Major Power, who held a military appointment in Hobart
Town, a small oil-painting of a girl's face by the murderer Wainewright
(mentioned on a former page as having been seen by us
together in Newgate), who was among the convicts there under sentence
of transportation, and who had contrived somehow to put the
expression of his own wickedness into the portrait of a nice kind-hearted
girl. Major Power knew nothing of the man's previous history
at this time, and had employed him on the painting out of a sort of
charity. As soon as the truth went back, Wainewright was excluded
from houses before open to him, and shortly after died very miserably.
What Reynolds said of portrait painting, to explain its frequent want
of refinement, that a man could only put into a face what he had in
himself, was forcibly shown in this incident. The villain's story altogether
moved Dickens to the same interest as it had excited in another
profound student of humanity (Sir Edward Lytton), and, as will be
seen, he also introduced him into one of his later writings.</p></div>

two pages less than I had supposed, and I have a terrible apprehension
that there will not be copy enough for the number! As it could
not possibly come out short, and as there would be no greater possibility
of sending to me, in this short month, to supply what may be
wanted, I decide&mdash;after the first burst of nervousness is gone&mdash;<i>to follow

usual summons to Richards, when his eye fell upon a writing-desk,
belonging to his deceased wife, which had been taken, among other
things, from a cabinet in her chamber. It was not the first time that
his eye had lighted on it. He carried the key in his pocket; and he

of his arrogant demeanour, he sat down, resting his head upon
one hand, and read it through.</p>

<p>"He read it slowly and attentively, and with a nice particularity to
every syllable. Otherwise than as his great deliberation seemed unnatural,
and perhaps the result of an effort equally great, he allowed
no sign of emotion to escape him. When he had read it through, he
folded and refolded it slowly several times, and tore it carefully into
fragments. Checking his hand in the act of throwing these away, he
put them in his pocket, as if unwilling to trust them even to the
chances of being reunited and deciphered; and instead of ringing, as
usual, for little Paul, he sat solitary all the evening in his cheerless

<i>14th December</i>, '46. My dear, dear Dickens!&mdash;and dearer every day,
as you every day give me more pleasure and do me more good! You
do not wonder at this style? for you know that I have been <i>in love
with you</i>, ever since Nelly! and I do not care now who knows it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The Dombeys, my dear D! how can I thank you enough for them!
The truth, and the delicacy, and the softness and depth of the pathos
in that opening death-scene, could only come from one hand; and the
exquisite taste which spares all details, and breaks off just when the
effect is at its height, is wholly yours. But it is Florence on whom my
hopes chiefly repose; and in her I see the promise of another Nelly!
though reserved, I hope, for a happier fate, and destined to let us see
what a <i>grown-up</i> female angel is like. I expect great things, too,
from Walter, who begins charmingly, and will be still better I fancy
than young Nickleby, to whom as yet he bears most resemblance. I
have good hopes too of Susan Nipper, who I think has great capabilities,
and whom I trust you do not mean to drop. Dombey is rather
too hateful, and strikes me as a mitigated Jonas, without his brutal
coarseness and ruffian ferocity. I am quite in the dark as to what you
mean to make of Paul, but shall watch his development with interest.
About Miss Tox, and her Major, and the Chicks, perhaps I do not
care enough. But you know I always grudge the exquisite painting
you waste on such portraits. I love the Captain, tho', and his hook,
as much as you can wish; and look forward to the future appearances
of Carker Junior, with expectations which I know will not be disappointed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p></div>

what a No. 5 you have now given us! I have so cried and sobbed over
it last night, and again this morning; and felt my heart purified by
those tears, and blessed and loved you for making me shed them; and
I never can bless and love you enough. Since the divine Nelly was
found dead on her humble couch, beneath the snow and the ivy, there
has been nothing like the actual dying of that sweet Paul, in the
summer sunshine of that lofty room. And the long vista that leads us
so gently and sadly, and yet so gracefully and winningly, to the plain
consummation! Every trait so true, and so touching&mdash;and yet lightened
by the fearless innocence which goes <i>playfully</i> to the brink of the
grave, and that pure affection which bears the unstained spirit, on its
soft and lambent flash, at once to its source in eternity."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the

from a sharp attack of bronchitis; being then on board the P. and O.
steamer "Malta," invalided from his ship the Topaze, and on his way
home. He was buried at sea on the 2nd of May, 1872. Poor fellow!
He was the smallest in size of all the children, in his manhood reaching
only to a little over five feet; and throughout his childhood was never
called by any other name than the "Ocean Spectre," from a strange
little weird yet most attractive look in his large wondering eyes, very
happily caught in a sketch in oils by the good Frank Stone, done at
Bonchurch in September 1849 and remaining in his aunt's possession.
"Stone has painted," Dickens then wrote to me, "the Ocean Spectre,
and made a very pretty little picture of him." It was a strange chance
that led his father to invent this playful name for one whom the ocean
did indeed take to itself at last.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_143_143" id="Footnote_143_143"></a><a href="#FNanchor_143_143"><span class="label">[143]</span></a> I think it right to place on record here Leigh Hunt's own allusion
to the incident (<i>Autobiography</i>, p. 432), though it will be thought to
have too favourable a tone, and I could have wished that other names
had also found mention in it. But I have already (p. <a href="#Page_2_211">211</a>) stated quite
unaffectedly my own opinion of the very modest pretensions of the
whole affair, and these kind words of Hunt may stand <i>valeant quantum</i>.
"Simultaneous with the latest movement about the pension was one on
the part of my admirable friend Dickens and other distinguished men,
Forsters and Jerrolds, who, combining kindly purpose with an amateur
inclination for the stage, had condescended to show to the public
what excellent actors they could have been, had they so pleased,&mdash;what
excellent actors, indeed, some of them were.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They proposed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a
benefit for myself, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the piece performed on the
occasion was Ben Jonson's <i>Every Man in his Humour</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If anything
had been needed to show how men of letters include actors, on
the common principle of the greater including the less, these gentlemen
would have furnished it. Mr. Dickens's Bobadil had a spirit in
it of intellectual apprehension beyond anything the existing stage has
shown .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and Mr. Forster delivered the verses of Ben Jonson with
a musical flow and a sense of their grace and beauty unknown, I
believe, to the recitation of actors at present. At least I have never
heard anything like it since Edmund Kean's."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To this may be
added some lines from Lord Lytton's prologue spoken at Liverpool,
of which I have not been able to find a copy, if indeed it was printed
at the time; but the verses come so suddenly and completely back to
me, as I am writing after twenty-five years, that in a small way they
recall a more interesting effort of memory told me once by Macready.
On a Christmas night at Drury Lane there came a necessity to put up
the <i>Gamester</i>, which he had not played since he was a youth in his
father's theatre thirty years before. He went to rehearsal shrinking
from the long and heavy study he should have to undergo, when, with
the utterance of the opening sentence, the entire words of the part
came back, including even a letter which Beverly has to read, and
which it is the property-man's business to supply. My lines come
back as unexpectedly; but with pleasanter music than any in Mr.
Moore's dreary tragedy, as a few will show.</p>

my former illustrations of his managerial troubles; but from an elaborate
paper of rules for rehearsals, which I have found in his handwriting,
I quote the opening and the close. "Remembering the very
imperfect condition of all our plays at present, the general expectation
in reference to them, the kind of audience before which they
will be presented, and the near approach of the nights of performance,
I hope everybody concerned will abide by the following regulations,
and will aid in strictly carrying them out." Elaborate are the regulations
set forth, but I take only the three last. "Silence, on the stage and
in the theatre, to be faithfully observed; the lobbies &amp;c. being always
available for conversation. No book to be referred to on the stage;
but those who are imperfect to take their words from the prompter.
Everyone to act, as nearly as possible, as on the night of performance;
everyone to speak out, so as to be audible through the house.
And every mistake of exit, entrance, or situation, to be corrected <i>three
times</i> successively." He closes thus. "All who were concerned in
the first getting up of <i>Every Man in his Humour</i>, and remember how
carefully the stage was always kept then, and who have been engaged
in the late rehearsals of the <i>Merry Wives</i>, and have experienced the
difficulty of getting on, or off: of being heard, or of hearing anybody
else: will, I am sure, acknowledge the indispensable necessity of these
regulations."</p></div>

from an autograph catalogue in which these few lines are given from
an early letter in the Doughty-street days. "I always pay my taxes
when they won't call any longer, in order to get a bad name in the
parish and so escape all honours." It is a touch of character, certainly;
but though his motive in later life was the same, his method
was not. He attended to the tax-collector, but of any other parochial
or political application took no notice whatever.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_154_154" id="Footnote_154_154"></a><a href="#FNanchor_154_154"><span class="label">[154]</span></a> Even in the modest retirement of a note I fear that I shall offend
the dignity of history, and of biography, by printing the lines in which
this intention was announced to me. They were written "in character;"
and the character was that of the "waterman" at the Charing-cross
cabstand, first discovered by George Cattermole, whose imitations
of him were a delight to Dickens at this time, and adapted themselves
in the exuberance of his admiration to every conceivable variety of
subject. The painter of the Derby Day will have a fullness of satisfaction
in remembering this. "Sloppy" the hero in question, had a
friend "Jack" in whom he was supposed to typify his own early and
hard experiences before he became a convert to temperance; and
Dickens used to point to "Jack" as the justification of himself and
Mrs. Gamp for their portentous invention of Mrs. Harris. It is
amazing nonsense to repeat; but to hear Cattermole, in the gruff
hoarse accents of what seemed to be the remains of a deep bass voice
wrapped up in wet straw, repeat the wild proceedings of Jack, was
not to be forgotten. "Yes sir, Jack went mad sir, just afore he
'stablished hisself by Sir Robert Peel's-s-s, sir. He was allis a callin'
for a pint o' beer sir, and they brings him water sir. Yes sir. And so
sir, I sees him dodgin' about one day sir, yes sir, and at last he gits a
hopportunity sir and claps a pitch-plaster on the mouth o' th' pump
sir, and says he's done for his wust henemy sir. Yes sir. And then
they finds him a-sittin' on the top o' the corn-chest sir, yes sir, a
crammin' a old pistol with wisps o' hay and horse-beans sir, and
swearin' he's a goin' to blow hisself to hattoms, yes sir, but he doesn't,
no sir. For I sees him arterwards a lyin' on the straw a manifacktrin'
Bengal cheroots out o' corn-chaff sir and swearin' he'd make 'em
smoke sir, but they hulloxed him off round by the corner of Drummins's-s-s-s-s-s
sir, just afore I come here sir, yes sir. And so you
never see'd us together sir, no sir." This was the remarkable dialect
in which Dickens wrote from Broadstairs on the 13th of July. "About
Saturday sir?&mdash;Why sir, I'm a-going to <i>Folkestone</i> a Saturday sir!&mdash;not
on accounts of the manifacktring of Bengal cheroots as there is
there but for the survayin' o' the coast sir. 'Cos you see sir, bein'
here sir, and not a finishin' my work sir till to-morrow sir, I couldn't
go afore! And if I wos to come home, and not go, and come back
agin sir, wy it would be nat'rally a hulloxing of myself sir. Yes sir.
Wy sir, I b'lieve that the gent as is a goin' to 'stablish hisself sir, in
the autumn, along with me round the corner sir (by Drummins's-s-s-s-s-s
bank) is a comin' down to Folkestone Saturday arternoon&mdash;Leech by
name sir&mdash;yes sir&mdash;another Jack sir&mdash;and if you wos to come down
along with him sir by the train as gits to Folkestone twenty minutes
arter five, you'd find me a smoking a Bengal cheroot (made of clover-chaff
and horse-beans sir) on the platform. You couldn't spend your
arternoon better sir. Dover, Sandgate, Herne Bay&mdash;they're all to be
wisited sir, most probable, till such times as a 'ouse is found sir. Yes
sir. Then decide to come sir, and say you will, and do it. I shall be

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_156_156" id="Footnote_156_156"></a><a href="#FNanchor_156_156"><span class="label">[156]</span></a> The mention of this name may remind me to state that I have
received, in reference to the account in my first volume of Dickens's
repurchase of his <i>Sketches</i> from Mr. Macrone, a letter from the solicitor
and friend of that gentleman so expressed that I could have greatly
wished to revise my narrative into nearer agreement with its writer's
wish. But farther enquiry, and an examination of the books of Messrs.
Chapman and Hall, have confirmed the statement given. Mr. Hansard
is in error in supposing that "unsold impressions" of the books
were included in the transaction (the necessary requirement being
simply that the small remainders on hand should be transferred with
a view to being "wasted"): I know myself that it could not have
included any supposed right of Mr. Macrone to have a novel written
for him, because upon that whole matter, and his continued unauthorised
advertisements of the tale, I decided myself the reference
against him: and Mr. Hansard may be assured that the &pound;2000 was
paid for the copyright alone. For the same copyright, a year before,
Dickens had received &pound;250, both the first and second series being included
in the payment; and he had already had about the same sum
as his half share of the profits of sales. I quote the close of Mr. Hansard's
letter. "Macrone no doubt was an adventurer, but he was
sanguine to the highest degree. He was a dreamer of dreams, putting
no restraint on his exultant hopes by the reflection that he was not
dealing justly towards others. But reproach has fallen upon him
from wrong quarters. He died in poverty, and his creditors received
nothing from his estate. But that was because he had paid away all
he had, and all he had derived from trust and credit, <i>to authors</i>."
This may have been so, but Dickens was not among the authors so
benefited. The <i>Sketches</i> repurchased for the high price I have named
never afterwards really justified such an outlay.</p></div>

Dickens which I shall hope to have Mr. Sala's forgiveness for printing.
"That was very good indeed of Sala's" (some essay he had written).
"He was twenty guineas in advance, by the bye, and I told Wills
delicately to make him a present of it. I find him a very conscientious
fellow. When he gets money ahead, he is not like the imbecile youth
who so often do the like in Wellington-street" (the office of <i>Household

to Paris, with Maclise, at the end of June, of which sufficient farther
note will have been taken if I print the subjoined passages from a letter
to me dated 24th June, 1850, H&ocirc;tel Windsor, Rue de Rivoli. "There
being no room in the H&ocirc;tel Brighton, we are lodged (in a very good
apartment) here. The heat is absolutely frightful. I never felt anything
like it in Italy. Sleep is next to impossible, except in the day,
when the room is dark, and the patient exhausted. We purpose
leaving here on Saturday morning and going to Rouen, whence we
shall proceed either to Havre or Dieppe, and so arrange our proceedings
as to be home, please God, on Tuesday evening. We are going
to some of the little theatres to-night, and on Wednesday to the Fran&ccedil;ais,
for Rachel's last performance before she goes to London. There
does not seem to be anything remarkable in progress, in the theatrical
way. Nor do I observe that out of doors the place is much changed,
except in respect of the carriages which are certainly less numerous.
I also think the Sunday is even much more a day of business than it
used to be. As we are going into the country with Regnier to-morrow,
I write this after letter-time and before going out to dine at the Trois
Fr&egrave;res, that it may come to you by to-morrow's post. The twelve
hours' journey here is astounding&mdash;marvellously done, except in respect
of the means of refreshment, which are absolutely none. Mac
is very well (extremely loose as to his waistcoat, and otherwise careless
in regard of buttons) and sends his love. De Fresne proposes a dinner
with all the notabilities of Paris present, but I <span class="smcap">won't</span> stand it! I really
have undergone so much fatigue from work, that I am resolved not
even to see him, but to please myself. I find, my child (as Horace
Walpole would say), that I have written you nothing here, but you will
take the will for the deed."</p></div>

(a charming little paper which it was one of the first ventures of
the young firm of Chapman and Hall to attempt to establish for
Hunt in 1830), to which accident had unluckily attracted Dickens's
notice:&mdash;"Supposing us to be in want of patronage, and in possession
of talent enough to make it an honour to notice us, we would much
rather have some great and comparatively private friend, rich enough
to assist us, and amiable enough to render obligation delightful, than
become the public property of any man, or of any government.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
If a divinity had given us our choice we should have said&mdash;make us
La Fontaine, who goes and lives twenty years with some rich friend,
as innocent of any harm in it as a child, and who writes what he thinks
charming verses, sitting all day under a tree." Such sayings will not
bear to be deliberately read and thought over, but any kind of extravagance
or oddity came from Hunt's lips with a curious fascination.
There was surely never a man of so sunny a nature, who could draw
so much pleasure from common things, or to whom books were a
world so real, so exhaustless, so delightful. I was only seventeen
when I derived from him the tastes which have been the solace of all
subsequent years, and I well remember the last time I saw him at
Hammersmith, not long before his death in 1859, when, with his delicate,
worn, but keenly intellectual face, his large luminous eyes, his
thick shock of wiry grey hair, and a little cape of faded black silk over
his shoulders, he looked like an old French abb&eacute;. He was buoyant
and pleasant as ever; and was busy upon a vindication of Chaucer
and Spenser from Cardinal Wiseman, who had attacked them for
alleged sensuous and voluptuous qualities.</p></div>

one who took the lead then and since in all good work for Birmingham,
Mr. Arthur Ryland. The reading would, he said in this letter
(7th of Jan. 1853), "take about two hours, with a pause of ten minutes
half way through. There would be some novelty in the thing, as I
have never done it in public, though I have in private, and (if I may

friendly intercourse with Dickens, has this remark: "I give also a
passage from one of his letters written at the time when he sent his son
Charles, through my mediation, to Leipzig. He says in it what he
desires for his son. 'I want him to have all interest in, and to acquire
a knowledge of, the life around him, and to be treated like a gentleman
though pampered in nothing. By punctuality in all things, great
or small, I set great store.'"</p></div>

full of character. "Great excitement here about a wretched woman
who has murdered her child. Apropos of which I observed a curious
thing last night. The newspaper offices (local journals) had placards
like this outside:</p>
<div class='center'>
<small>CHILD MURDER IN BRIGHTON.</small><br />
<small>INQUEST.</small><br />
<small>COMMITTAL OF THE MURDERESS.</small><br />
</div>
I saw so many common people stand profoundly staring at these lines
for half-an-hour together&mdash;and even go back to stare again&mdash;that I
feel quite certain they had not the power of thinking about the thing
at all connectedly or continuously, without having something about it
before their sense of sight. Having got that, they were considering
the case, wondering how the devil they had come into that power. I
saw one man in a smock frock lose the said power the moment he
turned away, and bring his hob-nails back again."</div>

of refusal and evasion on my part, I am now obliged to decide this
question&mdash;whether I shall read two nights at Bradford for a hundred
pounds. If I do, I may take as many hundred pounds as I choose."
27th of Jan. 1854.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_176_176" id="Footnote_176_176"></a><a href="#FNanchor_176_176"><span class="label">[176]</span></a> On the 28th of Dec. 1854 he wrote from Bradford: "The hall is
enormous, and they expect to seat 3700 people to-night! Notwithstanding
which, it seems to me a tolerably easy place&mdash;except that the
width of the platform is so very great to the eye at first." From Folkestone,
on his way to Paris, he wrote in the autumn of 1855: "16th of
Sept. I am going to read for them here, on the 5th of next month,
and have answered in the last fortnight thirty applications to do the
like all over England, Ireland, and Scotland. Fancy my having to
come from Paris in December, to do this, at Peterborough, Birmingham,
and Sheffield&mdash;old promises." Again: 23rd of Sept. "I am
going to read here, next Friday week. There are (as there are everywhere)
a Literary Institution and a Working Men's Institution, which
have not the slightest sympathy or connexion. The stalls are five
shillings, but I have made them fix the working men's admission at
threepence, and I hope it may bring them together. The event
comes off in a carpenter's shop, as the biggest place that can be got."
In 1857, at Paxton's request, he read his <i>Carol</i> at Coventry for the
Institute.</p></div>

Dickens's Amateur Theatricals," which appeared in <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i>
two years ago, by one who had been a member of the Juvenile
Company. I quote a passage, recommending the whole paper as very
agreeably written, with some shrewd criticism. "Mr. Planch&eacute; had in
one portion of the extravaganza put into the mouth of one of the characters
for the moment a few lines of burlesque upon Macbeth, and we
remember Mr. Dickens's unsuccessful attempts to teach the performer
how to imitate Macready, whom he (the performer) had never seen!
And after the performance, when we were restored to our evening-party
costumes, and the school-room was cleared for dancing, still a
stray 'property' or two had escaped the vigilant eye of the property-man,
for Douglas Jerrold had picked up the horse's head (Fortunio's
faithful steed <i>Comrade</i>), and was holding it up before the greatest
living animal painter, who had been one of the audience, with 'Looks
as if it knew <i>you</i>, Edwin!'"</p></div>

transmitted in one of his father's letters will show that he maintained
the reputation as a comedian which his early debut had
awakened. "<span class="smcap">Original Anecdote of the Plornishghenter.</span>
This distinguished wit, being at Boulogne with his family, made a
close acquaintance with his landlord, whose name was M. Beaucourt&mdash;the
only French word with which he was at that time acquainted.
It happened that one day he was left unusually long in a bathing-machine
when the tide was making, accompanied by his two young
brothers and little English nurse, without being drawn to land. The
little nurse, being frightened, cried 'M'soo! M'soo!' The two young
brothers being frightened, cried 'Ici! Ici!'. Our wit, at once perceiving
that his English was of no use to him under the foreign circumstances,
immediately fell to bawling 'Beau-court!' which he
continued to shout at the utmost pitch of his voice and with great
gravity, until rescued.&mdash;<i>New Boulogne Jest Book</i>, page 578."</p></div>

Charles Knight. It had no design, he said, to damage the really
useful truths of Political Economy, but was wholly directed against
"those who see figures and averages, and nothing else; who would
take the average of cold in the Crimea during twelve months as a
reason for clothing a soldier in nankeen on a night when he would be
frozen to death in fur; and who would comfort the labourer in travelling
twelve miles a day to and from his work, by telling him that the
average distance of one inhabited place from another, on the whole
area of England, is not more than four miles."</p></div>

and with an equally mistaken exaltation, above the writer's ordinary
level, of a book which on the whole was undoubtedly below it, Mr.
Taine speaks of <i>Hard Times</i> as that one of Dickens's romances which
is a summary of all the rest: exalting instinct above reason, and the
intuitions of the heart above practical knowledge; attacking all education
based on statistic figures and facts; heaping sorrow and ridicule
on the practical mercantile people; fighting against the pride, hardness,
and selfishness of the merchant and noble; cursing the manufacturing
towns for imprisoning bodies in smoke and mud, and souls
in falsehood and factitiousness;&mdash;while it contrasts, with that satire of
social oppression, lofty eulogy of the oppressed; and searches out poor
workmen, jugglers, foundlings, and circus people, for types of good
sense, sweetness of disposition, generosity, delicacy, and courage, to
perpetual confusion of the pretended knowledge, pretended happiness,
pretended virtue, of the rich and powerful who trample upon them!
This is a fair specimen of the exaggerations with which exaggeration
is rebuked, in Mr. Taine's and much similar criticism.</p></div>

placed in a frame in the hall at Gadshill, a thousand guineas
was given at the Dickens sale. It occupied the great painter only one
or two mornings, and Dickens will tell how it originated. Walking
on Hampstead Heath to think over his Theatrical Fund speech, he
met Mr. Lemon, and they went together to Stanfield. "He has been
very ill, and he told us that large pictures are too much for him, and
he must confine himself to small ones. But I would not have this, I
declared he must paint bigger ones than ever, and what would he
think of beginning upon an act-drop for a proposed vast theatre at
Tavistock House? He laughed and caught at this, we cheered him
up very much, and he said he was quite a man again." April 1855.</p></div>

same eccentric liking for literature, had committed what was called at
the time a breach of judicial decorum. (Such indecorums were less
uncommon in the great days of the Bench.) "The name," he said,
"of the illustrious Charles Dickens has been called on the jury, but he
has not answered. If his great Chancery suit had been still going on,
I certainly would have excused him, but, as that is over, he might
have done us the honour of attending here, that he might have seen
how we went on at common law."</p></div>

they have been since, the touch of disappointment hinted at may raise
a smile. "Provisions are scarcely as cheap as I expected, though
very different from London: besides which, a pound weight here, is a
pound and a quarter English. So that meat at 7<i>d.</i> a pound, is actually
a fourth less. A capital dish of asparagus costs us about fivepence; a
fowl, one and threepence; a duck, a few halfpence more; a dish of fish,
about a shilling. The very best wine at tenpence that I ever drank&mdash;I
used to get it very good for the same money in Genoa, but not so
good. The common people very engaging and obliging."</p></div>

were here in the early weeks, living "in a melancholy but very good
chateau on the Paris road, where their landlord (a Baron) has supplied
them, T. tells me, with one milk-jug as the entire crockery of the
establishment." Our friend soon tired of this, going off to Spa, and
on his return, after ascending the hill to smoke a farewell cigar with
Dickens, left for London and Scotland in October.</p></div>

does just now. He passed close by me on horseback, as I was
coming in at the door on Friday, and I never saw so haggard a face.

<span class="smcap">Rhia Rhama Rhoos</span>, educated cabalistically in the Orange Groves
of Salamanca and the Ocean Caves of Alum Bay," some of whose proposed
wonders it thus prefigures:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='center'>THE LEAPING CARD WONDER.
</div><p>
Two Cards being drawn from the
Pack by two of the company, and
placed, with the Pack, in the Necromancer's
box, will leap forth at the
command of any lady of not less than
eight, or more than eighty, years of
age.</p>
<p>
<sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> <i>This wonder is the result of
nine years' seclusion in the mines of
Russia.</i></p>
<div class='center'>
THE PYRAMID WONDER.
</div><p>
A shilling being lent to the Necromancer
by any gentleman of not less
than twelve months, or more than one
hundred years, of age, and carefully
marked by the said gentleman, will
disappear from within a brazen box
at the word of command, and pass
through the hearts of an infinity of
boxes, which will afterwards build
themselves into pyramids and sink
into a small mahogany box, at the
Necromancer's bidding.</p>
<p>
<sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> <i>Five thousand guineas were
paid for the acquisition of this wonder,
to a Chinese Mandarin, who
died of grief immediately after parting
with the secret.</i></p>
<div class='center'>
THE CONFLAGRATION WONDER.
</div><p>
A Card being drawn from the Pack
by any lady, not under a direct and
positive promise of marriage, will be
immediately named by the Necromancer,
destroyed by fire, and reproduced
from its own ashes.</p>
<p>
<sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> <i>An annuity of one thousand
pounds has been offered to the Necromancer
by the Directors of the
Sun Fire Office for the secret of this
wonder&mdash;and refused!!!</i></p>
<div class='center'>
THE LOAF OF BREAD WONDER.
</div><p>
The watch of any truly prepossessing
lady, of any age, single or married,
being locked by the Necromancer in
a strong box, will fly at the word of
command from within that box into
the heart of an ordinary half-quartern
loaf, whence it shall be cut out in the
presence of the whole company, whose
cries of astonishment will be audible
at a distance of some miles.</p>
<p>
<sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> <i>Ten years in the Plains of
Tartary were devoted to the study
of this wonder.</i></p>
<div class='center'>
THE TRAVELLING DOLL WONDER.
</div><p>
The travelling doll is composed of
solid wood throughout, but, by putting
on a travelling dress of the simplest
construction, becomes invisible, performs
enormous journeys in half a
minute, and passes from visibility to
invisibility with an expedition so astonishing
that no eye can follow its
transformations.</p>
<p>
<sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> <i>The Necromancer's attendant
usually faints on beholding this wonder,
and is only to be revived by the
administration of brandy and water.</i></p>
<div class='center'>
THE PUDDING WONDER.
</div><p>
The company having agreed among
themselves to offer to the Necromancer,
by way of loan, the hat of any
gentleman whose head has arrived at
maturity of size, the Necromancer,
without removing that hat for an instant
from before the eyes of the delighted
company, will light a fire in it,
make a plum pudding in his magic
saucepan, boil it over the said fire,
produce it in two minutes, thoroughly
done, cut it, and dispense it in portions
to the whole company, for their consumption
then and there; returning
the hat at last, wholly uninjured by
fire, to its lawful owner.</p>
<p>
<sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> <i>The extreme liberality of this
wonder awakening the jealousy of
the beneficent Austrian Government,
when exhibited in Milan, the Necromancer
had the honour to be seized,
and confined for five years in the
fortress of that city.</i></p>

necessarily silent as to the most touching traits recorded of him by
Dickens, because they refer to the generosity shown by him to an
English family in occupation of another of his houses, in connection
with whom his losses must have been considerable, but for whom
he had nothing but help and sympathy. Replying to some questions
about them, put by Dickens one day, he had only enlarged on their
sacrifices and self-denials. "Ah that family, unfortunate! 'And you,
Monsieur Beaucourt,' I said to him, 'you are unfortunate too, God
knows!' Upon which he said in the pleasantest way in the world, Ah,
Monsieur Dickens, thank you, don't speak of it!&mdash;And backed himself
down the avenue with his cap in his hand, as if he were going to
back himself straight into the evening star, without the ceremony of
dying first. I never did see such a gentle, kind heart."</p></div>

of this venture as to the unprotected property, I cede them the
right of translating all future Romances at a thousand francs (&pound;40)
each. Considering that I get so much for what is otherwise worth
nothing, and get my books before so clever and important a people, I
think this is not a bad move?" The first friend with whom he advised
about it, I should mention, was the famous Leipzig publisher,
M. Tauchnitz, in whose judgment, as well as in his honour and good
faith, he had implicit reliance, and who thought the offer fair. On the
17th of April he wrote: "On Monday I am going to dine with all my
translators at Hachette's, the bookseller who has made the bargain for
the complete edition, and who began this week to pay his monthly
&pound;40 for a year. I don't mean to go out any more. Please to imagine
me in the midst of my French dressers." He wrote an address for the
Edition in which he praised the liberality of his publishers and expressed
his pride in being so presented to the French people whom
he sincerely loved and honoured. Another word may be added. "It
is rather appropriate that the French translation edition will pay my
rent for the whole year, and travelling charges to boot."&mdash;24th of Feb.
1856.</p></div>

very curious indeed to go and see it; and it is an instance to me of
the powerful emotions from which art is shut out in England by the
conventionalities." After seeing it he writes: "The low cry of excitement
and expectation that goes round the house when any one of the
great situations is felt to be coming is very remarkable indeed. I suppose
there has not been so great a success of the genuine and worthy
kind (for the authors have really taken the French dramatic bull by
the horns, and put the adulterous wife in the right position), for many
years. When you come over and see it, you will say you never saw
anything so admirably done. There is one actor, Bignon (M. Delormel),
who has a good deal of Macready in him; sometimes looks
very like him; and who seems to me the perfection of manly good
sense." 17th of April 1856.</p></div>

on <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. "You remember my saying to you some time ago
how curious I thought it that <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> should be the only instance
of an universally popular book that could make no one laugh
and could make no one cry. I have been reading it again just now,
in the course of my numerous refreshings at those English wells, and
I will venture to say that there is not in literature a more surprising
instance of an utter want of tenderness and sentiment, than the death
of Friday. It is as heartless as <i>Gil Blas</i>, in a very different and far
more serious way. But the second part altogether will not bear enquiry.
In the second part of <i>Don Quixote</i> are some of the finest
things. But the second part of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is perfectly contemptible,
in the glaring defect that it exhibits the man who was 30
years on that desert island with no visible effect made on his character
by that experience. De Foe's women too&mdash;Robinson Crusoe's wife
for instance&mdash;are terrible dull commonplace fellows without breeches;
and I have no doubt he was a precious dry and disagreeable article
himself&mdash;I mean De Foe: not Robinson. Poor dear Goldsmith (I
remember as I write) derived the same impression."</p></div>

opera by Gluck, and the reader will not be sorry to have his description
of it. "Last night I saw Madame Viardot do Gluck's Orph&eacute;e.
It is a most extraordinary performance&mdash;pathetic in the highest degree,
and full of quite sublime acting. Though it is unapproachably
fine from first to last, the beginning of it, at the tomb of Eurydice, is
a thing that I cannot remember at this moment of writing, without
emotion. It is the finest presentation of grief that I can imagine.
And when she has received hope from the Gods, and encouragement
to go into the other world and seek Eurydice, Viardot's manner of
taking the relinquished lyre from the tomb and becoming radiant
again, is most noble. Also she recognizes Eurydice's touch, when at
length the hand is put in hers from behind, like a most transcendant
genius. And when, yielding to Eurydice's entreaties she has turned
round and slain her with a look, her despair over the body is grand in
the extreme. It is worth a journey to Paris to see, for there is no such
Art to be otherwise looked upon. Her husband stumbled over me by
mere chance, and took me to her dressing-room. Nothing could have
happened better as a genuine homage to the performance, for I was
disfigured with crying."&mdash;30th of November 1862.</p></div>

date is the 30th of January. "It was cold this afternoon, as bright as
Italy, and these Elysian Fields crowded with carriages, riders, and
foot passengers. All the fountains were playing, all the Heavens
shining. Just as I went out at 4 o'clock, several regiments that had
passed out at the Barri&egrave;re in the morning to exercise in the country,
came marching back, in the straggling French manner, which is far
more picturesque and real than anything you can imagine in that way.
Alternately great storms of drums played, and then the most delicious
and skilful bands, 'Trovatore' music, 'Barber of Seville' music, all
sorts of music with well-marked melody and time. All bloused Paris
(led by the Inimitable, and a poor cripple who works himself up and
down all day in a big wheeled car) went at quick march down the
avenue, in a sort of hilarious dance. If the colours with the golden
eagle on the top had only been unfurled, we should have followed
them anywhere, in any cause&mdash;much as the children follow Punches
in the better cause of Comedy. Napoleon on the top of the Column
seemed up to the whole thing, I thought."</p></div>

who came with him from America, so long a favourite in his household,
had died of old age a few weeks before (5th of Oct. 1855) in Boulogne.</p></div>

oceans of mud. Although numbers of men are perpetually
scooping and sweeping it away in this thoroughfare, it accumulates
under the windows so fast, and in such sludgy masses, that to get
across the road is to get half over one's shoes in the first outset of a
walk." .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "It is difficult," he added (20th of Jan.) "to picture the
change made in this place by the removal of the paving stones (too
ready for barricades), and macadamization. It suits neither the climate
nor the soil. We are again in a sea of mud. One cannot cross the
road of the Champs Elys&eacute;es here, without being half over one's boots."
A few more days brought a welcome change. "Three days ago the
weather changed here in an hour, and we have had bright weather and
hard frost ever since. All the mud disappeared with marvellous rapidity,
and the sky became Italian. Taking advantage of such a happy
change, I started off yesterday morning (for exercise and meditation)
on a scheme I have taken into my head, to walk round the walls of
Paris. It is a very odd walk, and will make a good description. Yesterday
I turned to the right when I got outside the Barri&egrave;re de l'Etoile,
walked round the wall till I came to the river, and then entered Paris
beyond the site of the Bastille. To-day I mean to turn to the left when
I get outside the Barri&egrave;re, and see what comes of that."</p></div>

Horace Vernet was nothing short of rapture; and how well I remember
the humour of his description of the Emperor on the day when
the prizes were given, and, as his old friend the great painter came up,
the comical expression in his face that said plainly "What a devilish
odd thing this is altogether, isn't it?" composing itself to gravity as he
took Edwin by the hand, and said in cordial English "I am very glad
to see you." He stood, Landseer told us, in a recess so arranged as
to produce a clear echo of every word he said, and this had a startling
effect. In the evening of that day Dickens, Landseer, Boxall, Leslie
"and three others" dined together in the Palais Royal.</p></div>

by Dickens, of the celebrated Charity at Rochester founded in the sixteenth

entertainment, and fourpence each." A quaint monument to Watts
is the most prominent object on the wall of the south-west transept of
the cathedral, and underneath it is now placed a brass thus inscribed:
"<span class="smcap">Charles Dickens</span>. Born at Portsmouth, seventh of February
1812. Died at Gadshill Place by Rochester, ninth of June 1870.
Buried in Westminster Abbey. To connect his memory with the
scenes in which his earliest and his latest years were passed, and with
the associations of Rochester Cathedral and its neighbourhood which
extended over all his life, this Tablet, with the sanction of the Dean
and Chapter, is placed by his Executors."</p></div>

which, even in so undignified a subject, might have interested Pope.
"You remember little Wieland who did grotesque demons so well.

be worth while to preserve his description of it. "I have been (by
mere accident) seeing the serpents fed to-day, with the live birds,
rabbits, and guinea pigs&mdash;a sight so very horrible that I cannot get rid
of the impression, and am, at this present, imagining serpents coming
up the legs of the table, with their infernal flat heads, and their tongues
like the Devil's tail (evidently taken from that model, in the magic
lanterns and other such popular representations), elongated for dinner.
I saw one small serpent, whose father was asleep, go up to a guinea
pig (white and yellow, and with a gentle eye&mdash;every hair upon him
erect with horror); corkscrew himself on the tip of his tail; open a
mouth which couldn't have swallowed the guinea pig's nose; dilate a
throat which wouldn't have made him a stocking; and show him what
his father meant to do with him when he came out of that ill-looking
Hookah into which he had resolved himself. The guinea pig backed
against the side of the cage&mdash;said 'I know it, I know it!'&mdash;and his eye
glared and his coat turned wiry, as he made the remark. Five small
sparrows crouching together in a little trench at the back of the cage,
peeped over the brim of it, all the time; and when they saw the guinea
pig give it up, and the young serpent go away looking at him over
about two yards and a quarter of shoulder, struggled which should
get into the innermost angle and be seized last. Everyone of
them then hid his eyes in another's breast, and then they all shook together
like dry leaves&mdash;as I daresay they may be doing now, for old
Hookah was as dull as laudanum.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Please to imagine two small
serpents, one beginning on the tail of a white mouse, and one on the
head, and each pulling his own way, and the mouse very much alive
all the time, with the middle of him madly writhing."</p></div>

theatre will supply the farce to this tragedy. "I have rarely seen anything
finer than Lord Glossmore, a chorus-singer in bluchers, drab
trowsers, and a brown sack; and Dudley Smooth, in somebody else's
wig, hindside before. Stout also, in anything he could lay hold of.
The waiter at the club had an immense moustache, white trowsers,
and a striped jacket; and he brought everybody who came in, a vinegar-cruet.
The man who read the will began thus: 'I so-and-so,
being of unsound mind but firm in body .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.' In spite of all this, however,
the real character, humour, wit, and good writing of the comedy,
made themselves apparent; and the applause was loud and repeated,
and really seemed genuine. Its capital things were not lost altogether.
It was succeeded by a Jockey Dance by five ladies, who put their
whips in their mouths and worked imaginary winners up to the float&mdash;an
immense success."</p></div>

hardly be conceived, and yet there were moments (really and truly
only moments) when the fancy would arise that if the conditions of
his life had been reversed, something of a vagabond existence (using
the word in Goldsmith's meaning) might have supervened. It would
have been an unspeakable misery to him, but it might have come
nevertheless. The question of hereditary transmission had a curious
attraction for him, and considerations connected with it were frequently
present to his mind. Of a youth who had fallen into a
father's weaknesses without the possibility of having himself observed
them for imitation, he thus wrote on one occasion: "It suggests the
strangest consideration as to which of our own failings we are really
responsible, and as to which of them we cannot quite reasonably hold
ourselves to be so. What A. evidently derived from his father cannot
in his case be derived from association and observation, but must be
in the very principles of his individuality as a living creature."</p></div>

without previous confidence from you. But nothing more. N&mdash;no.
Certainly not. Nothing more. I don't see that there is anything
derogatory in it, even now when you ask me that question. I think
upon the whole that most people would be glad you should have the
money, rather than other people. It might be misunderstood here
and there, at first; but I think the thing would very soon express
itself, and that your own power of making it express itself would be
very great.' As she wished me to ask B, who was in another room, I
did so. She was for a moment tremendously disconcerted, '<i>under
the impression that it was to lead to the stage</i>' (!!). Then, without
knowing anything of A's opinion, closely followed it. That absurd
association had never entered my head or yours; but it might enter
some other heads for all that. Take these two opinions for whatever
they are worth. A (being very much interested and very anxious
to help to a right conclusion) proposed to ask a few people of
various degrees who know what the Readings are, what <i>they</i> think&mdash;not
compromising me, but suggesting the project afar-off, as an
idea in somebody else's mind. I thanked her, and said 'Yes,' of
course."</p></div>

observe the limits originally placed to the proposal. The first Readings
were to comprise only the <i>Carol</i>, and for others a new story was
to be written. He had not yet the full confidence in his power or versatility
as an actor which subsequent experience gave him. "I propose
to announce in a short and plain advertisement (what is quite
true) that I cannot so much as answer the numerous applications that
are made to me to read, and that compliance with ever so few of them
is, in any reason, impossible. That I have therefore resolved upon a
course of readings of the <i>Christmas Carol</i> both in town and country,
and that those in London will take place at St. Martin's Hall on certain
evenings. Those evenings will be either four or six Thursdays, in
May and the beginning of June.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I propose an Autumn Tour, for
the country, extending through August, September, and October. It
would comprise the Eastern Counties, the West, Lancashire, Yorkshire,
and Scotland. I should read from 35 to 40 times in this tour,
at the least. At each place where there was a great success, I would
myself announce that I should come back, on the turn of Christmas, to
read a new Christmas story written for that purpose. This story I
should first read a certain number of times in London. I have the
strongest belief that by April in next year, a very large sum of money
indeed would be gained by these means. Ireland would be still untouched,
and I conceive America alone (if I could resolve to go there)
to be worth Ten Thousand Pounds. In all these proceedings, the
Business would be wholly detached from me, and I should never appear
in it. I would have an office, belonging to the Readings and to
nothing else, opened in London; I would have the advertisements
emanating from it, and also signed by some one belonging to it; and
they should always mention me as a third person&mdash;just as the Child's

little accompaniments of work (ii. 226) were carried along
with him; and of these I will quote what was written shortly after
his death by his son-in-law, Mr. Charles Collins, to illustrate a very
touching sketch by Mr. Fildes of his writing-desk and vacant chair.
"Ranged in front of, and round about him, were always a variety of
objects for his eye to rest on in the intervals of actual writing, and any
one of which he would have instantly missed had it been removed.
There was a French bronze group representing a duel with swords,
fought by a couple of very fat toads, one of them (characterised by
that particular buoyancy which belongs to corpulence) in the act of
making a prodigious lunge forward, which the other receives in the
very middle of his digestive apparatus, and under the influence of
which it seems likely that he will satisfy the wounded honour of his
opponent by promptly expiring. There was another bronze figure
which always stood near the toads, also of French manufacture, and
also full of comic suggestion. It was a statuette of a dog-fancier,
such a one as you used to see on the bridges or quays of Paris, with
a profusion of little dogs stuck under his arms and into his pockets,
and everywhere where little dogs could possibly be insinuated, all for
sale, and all, as even a casual glance at the vendor's exterior would
convince the most unsuspicious person, with some screw loose in their
physical constitutions or moral natures, to be discovered immediately
after purchase. There was the long gilt leaf with the rabbit sitting
erect upon its haunches, the huge paper-knife often held in his hand
during his public readings, and the little fresh green cup ornamented
with the leaves and blossoms of the cowslip, in which a few fresh
flowers were always placed every morning&mdash;for Dickens invariably
worked with flowers on his writing-table. There was also the register
of the day of the week and of the month, which stood always before
him; and when the room in the ch&acirc;let in which he wrote his last paragraph
was opened, some time after his death, the first thing to be
noticed by those who entered was this register, set at 'Wednesday,
June 8'&mdash;the day of his seizure." It remains to this day as it was found.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_226_226" id="Footnote_226_226"></a><a href="#FNanchor_226_226"><span class="label">[226]</span></a> Dickens's interest in dogs (as in the habits and ways of all animals)
was inexhaustible, and he welcomed with delight any new trait. The
subjoined, told him by a lady friend, was a great acquisition. "I
must close" (14th of May 1867) "with an odd story of a Newfoundland
dog. An immense black good-humoured Newfoundland dog.
He came from Oxford and had lived all his life at a brewery. Instructions
were given with him that if he were let out every morning
alone, he would immediately find out the river; regularly take a swim;
and gravely come home again. This he did with the greatest punctuality,
but after a little while was observed to smell of beer. She was
so sure that he smelt of beer that she resolved to watch him. Accordingly,
he was seen to come back from his swim, round the usual corner,
and to go up a flight of steps into a beer-shop. Being instantly
followed, the beer-shop-keeper is seen to take down a pot (pewter
pot), and is heard to say: 'Well, old chap! Come for your beer as
usual, have you?' Upon which he draws a pint and puts it down, and
the dog drinks it. Being required to explain how this comes to pass,
the man says, 'Yes ma'am. I know he's your dog ma'am, but I didn't
when he first come. He looked in ma'am&mdash;as a Brickmaker might&mdash;and
then he come in&mdash;as a Brickmaker might&mdash;and he wagged his tail
at the pots, and he giv' a sniff round, and conveyed to me as he was
used to beer. So I draw'd him a drop, and he drunk it up. Next
morning he come agen by the clock and I drawed him a pint, and
ever since he has took his pint reglar.'"</p></div>

he adds, "to a ludicrous state of distress by the quantity of silver we
have to carry about. Arthur Smith is always accompanied by an immense
black leather-bag full." Mr. Smith had an illness a couple of
days later, and Dickens whimsically describes his rapid recovery on
discovering the state of their balances. "He is now sitting opposite
to me on a bag of &pound;40 of silver. It must be dreadfully hard."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_228_228" id="Footnote_228_228"></a><a href="#FNanchor_228_228"><span class="label">[228]</span></a> A letter to his eldest daughter (23rd of Aug.) makes humorous
addition. "The man who drove our jaunting car yesterday hadn't a
piece in his coat as big as a penny roll, and had had his hat on (apparently
without brushing it) ever since he was grown-up. But he was
remarkably intelligent and agreeable, with something to say about
everything. For instance, when I asked him what a certain building
was, he didn't say 'Courts of Law' and nothing else, but 'Av yer
plase Sir, its the foor Coorts o' looyers, where Misther O'Connell
stood his trial wunst, as ye'll remimbir sir, afore I till ye ov it.' When
we got into the Ph&#339;nix Park, he looked round him as if it were his
own, and said '<span class="smcap">That's</span> a Park sir, av ye plase!' I complimented
it, and he said 'Gintlemen tills me as they iv bin, sir, over Europe and
never see a Park aqualling ov it. Yander's the Vice-regal Lodge, sir;
in thim two corners lives the two Sicretaries, wishing I was thim sir.
There's air here sir, av yer plase! There's scenery here sir! There's

He wrote to his sister-in-law: "Every night, by the bye, since I have
been in Ireland, the ladies have beguiled John out of the bouquet
from my coat; and yesterday morning, as I had showered the leaves
from my geranium in reading <i>Little Dombey</i>, they mounted the platform
after I was gone, and picked them all up as a keepsake." A
few days earlier he had written to the same correspondent: "The
papers are full of remarks upon my white tie, and describe it as being
of enormous size, which is a wonderful delusion; because, as you very
well know, it is a small tie. Generally, I am happy to report, the
Emerald press is in favour of my appearance, and likes my eyes. But
one gentleman comes out with a letter at Cork, wherein he says that
although only 46, I look like an old man."</p></div>

and the travelling party being always five." Another source of profit
was the sale of the copies of the several Readings prepared by himself.
"Our people alone sell eight, ten, and twelve dozen a night."
A later letter says: "The men with the reading books were sold out,
for about the twentieth time, at Manchester. Eleven dozen of the
<i>Poor Traveller</i>, <i>Boots</i>, and <i>Gamp</i> being sold in about ten minutes,
they had no more left; and Manchester became green with the little
tracts, in every bookshop, outside every omnibus, and passing along
every street. The sale of them, apart from us, must be very great."
"Did I tell you," he writes in another letter, "that the agents for our
tickets who are also booksellers, say very generally that the readings
decidedly increase the sale of the books they are taken from? We
were first told of this by a Mr. Parke, a wealthy old gentleman in a
very large way at Wolverhampton, who did all the business for love, and
would not take a farthing. Since then, we have constantly come upon
it; and M'Glashin and Gill at Dublin were very strong about it indeed."</p></div>

month which will show his quick and sure eye for any bit of acting out
of the common. The lady has since justified its closing prediction.
Describing an early dinner with Chauncy Townshend, he adds (17th
of December 1858): "I escaped at half-past seven, and went to the
Strand Theatre: having taken a stall beforehand, for it is always
crammed. I really wish you would go, between this and next Thursday,
to see the <i>Maid and the Magpie</i> burlesque there. There is the
strangest thing in it that ever I have seen on the stage. The boy,
Pippo, by Miss Wilton. While it is astonishingly impudent (must be,
or it couldn't be done at all), it is so stupendously like a boy, and unlike
a woman, that it is perfectly free from offence. I never have seen
such a thing. Priscilla Horton, as a boy, not to be thought of beside
it. She does an imitation of the dancing of the Christy Minstrels&mdash;wonderfully
clever&mdash;which, in the audacity of its thorough-going, is
surprising. A thing that you <i>can not</i> imagine a woman's doing at all;
and yet the manner, the appearance, the levity, impulse, and spirits of
it, are so exactly like a boy that you cannot think of anything like her
sex in association with it. It begins at 8, and is over by a quarter-past
9. I never have seen such a curious thing, and the girl's talent
is unchallengeable. I call her the cleverest girl I have ever seen on
the stage in my time, and the most singularly original."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_237_237" id="Footnote_237_237"></a><a href="#FNanchor_237_237"><span class="label">[237]</span></a> It is pleasant to have to state that it was still flourishing when I
received Mr. Lawes's letter, on the 18th of December 1871.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_238_238" id="Footnote_238_238"></a><a href="#FNanchor_238_238"><span class="label">[238]</span></a> From the same letter, dated 1st of July 1861, I take what follows.
"Poor Lord Campbell's seems to me as easy and good a death as one
could desire. There must be a sweep of these men very soon, and
one feels as if it must fall out like the breaking of an arch&mdash;one stone
goes from a prominent place, and then the rest begin to drop. So,
one looks, not without satisfaction (in our sadness) at lives so rounded
and complete, towards Brougham, and Lyndhurst, and Pollock" .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Yet, of Dickens's own death, Pollock lived to write to me as the death
of "one of the most distinguished and honoured men England has
ever produced; in whose loss every man among us feels that he
has lost a friend and an instructor." Temple-Hatton, 10th of June
1870.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_239_239" id="Footnote_239_239"></a><a href="#FNanchor_239_239"><span class="label">[239]</span></a> If space were available here, his letters would supply many proofs
of his interest in Mr. George Moore's admirable projects; but I can
only make exception for his characteristic allusion to an incident that
tickled his fancy very much at the time. "I hope" (20th of Aug. 1863)
"you have been as much amused as I am by the account of the
Bishop of Carlisle at (my very particular friend's) Mr. George Moore's
schools? It strikes me as the funniest piece of weakness I ever saw,
his addressing those unfortunate children concerning Colenso. I cannot
get over the ridiculous image I have erected in my mind, of the
shovel-hat and apron holding forth, at that safe distance, to that safe
audience. There is nothing so extravagant in Rabelais, or so satirically
humorous in Swift or Voltaire."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_240_240" id="Footnote_240_240"></a><a href="#FNanchor_240_240"><span class="label">[240]</span></a> Eight years later he wrote "Holiday Romance" for a Child's
Magazine published by Mr. Fields, and "George Silverman's Explanation"&mdash;of
the same length, and for the same price. There are no other
such instances, I suppose, in the history of literature.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_241_241" id="Footnote_241_241"></a><a href="#FNanchor_241_241"><span class="label">[241]</span></a> "You will be grieved," he wrote (Saturday 19th of Nov. 1859)
"to hear of poor Stone. On Sunday he was not well. On Monday,
went to Dr. Todd, who told him he had aneurism of the heart. On
Tuesday, went to Dr. Walsh, who told him he hadn't. On Wednesday
I met him in a cab in the Square here, and he got out to talk to
me. I walked about with him a little while at a snail's pace, cheering
him up; but when I came home, I told them that I thought him much
changed, and in danger. Yesterday at 2 o'clock he died of spasm of
the heart. I am going up to Highgate to look for a grave for him."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_242_242" id="Footnote_242_242"></a><a href="#FNanchor_242_242"><span class="label">[242]</span></a> He was now hard at work on his story; and a note written from
Gadshill after the funeral shows, what so frequently was incident to
his pursuits, the hard conditions under which sorrow, and its claim on
his exertion, often came to him. "To-morrow I have to work against
time and tide and everything else, to fill up a No. keeping open for
me, and the stereotype plates of which must go to America on Friday.
But indeed the enquiry into poor Alfred's affairs; the necessity of
putting the widow and children somewhere; the difficulty of knowing
what to do for the best; and the need I feel under of being as composed
and deliberate as I can be, and yet of not shirking or putting
off the occasion that there is for doing a duty; would have brought
me back here to be quiet, under any circumstances."</p></div>

is now going to press; the third being nearly out. Bulwer's story

"When the body was to be taken up and carried to the grave, there
stepped out, instead of the undertaker's men with their hideous paraphernalia,
the men who had always been with the two brothers at the
Egyptian Hall; and they, in their plain, decent, own mourning clothes,
carried the poor fellow away. Also, standing about among the gravestones,
dressed in black, I noticed every kind of person who had ever
had to do with him&mdash;from our own gas man and doorkeepers and
billstickers, up to Johnson the printer and that class of man. The
father and Albert and he now lie together, and the grave, I suppose,
will be no more disturbed I wrote a little inscription for the stone,

dreadfully. The sense I used to have of compactness and comfort
about me while I was reading, is quite gone; and on my coming out
for the ten minutes, when I used to find him always ready for me
with something cheerful to say, it is forlorn.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Besides which, H.
and all the rest of them are always somewhere, and he was always
everywhere."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_246_246" id="Footnote_246_246"></a><a href="#FNanchor_246_246"><span class="label">[246]</span></a> The more detailed account of the scene which he wrote to his
daughter is also well worth giving. "A most tremendous hall here
last night. Something almost terrible in the cram. A fearful thing
might have happened. Suddenly, when they were all very still over
Smike, my Gas Batten came down, and it looked as if the room were
falling. There were three great galleries crammed to the roof, and a
high steep flight of stairs; and a panic must have destroyed numbers
of people. A lady in the front row of stalls screamed, and ran out
wildly towards me, and for one instant there was a terrible wave in
the crowd. I addressed that lady, laughing (for I knew she was in
sight of everybody there), and called out as if it happened every night&mdash;'There's
nothing the matter I assure you; don't be alarmed; pray
sit down&mdash;&mdash;' and she sat down directly, and there was a thunder of
applause. It took some five minutes to mend, and I looked on with
my hands in my pockets; for I think if I had turned my back for
a moment, there might still have been a move. My people were
dreadfully alarmed&mdash;Boycott" (the gas-man) "in particular, who I
suppose had some notion that the whole place might have taken fire&mdash;'but
there stood the master,' he did me the honour to say afterwards,
in addressing the rest, 'as cool as ever I see him a lounging at a Railway
Station.'"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_247_247" id="Footnote_247_247"></a><a href="#FNanchor_247_247"><span class="label">[247]</span></a> The letter referred also to the death of his American friend Professor
Felton. "Your mention of poor Felton's death is a shock of
surprise as well as grief to me, for I had not heard a word about it.
Mr. Fields told me when he was here that the effect of that hotel disaster
of bad drinking water had not passed away; so I suppose, as
you do, that he sank under it. Poor dear Felton! It is 20 years since
I told you of the delight my first knowledge of him gave me, and it is
as strongly upon me to this hour. I wish our ways had crossed a little
oftener, but that would not have made it better for us now. Alas!
alas! all ways have the same finger-post at the head of them, and at
every turning in them."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_248_248" id="Footnote_248_248"></a><a href="#FNanchor_248_248"><span class="label">[248]</span></a> I give the letter in which he put the scheme formally before me,
after the renewed and larger offers had been submitted. "If there were
reasonable hope and promise, I could make up my mind to go to Australia
and get money. I would not accept the Australian people's
offer. I would take no money from them; would bind myself to nothing
with them; but would merely make them my agents at such
and such a per centage, and go and read there. I would take some
man of literary pretensions as a secretary (Charles Collins? What
think you?) and with his aid" (he afterwards made the proposal to his
old friend Mr. Thomas Beard) "would do, for <i>All the Year Round</i>
while I was away, The Uncommercial Traveller Upside Down. If the
notion of these speculators be anything like accurate, I should come
back rich. I should have seen a great deal of novelty to boot. I
should have been very miserable too.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of course one cannot possibly
count upon the money to be realized by a six months' absence,
but, &pound;12,000 is supposed to be a low estimate. Mr. S. brought me
letters from members of the legislature, newspaper editors, and the
like, exhorting me to come, saying how much the people talk of
me, and dwelling on the kind of reception that would await me. No
doubt this is so, and of course a great deal of curious experience for
after use would be gained over and above the money. Being my own
master too, I could 'work' myself more delicately than if I bound myself
for money beforehand. A few years hence, if all other circumstances
were the same, I might not be so well fitted for the excessive
wear and tear. This is about the whole case. But pray do not suppose
that I am in my own mind favourable to going, or that I have
any fancy for going." That was late in October. From Paris in November
(1862), he wrote: "I mentioned the question to Bulwer when
he dined with us here last Sunday, and he was all for going. He said
that not only did he think the whole population would go to the Readings,
but that the country would strike me in some quite new aspect
for a Book; and that wonders might be done with such book in the
way of profit, over there as well as here."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_249_249" id="Footnote_249_249"></a><a href="#FNanchor_249_249"><span class="label">[249]</span></a> A person present thus described (1st of February 1863) the second
night to Miss Dickens. "No one can imagine the scene of last Friday
night at the Embassy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a two hours' storm of excitement and pleasure.
They actually murmured and applauded right away into their
carriages and down the street."</p></div>

one day, a description of the condition of his wardrobe of which
he has also made note in the Memoranda. "Well, sir, your clothes

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_251_251" id="Footnote_251_251"></a><a href="#FNanchor_251_251"><span class="label">[251]</span></a> The date when this fancy dropped into his Memoranda is fixed by
the following passage in a letter to me of the 25th of August 1862.
"I am trying to coerce my thoughts into hammering out the Christmas
number. And I have an idea of opening a book (not the Christmas
number&mdash;a book) by bringing together two strongly contrasted places
and two strongly contrasted sets of people, with which and with whom
the story is to rest, through the agency of an electric message. I think a
fine thing might be made of the message itself shooting over the land and
under the sea, and it would be a curious way of sounding the key note."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_252_252" id="Footnote_252_252"></a><a href="#FNanchor_252_252"><span class="label">[252]</span></a> Following this in the "Memoranda" is an advertisement cut from
the <i>Times:</i> of a kind that always expressed to Dickens a child-farming
that deserved the gallows quite as much as the worst kind of
starving, by way of farming, babies. The fourteen guineas a-year,
"tender" age of the "dear" ones, maternal care, and no vacations or
extras, to him had only one meaning.</p>

<div class="blockquot">EDUCATION FOR LITTLE CHILDREN.&mdash;Terms

children. Maternal care and kindness may be relied on.&mdash;X.,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_253_253" id="Footnote_253_253"></a><a href="#FNanchor_253_253"><span class="label">[253]</span></a> There had been some estrangement between them since the autumn
of 1858, hardly now worth mention even in a note. Thackeray,
justly indignant at a published description of himself by the member
of a club to which both he and Dickens belonged, referred it to the
Committee, who decided to expel the writer. Dickens, thinking expulsion
too harsh a penalty for an offence thoughtlessly given, and, as
far as might be, manfully atoned for by withdrawal and regret, interposed
to avert that extremity. Thackeray resented the interference,
and Dickens was justly hurt by the manner in which he did so.
Neither was wholly right, nor was either altogether in the wrong.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_254_254" id="Footnote_254_254"></a><a href="#FNanchor_254_254"><span class="label">[254]</span></a> As I have thus fallen on theatrical subjects, I may add one or two
practical experiences which befell Dickens at theatres in the autumn
of 1864, when he sallied forth from his office upon these night wanderings
to "cool" a boiling head. "I went the other night" (8th of
October) "to see the <i>Streets of London</i> at the Princess's. A piece
that is really drawing all the town, and filling the house with nightly
overflows. It is the most depressing instance, without exception, of
an utterly degraded and debased theatrical taste that has ever come
under my writhing notice. For not only do the audiences&mdash;of all
classes&mdash;go, but they are unquestionably delighted. At Astley's there
has been much puffing at great cost of a certain Miss Ada Isaacs
Menkin, who is to be seen bound on the horse in <i>Mazeppa</i> 'ascending
the fearful precipices not as hitherto done by a dummy.' Last night,
having a boiling head, I went out from here to cool myself on Waterloo
Bridge, and I thought I would go and see this heroine. Applied
at the box-door for a stall. 'None left sir.' For a box-ticket. 'Only
standing-room sir.' Then the man (busy in counting great heaps of

you don't already know, ask that question of the highest Irish mountains
that look eternal, and they'll never tell you&mdash;<i>Mrs. Heenan!</i>"
This lady, who turned out to be one of Dickens's greatest admirers,
addressed him at great length on hearing of this occurrence, and afterwards
dedicated a volume of poems to him! There was a pleasanter
close to his letter. "Contrariwise I assisted another night at the
Adelphi (where I couldn't, with careful calculation, get the house up
to Nine Pounds), and saw quite an admirable performance of Mr.
Toole and Mrs. Mellon&mdash;she, an old servant, wonderfully like Anne&mdash;he,
showing a power of passion very unusual indeed in a comic actor,
as such things go, and of a quite remarkable kind."</p></div>

whom he had known from his boyhood (<i>ante</i>, i. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>-<a href="#Page_48">8</a>) and with whom
he had fought unsuccessfully for some years against the management
of the Literary Fund. "Poor Dilke! I am very sorry that the capital
old stout-hearted man is dead." Sorrow may also be expressed that
no adequate record should remain of a career which for steadfast purpose,
conscientious maintenance of opinion, and pursuit of public
objects with disregard of self, was one of very high example. So averse
was Mr. Dilke to every kind of display that his name appears to none
of the literary investigations which were conducted by him with an
acuteness wonderful as his industry, and it was in accordance with his
express instructions that the literary journal which his energy and self-denial
had established kept silence respecting him at his death.</p></div>

its ordinary sized companion." After a few days' holiday: "I began
to feel my foot stronger the moment I breathed the sea air. Still,
during the ten days I have been away, I have never been able to wear
a boot after four or five in the afternoon, but have passed all the evenings
with the foot up, and nothing on it. I am burnt brown and have
walked by the sea perpetually, yet I feel certain that if I wore a boot this
evening, I should be taken with those torments again before the night
was out." This last letter ended thus: "As a relief to my late dismal
letters, I send you the newest American story. Backwoods Doctor is
called in to the little boy of a woman-settler. Stares at the child some
time through a pair of spectacles. Ultimately takes them off, and
says to the mother: 'Wa'al Marm, this is small-pox. 'Tis Marm,
small-pox. But I am not posted up in Pustuls, and I do not know as
I could bring him along slick through it. But I'll tell you wa'at I can

discouraging were the accounts from here in London last
Tuesday that I held several <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'counils'">councils</ins> with Chappell about coming at
all; had actually drawn up a bill announcing (indefinitely) the postponement
of the readings; and had meant to give him a reading to
cover the charges incurred&mdash;but yielded at last to his representations
the other way. We ran through a snow storm nearly the whole way,
and in Wales got snowed up, came to a stoppage, and had to dig the
engine out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We got to Dublin at last, found it snowing and
raining, and heard that it had been snowing and raining since the first
day of the year.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As to outward signs of trouble or preparation,
they are very few. At Kingstown our boat was waited for by four
armed policemen, and some stragglers in various dresses who were
clearly detectives. But there was no show of soldiery. My people
carry a long heavy box containing gas-fittings. This was immediately
laid hold of; but one of the stragglers instantly interposed on seeing
my name, and came to me in the carriage and apologised.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
worst looking young fellow I ever saw, turned up at Holyhead before
we went to bed there, and sat glooming and glowering by the coffee-room
fire while we warmed ourselves. He said he had been snowed
up with us (which we didn't believe), and was horribly disconcerted
by some box of his having gone to Dublin without him. We said to
one another 'Fenian:' and certainly he disappeared in the morning,
and let his box go where it would." What Dickens heard and saw in
Dublin, during this visit, convinced him that Fenianism and disaffection
had found their way into several regiments.</p></div>

"THE CASE IN A NUTSHELL.<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='hang1'>"1. I think it may be taken as proved, that general enthusiasm and
excitement are awakened in America on the subject of the
Readings, and that the people are prepared to give me a great
reception. <i>The New York Herald</i>, indeed, is of opinion that
'Dickens must apologise first'; and where a <i>New York Herald</i>
is possible, anything is possible. But the prevailing tone, both
of the press and of people of all conditions, is highly favourable.
I have an opinion myself that the Irish element in New
York is dangerous; for the reason that the Fenians would be
glad to damage a conspicuous Englishman. This is merely an
opinion of my own.
</div><div class='hang1'>
"2. All our original calculations were based on 100 Readings. But
an unexpected result of careful enquiry on the spot, is the discovery
that the month of May is generally considered (in the
large cities) bad for such a purpose. Admitting that what
governs an ordinary case in this wise, governs mine, this reduces
the Readings to 80, and consequently at a blow makes a
reduction of 20 per cent., in the means of making money within
the half year&mdash;unless the objection should not apply in my
exceptional instance.
</div><div class='hang1'>
"3. I dismiss the consideration that the great towns of America
could not possibly be exhausted&mdash;or even visited&mdash;within 6
months, and that a large harvest would be left unreaped. Because
I hold a second series of Readings in America is to be
set down as out of the question: whether regarded as involving
two more voyages across the Atlantic, or a vacation of five
months in Canada.
</div><div class='hang1'>
"4. The narrowed calculation we have made, is this: What is the
largest amount of clear profit derivable, under the most advantageous
circumstances possible, as to their public reception,
from 80 Readings and no more? In making this calculation,
the expenses have been throughout taken on the New York
scale&mdash;which is the dearest; as much as 20 per cent., has been
deducted for management, including Mr. Dolby's commission;
and no credit has been taken for any extra payment on reserved
seats, though a good deal of money is confidently expected
from this source. But on the other hand it is to be observed
that four Readings (and a fraction over) are supposed to take
place every week, and that the estimate of receipts is based on
the assumption that the audiences are, on all occasions, as large
as the rooms will reasonably hold.
</div><div class='hang1'>
"5. So considering 80 Readings, we bring out the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'nett'">net</ins> profit of that
number, remaining to me after payment of all charges whatever,
as &pound;15,500.
</div><div class='hang1'>
"6. But it yet remains to be noted that the calculation assumes
New York City, and the State of New York, to be good for a
very large proportion of the 80 Readings; and that the calculation
also assumes the necessary travelling not to extend
beyond Boston and adjacent places, New York City and adjacent
places, Philadelphia, Washington, and Baltimore. But,
if the calculation should prove too sanguine on this head, and
if these places should <i>not</i> be good for so many Readings, then
it may prove impracticable to get through 80 within the time:
by reason of other places that would come into the list, lying
wide asunder, and necessitating long and fatiguing journeys.

gold (with gold at the present ruling premium) is allowed for
in the calculation. It counts seven dollars to the pound."</div>

well as this which follows: "What seems preposterous, impossible to
us, seemed to him simple fact of observation. When he imagined a
street, a house, a room, a figure, he saw it not in the vague schematic
way of ordinary imagination, but in the sharp definition of actual perception,
all the salient details obtruding themselves on his attention.
He, seeing it thus vividly, made us also see it; and believing in its
reality however fantastic, he communicated something of his belief to
us. He presented it in such relief that we ceased to think of it as a
picture. So definite and insistent was the image, that even while
knowing it was false we could not help, for a moment, being affected,
as it were, by his hallucination."</p></div>

himself on his pillow with a groan of torment, he usually continued
the sentence in the same breath. But when dialogue of peculiar animation
was in progress, spirit seemed to triumph altogether over matter&mdash;he
arose from his couch and walked up and down the room, raising
and lowering his voice, and as it were acting the parts." <i>Lockhart</i>,
vi. 67-8. The statement of James Ballantyne is at p. 89 of the same
volume. The original incidents on which Scott had founded the tale
he remembered, but "not a single character woven by the romancer,
not one of the many scenes and points of humour, nor anything with
which he was connected as the writer of the work."</p></div>

no opinion on this comparison, I may state it as within
my knowledge that the book referred to was not then known to
Dickens.</p></div>

(<i>Memoirs and Letters</i>, ii. 169) in writing of her children. "They

never-to-be-exhausted fun of <i>Pickwick</i>, and the capital new strokes of
<i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>. This last work contains, besides all the fun, some
very marked and available morals. I scarce know any book in which
the evil and odiousness of selfishness are more forcibly brought out, or
in a greater variety of exhibitions. In the midst of the merry quotations,
or at least on any fair opportunity, I draw the boys' attention to
these points."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_265_265" id="Footnote_265_265"></a><a href="#FNanchor_265_265"><span class="label">[265]</span></a> All the remarks in my text had been some time in type when Lord
Lytton sent me what follows, from one of his father's manuscript (and
unpublished) note-books. Substantially it agrees with what I have
said; and such unconscious testimony of a brother novelist of so high
a rank, careful in the study of his art, is of special value. "The
greatest masters of the novel of modern manners have generally availed
themselves of Humour for the illustration of manners; and have, with
a deep and true, but perhaps unconscious, knowledge of art, pushed
the humour almost to the verge of caricature. For, as the serious
ideal requires a certain exaggeration in the proportions of the natural,
so also does the ludicrous. Thus Aristophanes, in painting the
humours of his time, resorts to the most poetical extravagance of
machinery, and calls the Clouds in aid of his ridicule of philosophy,
or summons Frogs and Gods to unite in his satire on Euripides. The
Don Quixote of Cervantes never lived, nor, despite the vulgar belief,
ever could have lived, in Spain; but the art of the portrait is in the
admirable exaltation of the humorous by means of the exaggerated.
With more or less qualification, the same may be said of Parson
Adams, of Sir Roger de Coverley, and even of the Vicar of Wakefield.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It follows therefore that art and correctness are far from identical,
and that the one is sometimes proved by the disdain of the other.
For the ideal, whether humorous or serious, does not consist in the
imitation but in the exaltation of nature. And we must accordingly
enquire of art, not how far it resembles what we have seen, so much as
how far it embodies what we can imagine."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_266_266" id="Footnote_266_266"></a><a href="#FNanchor_266_266"><span class="label">[266]</span></a> I cannot refuse myself the satisfaction of quoting, from the best
criticism of Dickens I have seen since his death, remarks very pertinent
to what is said in my text. "Dickens possessed an imagination
unsurpassed, not only in vividness, but in swiftness. I have intentionally
avoided all needless comparisons of his works with those of
other writers of his time, some of whom have gone before him to their
rest, while others survive to gladden the darkness and relieve the
monotony of our daily life. But in the power of his imagination&mdash;of
this I am convinced&mdash;he surpassed them, one and all. That imagination
could call up at will those associations which, could we but summon
them in their full number, would bind together the human family,
and make that expression no longer a name, but a living reality.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Such associations sympathy alone can warm into life, and imagination
alone can at times discern. The great humourist reveals them to
every one of us; and his genius is indeed an inspiration from no
human source, in that it enables him to render this service to the
brotherhood of mankind. But more than this. So marvellously has
this earth become the inheritance of mankind, that there is not a thing
upon it, animate or inanimate, with which, or with the likeness of
which, man's mind has not come into contact; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with which
human feelings, aspirations, thoughts, have not acquired an endless
variety of single or subtle associations.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. These also, which we
imperfectly divine or carelessly pass by, the imagination of genius distinctly
reveals to us, and powerfully impresses upon us. When they
appeal directly to the emotions of the heart, it is the power of Pathos
which has awakened them; and when the suddenness, the unexpectedness,
the apparent oddity of the one by the side of the other, strike
the mind with irresistible force, it is the equally divine gift of Humour
which has touched the spring of laughter by the side of the spring of
tears."&mdash;<i>Charles Dickens. A Lecture by Professor Ward. Delivered
in Manchester, 30th November, 1870.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_267_267" id="Footnote_267_267"></a><a href="#FNanchor_267_267"><span class="label">[267]</span></a> The opening of this letter (25th of August 1859), referring to a
conviction for murder, afterwards reversed by a Home Office pardon
against the continued and steadily expressed opinion of the judge who
tried the case, is much too characteristic of the writer to be lost. "I
cannot easily tell you how much interested I am by what you tell
me of our brave and excellent friend.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have often had more than
half a mind to write and thank that upright judge. I declare to
heaven that I believe such a service one of the greatest that a man of
intellect and courage can render to society.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of course I have been
driving the girls out of their wits here, by incessantly proclaiming that
there needed no medical evidence either way, and that the case was
plain without it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lastly of course (though a merciful man&mdash;because
a merciful man, I mean), I would hang any Home Secretary, Whig,
Tory, Radical, or otherwise, who should step in between so black a
scoundrel and the gallows.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am reminded of Tennyson by thinking
that King Arthur would have made short work of the amiable man!
How fine the Idylls are! Lord! what a blessed thing it is to read a
man who really can write. I thought nothing could be finer than the
first poem, till I came to the third; but when I had read the last, it
seemed to me to be absolutely unapproachable." Other literary
likings rose and fell with him, but he never faltered in his allegiance
to Tennyson.</p></div>

("I am sure and certain, Biddy" as originally written, altered to "O
no&mdash;I think not, Biddy"): from which point here was the close. "It
was two years more, before I saw herself. I had heard of her as leading
a most unhappy life, and as being separated from her husband
who had used her with great cruelty, and who had become quite renowned
as a compound of pride, brutality, and meanness. I had
heard of the death of her husband (from an accident consequent on
ill-treating a horse), and of her being married again to a Shropshire
doctor, who, against his interest, had once very manfully interposed,
on an occasion when he was in professional attendance on Mr.
Drummle, and had witnessed some outrageous treatment of her. I had
heard that the Shropshire doctor was not rich, and that they lived on
her own personal fortune. I was in England again&mdash;in London, and
walking along Piccadilly with little Pip&mdash;when a servant came running
after me to ask would I step back to a lady in a carriage who wished
to speak to me. It was a little pony carriage, which the lady was
driving; and the lady and I looked sadly enough on one another.
'I am greatly changed, I know; but I thought you would like to
shake hands with Estella too, Pip. Lift up that pretty child and let
me kiss it!' (She supposed the child, I think, to be my child.) I was
very glad afterwards to have had the interview; for, in her face and in
her voice, and in her touch, she gave me the assurance, that suffering
had been stronger than Miss Havisham's teaching, and had given her
a heart to understand what my heart used to be."</p></div>

story under notice. "On Friday the ninth of June in the present
year, Mr. and Mrs. Boffin (in their manuscript dress of receiving Mr.
and Mrs. Lammle at breakfast) were on the South-Eastern Railway
with me, in a terribly destructive accident. When I had done what I
could to help others, I climbed back into my carriage&mdash;nearly turned
over a viaduct, and caught aslant upon the turn&mdash;to extricate the
worthy couple. They were much soiled, but otherwise unhurt. The
same happy result attended Miss Bella Wilfer on her wedding-day,

the third day after Dickens's death, in the Abbey where he was so
soon to be laid, closed a plea for the toleration of differences of opinion
where the foundations of religious truth are accepted, with these words.
"It will not be out of harmony with the line of thought we have been
pursuing&mdash;certainly it will be in keeping with the associations of this
place, dear to Englishmen, not only as one of the proudest Christian temples,
but as containing the memorials of so many who by their genius
in arts, or arms, or statesmanship, or literature, have made England
what she is&mdash;if in the simplest and briefest words I allude to that sad
and unexpected death which has robbed English literature of one of
its highest living ornaments, and the news of which, two mornings ago,
must have made every household in England feel as though they had
lost a personal friend. He has been called in one notice an apostle
of the people. I suppose it is meant that he had a mission, but in a
style and fashion of his own; a gospel, a cheery, joyous, gladsome
message, which the people understood, and by which they could hardly
help being bettered; for it was the gospel of kindliness, of brotherly
love, of sympathy in the widest sense of the word. I am sure I have
felt in myself the healthful spirit of his teaching. Possibly we might
not have been able to subscribe to the same creed in relation to God,
but I think we should have subscribed to the same creed in relation to
man. He who has taught us our duty to our fellow men better than
we knew it before, who knew so well to weep with them that wept,
and to rejoice with them that rejoiced, who has shown forth in all his
knowledge of the dark corners of the earth how much sunshine may
rest upon the lowliest lot, who had such evident sympathy with suffering,
and such a natural instinct of purity that there is scarcely a page
of the thousands he has written which might not be put into the hands
of a little child, must be regarded by those who recognise the diversity
of the gifts of the spirit as a teacher sent from God. He would have
been welcomed as a fellow-labourer in the common interests of humanity
by Him who asked the question 'If a man love not his brother
whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?'"</p></div>

naturalist and philosopher, Agassiz, whose death is unhappily announced
while I write, and as to whom it will no longer be unbecoming
to quote his allusion. "Agassiz, who married the last Mrs. Felton's
sister, is not only one of the most accomplished but the most natural
and jovial of men." Again he says: "I cannot tell you how pleased
I was by Agassiz, a most charming fellow, or how I have regretted his
seclusion for a while by reason of his mother's death." A valued correspondent,
Mr. Grant Wilson, sends me a list of famous Americans
who greeted Dickens at his first visit, and in the interval had passed
away. "It is melancholy to contemplate the large number of American
authors who had, between the first and second visits of Mr.
Dickens, 'gone hence, to be no more seen.' The sturdy Cooper, the
gentle Irving, his friend and kinsman Paulding, Prescott the historian
and Percival the poet, the eloquent Everett, Nathaniel Hawthorne,
Edgar A. Poe, N. P. Willis, the genial Halleck, and many lesser lights,
including Prof. Felton and Geo. P. Morris, had died during the
quarter of a century that elapsed between Dickens's visits to this country,
leaving a new generation of writers to extend the hand of friendship
to him on his second coming."&mdash;Let me add to this that Dickens
was pleased, at this second visit, to see his old secretary who had
travelled so agreeably with him through his first tour of triumph.
"He would have known him anywhere."</p></div>

help laughing at myself on my birthday at Washington; it was observed
so much as though I were a little boy. Flowers and garlands
of the most exquisite kind, arranged in all manner of green baskets,
bloomed over the room; letters radiant with good wishes poured in;
a shirt pin, a handsome silver travelling bottle, a set of gold shirt studs,
and a set of gold sleeve links, were on the dinner table. Also, by
hands unknown, the hall at night was decorated; and after <i>Boots at the
Holly Tree</i>, the whole audience rose and remained, great people and
all, standing and cheering, until I went back to the table and made
them a little speech."</p></div>

happy result by sending out some advertisements in these exact words:
"The Reading will be comprised within <i>two minutes</i>, and the audience

He had transposed the minutes and the hours.</p></div>

have arranged with Chappell to take my leave of reading for good and
all, in a hundred autumnal and winter Farewells <i>for ever</i>. I return
by the Cunard steam-ship 'Russia.' I had the second officer's cabin

in America. "I cannot eat (to anything like the necessary extent) and
have established this system. At 7 in the morning, in bed, a tumbler
of new cream and two tablespoonsful of rum. At 12, a sherry cobbler
and a biscuit. At 3 (dinner time) a pint of champagne. At five minutes
to 8, an egg beaten up with a glass of sherry. Between the parts,
the strongest beef tea that can be made, drunk hot. At a quarter past
10, soup, and any little thing to drink that I can fancy. I do not eat
more than half a pound of solid food in the whole four-and-twenty
hours, if so much."</p></div>

the hosts began to assemble, but at 5.30 news was received that
the expected guest had succumbed to a painful affection of the foot.
In a short time, however, another bulletin announced Mr. Dickens's
intention to attend the dinner at all hazards. At a little after six,
having been assisted up the stairs, he was joined by Mr. Greeley, and
the hosts forming in two lines silently permitted the distinguished gentlemen
to pass through. Mr. Dickens limped perceptibly; his right
foot was swathed, and he leaned heavily on the arm of Mr. Greeley.
He evidently suffered great pain."</p></div>

excused for printing in a note. "The only news that will interest you
is that the good-natured Reverdy Johnson, being at an Art Dinner in
Glasgow the other night, and falling asleep over the post-prandial
speeches (only too naturally), woke suddenly on hearing the name of
'Johnson' in a list of Scotch painters which one of the orators was
enumerating; at once plunged up, under the impression that somebody
was drinking his health; and immediately, and with overflowing
amiability, began returning thanks. The spectacle was then presented
to the astonished company, of the American Eagle being restrained by
the coat tails from swooping at the moon, while the smaller birds
endeavoured to explain to it how the case stood, and the cock robin in
possession of the chairman's eye twittered away as hard as he could
split. I am told that it was wonderfully droll."</p></div>

night before last, unable to get in, B. had a seat behind the screen, and
was nearly frightened off it, by the Murder. Every vestige of colour
had left his face when I came off, and he sat staring over a glass of
champagne in the wildest way."</p></div>

1869) "for your great kindness and interest. It would really pain me
if I thought you could seriously doubt my implicit reliance on your
professional skill and advice. I feel as certain now as I felt when you
came to see me on my breaking down through over fatigue, that the
injunction you laid upon me to stop in my course of Readings was
necessary and wise. And to its firmness I refer (humanly speaking)
my speedy recovery from that moment. I would on no account have
resumed, even on the turn of this year, without your sanction. Your
friendly aid will never be forgotten by me; and again I thank you for
it with all my heart."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_285_285" id="Footnote_285_285"></a><a href="#FNanchor_285_285"><span class="label">[285]</span></a> In drawing the agreement for the publication, Mr. Ouvry had,
by Dickens's wish, inserted a clause thought to be altogether needless,
but found to be sadly pertinent. It was the first time such a
clause had been inserted in one of his agreements. "That if the said
Charles Dickens shall die during the composition of the said work of
the <i>Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>, or shall otherwise become incapable of
completing the said work for publication in twelve monthly numbers as
agreed, it shall be referred to John Forster, Esq, one of Her Majesty's
Commissioners in Lunacy, or in the case of his death, incapacity, or
refusal to act, then to such person as shall be named by Her Majesty's
Attorney-General for the time being, to determine the amount which
shall be repaid by the said Charles Dickens, his executors or administrators,
to the said Frederic Chapman as a fair compensation for so
much of the said work as shall not have been completed for publication."
The sum to be paid at once for 25,000 copies was &pound;7500; publisher
and author sharing equally in the profit of all sales beyond that
impression; and the number reached, while the author yet lived, was
50,000. The sum paid for early sheets to America was &pound;1000; and
Baron Tauchnitz paid liberally, as he always did, for his Leipzig
reprint. "All Mr. Dickens's works," M. Tauchnitz writes to me,
"have been published under agreement by me. My intercourse with
him lasted nearly twenty-seven years. The first of his letters dates in
October 1843, and his last at the close of March 1870. Our long relations
were not only never troubled by the least disagreement, but
were the occasion of most hearty personal feeling; and I shall never
lose the sense of his kind and friendly nature. On my asking him his
terms for <i>Edwin Drood</i>, he replied 'Your terms shall be mine.'"</p></div>

only two chapters. A thing never to melt into other stories in the
mind, but always to keep itself apart." The story was published in
the 37th number of the new series of <i>All the Year Round</i>, with the
title of "An Experience." The "new series" had been started to
break up the too great length of volumes in sequence, and the only
change it announced was the discontinuance of Christmas Numbers.
He had tired of them himself; and, observing the extent to which they
were now copied in all directions (as usual with other examples set by
him), he supposed them likely to become tiresome to the public.</p></div>

"I went lately with the same inspector who accompanied
Dickens to see the room of the opium-smokers, old Eliza and her Lascar
or Bengalee friend. There a fancy seized me to buy the bedstead
which figures so accurately in <i>Edwin Drood</i>, in narrative and picture.
I gave the old woman a pound for it, and have it now packed and
ready for shipment to New York. Another American bought a pipe.
So you see we have heartily forgiven the novelist his pleasantries at
our expense. Many military men who came to England from America
refuse to register their titles, especially if they be Colonels; all the
result of the basting we got on that score in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>."</p></div>

Halleck (author of one of the most delightful poems ever
written about Burns) which exactly expresses Dickens as he was, not
only in 1842, but, as far as the sense of authorship went, all his life.
It was addressed to Mrs. Rush of Philadelphia, and is dated the 8th
of March 1842. "You ask me about Mr. Boz. I am quite delighted
with him. He is a thorough good fellow, with nothing of the author
about him but the reputation, and goes through his task as Lion with
exemplary grace, patience, and good nature. He has the brilliant
face of a man of genius.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His writings you know. I wish you had
listened to his eloquence at the dinner here. It was the only real
specimen of eloquence I have ever witnessed. Its charm was not in
its words, but in the manner of saying them."</p></div>

in an otherwise indifferently written paper descriptive of the typical
Englishman on the foreign stage, which gives in more comic detail experiences
of his own already partly submitted to the reader (<a href="#Page_2_294">ii. 127</a>).
"In a pretty piece at the Gymnase in Paris, where the prime minister
of England unfortunately ruined himself by speculating in railway
shares, a thorough-going English servant appeared under that thorough-going
English name Tom Bob&mdash;the honest fellow having been christened
Tom, and born the lawful son of Mr. and Mrs. Bob. In an
Italian adaptation of <span class="smcap">Dumas</span>' preposterous play of <span class="smcap">Kean</span>, which we
once saw at the great theatre of Genoa, the curtain rose upon that
celebrated tragedian, drunk and fast asleep in a chair, attired in a dark
blue blouse fastened round the waist with a broad belt and a most prodigious
buckle, and wearing a dark red hat of the sugar-loaf shape,
nearly three feet high. He bore in his hand a champagne-bottle, with
the label <span class="smcap">Rhum</span>, in large capital letters, carefully turned towards the
audience; and two or three dozen of the same popular liquor, which
we are nationally accustomed to drink neat as imported, by the half
gallon, ornamented the floor of the apartment. Every frequenter of
the Coal Hole tavern in the Strand, on that occasion, wore a sword
and a beard. Every English lady, presented on the stage in Italy,
wears a green veil; and almost every such specimen of our fair countrywomen
carries a bright red reticule, made in the form of a monstrous
heart. We do not remember to have ever seen an Englishman
on the Italian stage, or in the Italian circus, without a stomach like
Daniel Lambert, an immense shirt-frill, and a bunch of watch-seals
each several times larger than his watch, though the watch itself was
an impossible engine. And we have rarely beheld this mimic Englishman,
without seeing present, then and there, a score of real Englishmen
sufficiently characteristic and unlike the rest of the audience,
to whom he bore no shadow of resemblance." These views as to
English people and society, of which Count d'Orsay used always to
say that an average Frenchman knew about as much as he knew of
the inhabitants of the moon, may receive amusing addition from one
of Dickens's letters during his last visit to France; which enclosed a
cleverly written Paris journal containing essays on English manners.
In one of these the writer remarked that he had heard of the venality
of English politicians, but could not have supposed it to be so shameless
as it is, for, when he went to the House of Commons, he heard
them call out "Places! Places!" "Give us Places!" when the Minister
entered.</p></div>

article of which the closing sentences find fitting place in his biography.
"If there be anything in Lord Russell's theory that Life Peerages are
wanted specially to represent those forms of national eminence which
cannot otherwise find fitting representation, it might be urged, for the
reasons we have before mentioned, that a Life Peerage is due to the
most truly national representative of one important department of
modern English literature. Something may no doubt be said in favour
of this view, but we are inclined to doubt if Mr. Dickens himself would
gain anything by a Life Peerage. Mr. Dickens is pre-eminently a
writer of the people and for the people. To our thinking, he is far
better suited for the part of the 'Great Commoner' of English fiction
than for even a Life Peerage. To turn Charles Dickens into Lord
Dickens would be much the same mistake in literature that it was in
politics to turn William Pitt into Lord Chatham."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_298_298" id="Footnote_298_298"></a><a href="#FNanchor_298_298"><span class="label">[298]</span></a> One of the many repetitions of the same opinion in his letters may
be given. "Lord John's note" (September 1853) "confirms me in an
old impression that he is worth a score of official men; and has more
generosity in his little finger than a Government usually has in its
whole corporation." In another of his public allusions, Dickens
described him as a statesman of whom opponents and friends alike
felt sure that he would rise to the level of every occasion, however
exalted; and compared him to the seal of Solomon in the old Arabian
story inclosing in a not very large casket the soul of a giant.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_299_299" id="Footnote_299_299"></a><a href="#FNanchor_299_299"><span class="label">[299]</span></a> In a memoir by Dr. Shelton McKenzie which has had circulation
in America, there is given the following statement, taken doubtless
from publications at the time, of which it will be strictly accurate to
say, that, excepting the part of its closing averment which describes
Dickens sending a copy of his works to her Majesty by her own desire,
<i>there is in it not a single word of truth</i>. "Early in 1870 the Queen
presented a copy of her book upon the Highlands to Mr. Dickens,
with the modest autographic inscription, 'from the humblest to the
most distinguished author of England.' This was meant to be complimentary,
and was accepted as such by Mr. Dickens, who acknowledged
it in a manly, courteous letter. Soon after, Queen Victoria wrote
to him, requesting that he would do her the favour of paying her a
visit at Windsor. He accepted, and passed a day, very pleasantly,
in his Sovereign's society. It is said that they were mutually pleased,
that Mr. Dickens caught the royal lady's particular humour, that they
chatted together in a very friendly manner, that the Queen was never
tired of asking questions about certain characters in his books, that
they had almost a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> luncheon, and that, ere he departed, the
Queen pressed him to accept a baronetcy (a title which descends to the
eldest son), and that, on his declining, she said, 'At least, Mr. Dickens,
let me have the gratification of making you one of my Privy Council.'
This, which gives the personal title of 'Right Honourable,' he also
declined&mdash;nor, indeed, did Charles Dickens require a title to give him
celebrity. The Queen and the author parted, well pleased with each
other. The newspapers reported that a peerage had been offered and
declined&mdash;<i>but even newspapers are not invariably correct</i>. Mr. Dickens
presented his Royal Mistress with a handsome set of all his works,
and, on the very morning of his death, a letter reached Gad's Hill,
written by Mr. Arthur Helps, by her desire, acknowledging the present,
and describing the exact position the books occupied at Balmoral&mdash;so
placed that she could see them before her when occupying the usual
seat in her sitting-room. When this letter arrived, Mr. Dickens was
still alive, but wholly unconscious. What to him, at that time, was
the courtesy of an earthly sovereign?" I repeat that the only morsel
of truth in all this rigmarole is that the books were sent by Dickens,
and acknowledged by Mr. Helps at the Queen's desire. The letter
did not arrive on the day of his death, the 9th of June, but was dated
from Balmoral on that day.</p></div>

'<i>W. M. Thackeray, from Charles Dickens (whom he made very happy
once a long way from home</i>).'" Some pleasant verses by his friend
had affected him much while abroad. I quote the Life of Dickens
published by Mr. Hotten. "Her Majesty expressed the strongest
desire to possess this presentation copy, and sent an unlimited commission
to buy it. The original published price of the book was 5<i>s.</i>
It became Her Majesty's property for &pound;25 10<i>s.</i>, and was at once taken

Diary by Mr. Payne Collier, appeared lately in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>,
having reference to Dickens at the time when he first obtained employment
as a reporter, and connecting itself with what my opening
volume had related of those childish sufferings. "Soon afterwards
I observed a great difference in C. D.'s dress, for he had bought a new
hat and a very handsome blue cloak, which he threw over his shoulder
<i>&agrave; l' Espagnole</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We walked together through Hungerford Market,
where we followed a coal-heaver, who carried his little rosy but grimy
child looking over his shoulder; and C. D. bought a halfpenny-worth
of cherries, and as we went along he gave them one by one to the
little fellow without the knowledge of the father.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He informed me
as we walked through it that he knew Hungerford Market well.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
He did not affect to conceal the difficulties he and his family had had
to contend against."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_303_303" id="Footnote_303_303"></a><a href="#FNanchor_303_303"><span class="label">[303]</span></a> I desire to guard myself against any possible supposition that I
think these Readings might have been stopped by the exercise of medical
authority. I am convinced of the contrary. Dickens had pledged
himself to them; and the fact that others' interests were engaged rather
than his own supplied him with an overpowering motive for being
determinedly set on going through with them. At the sorrowful time
in the preceding year, when, yielding to the stern sentence passed by
Sir Thomas Watson, he had dismissed finally the staff employed on
his country readings, he had thus written to me. "I do believe" (3rd
of May 1869) "that such people as the Chappells are very rarely to be
found in human affairs. To say nothing of their noble and munificent
manner of sweeping away into space all the charges incurred uselessly,
and all the immense inconvenience and profitless work thrown
upon their establishment, comes a note this morning from the senior
partner, to the effect that they feel that my overwork has been 'indirectly
caused by them, and by my great and kind exertions to make
their venture successful to the extreme.' There is something so delicate
and fine in this, that I feel it deeply." That feeling led to his
resolve to make the additional exertion of these twelve last readings,
and nothing would have turned him from it as long as he could stand
at the desk.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_304_304" id="Footnote_304_304"></a><a href="#FNanchor_304_304"><span class="label">[304]</span></a> I preserve also the closing words of the letter. "It is very strange&mdash;you
remember I suppose?&mdash;that the last time we spoke of him together,
you said that we should one day hear that the wayward life
into which he had fallen was over, and there an end of our knowledge
of it." The waywardness, which was merely the having latterly withdrawn
himself too much from old friendly intercourse, had its real
origin in disappointments connected with the public work on which he
was engaged in those later years, and to which he sacrificed every
private interest of his own. His was only the common fate of Englishmen,
so engaged, who do this; and when the real story of the "Fresco-painting
for the Houses of Parliament" comes to be written, it will
be another chapter added to our national misadventures and reproaches
in everything connected with Art and its hapless cultivators.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_305_305" id="Footnote_305_305"></a><a href="#FNanchor_305_305"><span class="label">[305]</span></a> It is a duty to quote these eloquent words. "Statesmen, men of
science, philanthropists, the acknowledged benefactors of their race,
might pass away, and yet not leave the void which will be caused by
the death of Dickens. They may have earned the esteem of mankind;
their days may have been passed in power, honour, and prosperity;
they may have been surrounded by troops of friends; but, however
pre-eminent in station, ability, or public services, they will not have
been, like our great and genial novelist, the intimate of every household.
Indeed, such a position is attained not even by one man in an age. It
needs an extraordinary combination of intellectual and moral qualities .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
before the world will thus consent to enthrone a man as their unassailable
and enduring favourite. This is the position which Mr. Dickens
has occupied with the English and also with the American public for
the third of a century.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Westminster Abbey is the peculiar resting-place
of English literary genius; and among those whose sacred dust
lies there, or whose names are recorded on the walls, very few are
more worthy than Charles Dickens of such a home. Fewer still, we
believe, will be regarded with more honour as time passes and his
